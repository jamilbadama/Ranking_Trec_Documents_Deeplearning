Prostate Cancer,Analysis of the Mechanisms of Actions of Heat Shock Protein (Hsp27) Responsible of the Androgen-independent Evolution in Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer (PC) represents one of the most common cancers in industrialized countries. Patients with localized disease may be treated with surgery or radiation while androgen ablation is used as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic disease. While most patients initially respond well to this hormonal therapy they most ultimately become unresponsive and recur within 2 years as androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). Recently docetaxel-based regimens have demonstrated improved survival in men with AIPC in two different large phase III studies. However the median overall survival was prolonged for only 2 or 3 months. Androgen independent (AI) progression involves variable combinations of clonal selection adaptive up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes ligand-independent androgen receptor (AR) activation alternative growth factor pathways and immune system escape. Additional therapeutic strategies targeting molecular mechanisms mediating resistance combined with immunotherapy must be developed. One strategy to improve therapies in advanced PC involves targeting genes that are activated by androgen withdrawal either to delay or prevent the emergence of the resistant AI phenotype. Recently a scientistidentified Heat Shock Protein (Hsp27) as a highly over-expressed gene in AIPC. Hsp27 knockdown using antisens oligonucleotides (ASO) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased apoptotic rates and enhanced hormone- and chemo-therapy in PC. She developed and patented a 2nd generation ASO targeting Hsp27 that has been licensed (investigational drug called OGX-427) and clinical trials phase I/II is currently in process in PC. Despite OGX-427 efficiency the functional role of stress induced Hsp27 in castration or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis remains undefined. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the pathways leading to Hsp27 action in androgen-independent prostate cancer in order to 1/ Increase the pharmacological safety of OGX-427 and 2/find new specific therapeutic targets and treatment strategy for androgen-independent prostate cancer .    ,NCT02055846

Prostate Cancer,A PHASEII STUDY EVALUATING INTRAVENOUS MELPHALAN WITH AUTOLOGOUS WHOLE BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (PBSCT)OVER THREE CYCLES IN PATIENTS WITH CASTRATION-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER (MEL-CAP)., The management of (castration-resistant) prostate cancer (CRPC) is becoming increasingly complex. The use of peripheral anti-androgens with gonadorelin analogues (maximum androgen blockade) is common place. Following the failure of such an approach several strategies may be employed. Both corticosteroids and estrogens have a role and increasingly chemotherapy is being used. The demonstration of enhanced survival using 3 weekly docetaxel has meant that this is viewed by many as the standard of care for fit patients. Melphalan is an established alkylating drug that has demonstrated some activity in CRPC but to date myelosuppression has prevented adequate dosing. We have recently conducted a phase I dose escalation study using melphalan and whole blood stem cell re-infusion and it shows that median overall survival is 22 months which is higher than the median survival rate of 19 months for Docetaxel Data from a previous phase I study has proved the successful administration of higher doses of IV Melphalan in combination with autologous blood infusion in patients with Castration-resistant prostate cancer. Rapid falls in circulating tumour cells were seen within 2 weeks of starting Melphalan however slow platelet recovery meant longer periods of platelet transfusion. For this study we intend to assess the efficacy of an intensified intravenous melphalan with autologous whole blood stem cell transplantation over three treatment cycles. 39 patients will be enrolled over a 3 year period and at least 17 patients need to survive progression free at least 6-months for this study to be considered positive. Mel-CAP is a combination chemotherapy consisting of two chemotherapy drugs: MELPHALAN and LENOGRASTIM for 3 cycles alternately.    ,NCT01907009

Prostate Cancer,Phase 1 Study to Evaluate Safety Tolerability Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of Pasireotide LAR in Patients With Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer, After failure of initial ADT addition of an anti-androgen is established to treat castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Substitution of the first anti-androgen and anti-androgen withdrawal results in treatment responses in 25-40% of patients for 4-6 months. A more effective second line treatment after failure of first ADT could prolong the time until the state of symptomatic HRPC which is currently treated with docetaxel and accompanied by significant side effects. Since the importance of the IGF-signaling in PC is not only indicated by preclinical results but also by clinical efficacy of somatostatin analogs further clinical research with the new somatostatin analog pasireotide is warranted. This study is designed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pasireotide LAR in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). It also aims for a preliminary efficacy evaluation of pasireotide within the dose expansion part at the MTD. Preliminary efficacy will be assessed by evaluation of different measures of prostate cancer e.g. changes in PSA disease control rate (RECIST 1.1) symptoms and changes of biomarkers linked to the mode of action of pasireotide LAR. The study will also explore characteristics of patients who might benefit most from this treatment approach.    ,NCT01646684

Prostate Cancer,F-choline PET in Early Response Assessment for Castration Resistant Prostatic Cancer, Until today no current diagnostic tool exists to identify an early objective response when patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated by abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. According to the Prostate Cancer Working Group the investigators have to wait 12 weeks before the first evaluation. To know soon that the treatment is effective will be decisive for the oncologist even more in palliative situation where second effects can't be imposed to patients. In post-docetaxel the F-choline PET-CT could be used to assess the response of this new therapy. Moreover the investigators suppose that we can assess an early stage if there is an objective therapeutic response at 6 weeks of treatment in order to avoid unnecessarily and expansive treatment.

Prostate Cancer,Using Ultrasound Spectrum Analysis (USA) to Guide Dose Escalated Prostate Brachytherapy, In standard treatment the seeds are placed throughout the prostate to treat the entire prostate. This is done because it was impossible to know where the cancer was located within the prostate. A new technique has been developed using the same ultrasound imaging that you probably had when you had your biopsy. Using this technique areas likely to contain prostate cancer can be identified.In this early study of 15 subjects we will test if this method to plan your prostate seed implant is safe and can be done as part of regular care. Areas identified as suspicious for cancer will be treated with higher doses of radiation while those areas not demonstrating cancer will be treated to the standard minimum dose. The higher dose areas will receive two times the minimum dose the prostate usually receives. Because this technique is not perfect those areas not identified as cancerous should be treated in case there is a cancer area that the technique did not identify. Subjects enrolled in this study will then be followed with this ultrasound technique over the next two years to monitor the changes to the cancerous areas and will undergo a biopsy two years after the procedure. Subjects will of course be monitored to assess the success of the technique and its side effects.    ,NCT01227642
Prostate Cancer,Acceptance-Based Treatment for Prostate Cancer Distress, Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common type of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death in American men. Those diagnosed with localized prostate cancer encounter three sources of psychological distress: 1) diagnosis itself 2) treatment decision making and 3) the often life-altering side effects of treatment. In addition patients who choose to undergo active surveillance which focuses on monitoring cancer in lieu of treatment experience distress related to living with cancer. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an established psychosocial intervention that has been used extensively for mental health treatment and has shown benefits for various chronic conditions. ACT is a behavioral intervention that focuses on tolerating distress and improving function. This pilot study is designed to test the feasibility of ACT for distress reduction and improved quality of life in patients recently diagnosed with early-stage localized PCa.    ,NCT01594593

The study will be conducted during two years with 60 patients. The efficacy will be assessed in terms of clinical and serological response and by specific questionnaires. This concept is based on previous reports regarding other diseases such as colon cancer where the addition of a new drug to a drug which previously had failed improved the patients' survival the quality of life and the clinical parameters. In addition preclinical data have shown activity of that regimen in prostate cancer cell lines and in animals' models. FWGE exhibits a wide variety of mode of actions in a wide range of malignant tumors. It increased the natural immune responses while decreasing the systemic inflammation often present in cancer patients. It reduced the growth of human prostate tumor xenograft in mice and prolonged their survival. It delayed disease progression increased overall survivals improve quality of life and reduce oxidative stress. The long-term goal of this research is that the addition of FWGE to a drug which previously had failed would slow down disease progression in patients with advanced and thus refractory cancers improving the patients' quality of life their clinical parameters and survival.    ,NCT00411853

Prostate Cancer,The BARCODE 2 Study - The Use of Genetic Profiling to Guide Prostate Cancer Treatment, Prostate cancer (PrCa) is one of the commonest cancer in men in the Western world with over 40000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United Kingdom (UK). Research studies have identified several genetic changes that are thought to increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. Some of these genetic changes occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes. The BARCODE 2 study is formed of two parts that aim to investigate how having genetic changes in DNA repair genes can affect response to treatment. In part 1 of the study the investigators will invite men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have not had genetic testing before to join the study by initially undergoing genetic screening within the study. If a pathogenic mutation is confirmed in one of these genes patients will be given the option to proceed to part 2 of the study. In part 2 of the study men with mCRPC who are known to be carriers of a mutation in DNA repair gene(s) will be assessed for eligibility for treatment on the study. The aim of the study will be to determine how patients with mCRPC and a germline mutation in a DNA repair gene(s) respond to platinum chemotherapy. This study will help researchers to investigate the platinum sensitivity of prostate tumours that have developed due to a germline mutation in a DNA repair gene.

Prostate Cancer,Analyze the Predictive Value of Gene TMPRSS2-ETS in Response to Enzalutamide in Patients With Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin tumor diagnosed in men and the second leading cause of cancer death in men in Western countries. Between 10-20% of patients are diagnosed at metastatic stage and about half of those diagnosed in early stages will develop metastases. After the clinical benefit of mitoxantrone and the improved survival of 2-3 months provided by docetaxel in first line the second search is driven to look for effective second lines treatments. In recent years there are new drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer revolutionizing the therapeutic sequence and survival. Thus androgen deprivation therapy treatment of choice induces an improvement of symptoms in approximately 70-80% of patients but it is limited by the development of mechanisms of resistance to androgen deficiency. Docetaxel was the first chemotherapy drug to increase survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. The second cytotoxic drug approved in the second line treatment of metastatic CRPC has been cabazitaxel. Enzalutamide improves survival in patients with metastatic CRPC who had progressed to chemotherapy and also in patients who had not received chemotherapy. To date there are no biomarkers available that allow us to identify which patients from a clinical or molecular view are those that will be able to benefit from the treatment options currently available. The presence of the TMPRSS2-ETS rearrangement has been shown to correlate with efficacy in clinical practice abiraterone. There is scientific and preclinical background that makes one suspect that the molecular alteration may influence the same way enzalutamide antiandrogen activity but it has not been determined to date. The objective of this study is to determine whether the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide when administered to patients with castration resistant prostate cancer prior to administration of docetaxel is influenced by the presence or absence of the fusion gene TMPRSS2- ETS.    ,NCT02288936

Prostate Cancer,Effect of New Posterior Reconstruction Method on Recovery of Continence After Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy, Incontinence is one of the most common complications of radical prostatectomy. The continence rate is not significantly improved even by robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). However some reports suggested that posterior reconstruction (PR) behind vesicourethral anastomosis could improve early recovery of continence during open laparoscopic or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. But recent prospective studies reported no benefit of PR after RALP which was the opposite result of those of previous studies. However the PR techniques used in these prospective studies seem to be quite different from the previous techniques. They seem to have used single-step PR which opposes the median dorsal fibrous raphe (MDFR) only to the Denonvilliers' fascia (DF). By contrast the original technique incorporated additional reconstruction between the MDFR and the posterior bladder wall 1-2 cm from the new bladder neck. Our group identified this anatomic structure as the posterior counterpart of the detrusor apron (PDA). The PDA is a strong thick functional tissue containing muscle that is more appropriate for pulling and fixing the MDFR than the DF. As such we hypothesized that the key proximal structure for PR is not DF but rather PDA. Furthermore single-step reconstruction between MDFR and PDA could be enough for PR. We previously investigated whether our new PR technique which entails opposition of the MDFR solely to the PDA would improve continence recovery compared with the standard RALP technique without PR. And our retrospective study demonstrated that this new PR technique during RALP significantly shortens the time to the recovery of continence compared with the standard technique which does not incorporate PR (Int J Urol 2012;19:683-7). Thus we plan to validate this result by a well-designed prospective randomized controlled study.    ,NCT01714219

Prostate Cancer,Evaluation of Focal Treatments of Localized Prostate Cancers With High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Using the Focal One® Device, Focal treatment of localized prostate cancer aims to destroy the cancerous foci without damaging surrounding tissues to avoid the side effects of radical treatments. This is why focal treatment is positioned as an alternative to radical surgery as well as an alternative to active surveillance. This study is a feasibility study. It aims at treating the index tumor (the most aggressive one) which determines the vital prognosis of patient while preserving the maximum surrounding prostatic tissue to preserve quality of life. The expected result is the total destruction of aggressive tumor areas by focal or multifocal treatment strategy using the Focal One® device (EDAP-TMS Vaulx-en-Velin France). The tumor destruction is validated by the negative biopsy rate between 6 and 12 months post-treatment.    ,NCT02662673
Prostate Cancer,Safety and Early Efficacy of Radical Prostatectomy for Newly Diagnosed Very High Risk Locally Advanced and Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer diagnosed among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths in the United States. In 2013 it is estimated that 29270 men have died from prostate cancer. Although radiation and surgery are quite effective for localized disease there is no effective cure for men who present with metastatic prostate cancer as the 5-year relative survival rate is only 28%. Currently androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) via medical or surgical castration is the standard first-line therapy in men with metastatic disease but castration-recurrent prostate cancer (CRPC) eventually emerges with a median time of 18-24 months. Once CRPC develops secondary hormonal manipulation chemotherapy and immunotherapy are marginally effective. Given the dismal prognosis of metastatic prostate cancer new ideas and novel approaches must be explored to improve the clinical outcome. In this regard recently emerging data suggest that local tumor control may enhance the effectiveness of subsequent systemic therapies. Therefore in this proposal the investigators have designed a Phase I/II study in which they will prospectively evaluate the safety and feasibility of cytoreductive prostatectomy in men with newly diagnosed mPCa.    ,NCT02971358

In this study the investigators seek to determine whether this dose reduction translates to improved patient outcomes. In a prospective 2-stage design up to 190 patients will be enrolled. In the first stage advanced imaging will be integrated without altering dose planning techniques. Stage 2 will reduce dose delivered to normal tissues and will collect toxicity outcome measures. This clinical trial will be conducted over 3 years.    ,NCT00890006

Prostate Cancer,Natural Killer Cells and Bortezomib to Treat Cancer, Natural killer (NK) cells are white blood cells that have a limited ability to kill cancer cells. This ability might be enhanced if they are given 24 hours after an injection of the drug bortezomib. This study will determine the following:   -  What dose of NK cells can be given safely to subjects with metastatic solid tumors or leukemia.   -  The effectiveness and side effects of NK cell therapy   -  How the body handles NK cells. People between 18 and 70 years of age who have a solid tumor or leukemia and for whom standard treatments are not effective may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures: Apheresis to collect NK cells. For this procedure a catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the subject s arm. Blood flows from the vein into a cell separator machine which separates the white cells from the other blood components. The white cells are extracted and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through a second tube placed in a vein in the other arm. Chemotherapy with the drug pentostatin to suppress the immune system and prevent it from attacking the NK cells that will be infused. Chemotherapy with bortezomib to increase NK cell function. Infusion of the NK cells. In this dose-escalating study successive groups of patients entering the study receive increasingly higher numbers of cells to determine the highest safe dose level. Up to four dose levels may be studied. Interleukin-2 drug therapy to maintain NK cell activity. Evaluations during therapy including:   -  Clinical assessment history and review of medications   -  Blood draws for routine and research tests.   -  Pharmacokinetics study after the NK infusion to see how the body handles the cells. For this test the number of NK cells in the blood are measured over time. This requires drawing about 1 teaspoon of blood at 15 minutes 30 minutes 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 hours after the infusion (day 1); then every 24 hours on days 2 through 7 then once on days 10 14 and 21.   -  Bone marrow biopsy (subjects with leukemia only).   -  Chest x-ray.   -  CT scan bone scan and PET scan if indicated for disease evaluation. Subjects who respond well after one treatment cycle may be eligible to continue NK cell therapy.    ,NCT00720785

Prostate Cancer,Patient Preference Between Cabazitaxel and Docetaxel in Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer, Taxotere is the current standard first-line chemotherapy for mCRPC and may be used as second-line therapy in good responders in first-line (Taxotere rechallenge). Jevtana has demonstrated a survival benefit versus mitoxantrone in patients progressing during or after Taxotere and is now the standard second-line chemotherapy. Taxotere and Jevtana have different toxicity profiles. Many patients who are receiving Jevtana for second-line treatment indicate they prefer this agent over Taxotere with regards to the general tolerance (namely peripheral neuropathy nail changes asthenia). This was not expected since Jevtana in post-Taxotere setting was associated with more grade 3-4 adverse events such as febrile neutropenia and diarrhea than Taxotere in first-line setting. The study design of CABA-DOC is similar to that of the PISCES trial which evaluated the patient preference between two standard treatments for first-line metastatic kidney cancer. Despite similar PFS improvements over placebo in phase III trials results clearly showed that patients preferred pazopanib over sunitinib. A randomized phase III study is currently comparing the efficacy of Taxotere and Jevtana in first-line setting with overall survival as a primary end-point. Assessing patient preference between Jevtana and Taxotere would contribute to further identify differences between these two taxanes and clarify which one of these two taxanes should be used for second-line chemotherapy and perhaps for first-line chemotherapy in the future. Assessing patient preference between the two taxanes might be less biased in the first-line setting where patients have no previous experience with a taxane.    ,NCT02044354

Prostate Cancer,Dual mTOR Inhibitor MLN0128 in Advanced Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Patients," This is a phase II study which will test the study drug MLN0128 in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer who have received chemotherapy in the past. Phase II clinical trials test how well an investigational drug works in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. MLN0128 is not approved by the FDA. The purpose of this study is to see what effects (good and bad) the study drug MLN0128 has on the patient and the cancer. MLN0128 is a drug that belongs to a class of drugs called ""mTOR kinase inhibitors"". A protein called ""mTOR"" inside the cells in the body plays a role in controlling how cells grow. In some cancer cells mTOR may be over-active. This over-activity may cause some cancer cells to grow out of control. Research has shown that mTOR inhibitors can block this overactivity and may help stop or slow down the growth of some types of cancer cells.    ",NCT02091531

Prostate Cancer,Selinexor (KPT-330) in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Prior Therapy With Abiraterone and/or Enzalutamide, Abiraterone acetate is now considered the standard of care for patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the pre-chemotherapy setting. Patients with primary or acquired abiraterone resistance typically have rapidly progressive refractory disease for which limited treatment options are available. The development of new therapies in mCRPC requires a focus on patients with primary or acquired resistance to abiraterone. Patients with abiraterone-refractory mCRPC have a poor prognosis overall with median survival after progression of disease at approximately 19 months. While chemotherapy is a standard approach in this setting it is refused by many patients and clinicians due to toxicity concerns. Selinexor is a first in class Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) that specifically blocks the karyopherin protein Exportin 1 (XPO1/Exportin 1). XPO1 is a key regulatory protein responsible for the nuclear export leading to functional inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) and is up-regulated 2-4 fold in all cancers studied to date. Selinexor given orally has demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity in animal models of prostate cancer including inhibition of PC3 driven bone metastasis.The goal of this trial is to evaluate the potential for a progression free survival benefit associated with Selinexor administration in patients with abiraterone-refractory mCRPC. Single agent phase II open label study of Selinexor in patients with mCRPC with prior therapy with standard hormone ablation agents and abiraterone.

Prostate Cancer,Androgen Ablation Therapy With or Without Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Androgen ablation therapy may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether androgen-ablation therapy is more effective with or without docetaxel in treating metastatic prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying androgen-ablation therapy and chemotherapy to see how well they work compared to androgen-ablation therapy alone in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer.    ,NCT00309985

Prostate Cancer,Risedronate to Prevent Skeletal Related Events in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Commencing Hormonal Therapy, Risedronate is an orally administered pyridinyl bisphosphonate that is 36 times more potent than pamidronate and 72 times more potent than clodronate. Four randomized double-blind trials have been carried out in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. In 2 of these studies vertebral fracture incidence was reduced by a daily dose of 5 mg risedronate by up to 65% and 49% relative to placebo after 1 and 3 years respectively. In these trials risedronate improved lumbar spine femoral neck and femoral trochanter bone mineral density (BMD) at 6 months. In addition preclinical studies have shown that risedronate is more potent than pamidronate and clodronate in inhibiting adhesion of prostate cancer cells to bone and preventing tumor cell invasion. The incidence of osteoporosis in prostate cancer patients has been well established; therefore it is advantageous to assess the efficacy of oral bisphosphonate therapy.    ,NCT00216060

Prostate Cancer,A Phase 2 Trial of Bevacizumab Lenalidomide Docetaxel and Prednisone (ART-P) for Treatment of Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  Prednisone and docetaxel have been used successfully in treating patients with prostate cancer either when used alone or in combination with other agents. Researchers believe that these anticancer effects can be increased by giving them in this specific combination.   -  A previous study at the National Cancer Institute combined docetaxel and prednisone with bevacizumab and thalidomide. The results of this study were promising; however most patients in the study required a dose reduction of thalidomide because of its side effects.   -  Lenalidomide a drug similar to thalidomide may have less severe side effects. Based on previous studies lenalidomide is well tolerated in patients with solid tumors when used alone or in combination with docetaxel and it may be a good substitute for thalidomide. Objectives:   -  To determine if lenalidomide is an appropriate and effective substitute for thalidomide in treating prostate cancer.   -  To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bevacizumab lenalidomide docetaxel and prednisone as a prostate cancer treatment and to study any side effects. Eligibility: - Men 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to standard treatment including surgical removal of the testicles or treatment with androgen (sex-hormone) suppressing drugs. Design:   -  Participants will have a complete medical history and physical examination before beginning the study.   -  Patients will be treated with 21-day cycles with a combination of four drugs:   -  (1) Docetaxel which will be given into a vein for 60 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. Patients will take dexamethasone (a steroid agent) before and after taking docetaxel.   -  (2) Prednisone which will be taken by mouth daily.   -  (3) Bevacizumab which will be given through a vein over 30 to 90 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle following the infusion of docetaxel.   -  (4) Lenalidomide which will be taken by mouth during the first 2 weeks of each 21-day cycle. The dose of lenalidomide may be adjusted if side effects develop.   -  Patients will also receive enoxaparin a subcutaneous injection administered daily to prevent blood clots and/or pegfilgrastim a subcutaneous injection on day 2 of each cycle to improve white blood cell counts as directed by researchers.    ,NCT00942578
Prostate Cancer,Docetaxel With a Phytochemical in Treating Patients With Hormone Independent Metastatic Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE : Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

Prostate Cancer,Duration of Suppression of Bone Turnover Following Treatment With Zoledronic Acid in Men With Metastatic CRPC, Bone is the most common site of metastases in prostate cancer and bone complications cause substantial morbidity to this population. Phase III studies have shown that zoledronic acid is effective in decreasing the morbidity associated with bone metastases. Zoledronic acid (ZA) is generally well tolerated but may have side effects such as hypocalcemia renal impairment and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Administration of ZA as infrequently as once yearly is sufficient to prevent osteopenia or osteoporosis. The optimal treatment interval is unknown but the drug is often empirically administered every 3-4 weeks. The cost of such treatment is high and the risk of exposing patients (especially those at low risk) to potential serious side effects with uncertain benefit warrants investigation. This study will determine the duration of suppression of bone turnover in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases following a single infusion of Zoledronic Acid and its effect on quality of life.    ,NCT01062503
Prostate Cancer,Human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Messenger RNA (hTERT mRNA) Transfected Dendritic Cell Vaccines," The purpose of this research is to develop a new and powerful type of immune therapy for prostate cancer patients. This therapy involves vaccinations with special stimulator cells found in the human body called dendritic cells. These dendritic cells can take up proteins released from cancer cells and present pieces of these proteins to immune cells called T lymphocytes to create a strong stimulatory signal to fight the cancer. One of these proteins is called telomerase which is found on prostate cancers and is critically important for prostate cancer cells to grow. However in most cancer patients the immune system does not adequately destroy the tumor because the T cells are not stimulated sufficiently. T cells require strong stimulation before they grow and become active against cancer cells. We have discovered that substances called ribonucleic acids (RNA) which carry the genetic instructions for the production of telomerase can be used to overcome this problem and stimulate a strong immune response in cancer patients. In order to test this hypothesis we have designed a clinical study and will enroll patients with metastatic prostate cancer expressing telomerase in order to determine whether or not this vaccine will stimulate T cells which can recognize and kill prostate tumor cells. The main objectives of this study are to find out whether injections with dendritic cells grown from blood cells and ""pulsed"" (mixed together for a short period of time) with RNA derived from the patient's own tumor are:   1. Safe without inducing any major side effects.   2. And effective in boosting the patient body's immunity against telomerase expressing prostate cancer cells.   3. Finally we will test whether or not tumor shrinkage based on serum PSA levels or on X-ray studies will occur. We hope that this new form of immune therapy although in its infancy will ultimately slow down tumor growth and prolong survival of prostate cancer patients.    ",NCT01153113
Prostate Cancer,Biomarkers of Bone Resorption in Metastatic Prostate Cancer, Biomarkers of bone resorption will be measured in the blood of patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer during the course of their illness.

Prostate Cancer,Abiraterone Acetate in Combination With Docetaxel After Disease Progression to Abiraterone Acetate in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer., Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of men cancer death in the United States. Hormonal therapy remains a first-line treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Initial responses to hormonal therapy with chemical or surgical castration are quite favorable however most patients will progress to a castration-resistant phase of the disease. Docetaxel is the primary chemotherapeutic option for patients with mCRPC. Abiraterone is a novel selective irreversible and potent inhibitor of 17-[alpha]-hydroxylase/1720-lyase (CYP17) enzymatic activity that has recently been demonstrated to further reduce testosterone levels in the blood to undetectable range (< 1 ng/dL) and is suggested to reduce de novo intratumor androgen synthesis. Abiraterone demonstrated activity in castration resistant prostate cancer patients previously treated with docetaxel chemotherapy. Recently results of a phase III trial comparing abiraterone plus prednisone vs placebo plus prednisone in asymptomatic and without visceral metastasis castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer patients demonstrated a better radiological progression free survival for abiraterone treated patients and a trend towards a better survival was clear for abiraterone treated patients. No clinical evidence exists about efficacy of chemotherapy and antiandrogen therapy combination. All trials have been performed in patients in which LHRH agonist treatment was continued although there is not clear evidence about efficacy of hormonal treatment. Some retrospective studies suggest that androgen deprivation treatment should be maintained in chemotherapy treated patients. Abiraterone has been proved to suppress androgen levels to negative values and to add efficacy to castration hormonal therapy. Combination of abiraterone with docetaxel chemotherapy seems promising adding efficacy to only docetaxel chemotherapy. A randomized phase II study comparing docetaxel + prednisone + abiraterone to docetaxel + prednisone in mCRPC in patients treated previously with abiraterone seems promising to explore addition of efficacy to taxotere after abiraterone hormonal treatment.    ,NCT02036060

Prostate Cancer,High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy, This pilot study initiates a research program testing the early technical and clinical performance of a novel procedure for MRI-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy. Testing will proceed in two cohorts of patients. In Arm 1 patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy will receive tumor-targeted salvage HDR brachytherapy. Arm 1 of the study will be coordinated and closely integrated with a separate concurrent study of MRI-guided prostate biopsy which will be performed prior to accrual to Arm 1 of this trial (UHN 05-0641-C). In arm 2 patients with locally advanced prostate cancer will receive a boost of prostate-targeted HDR brachytherapy during external beam radiotherapy. This technique will be prospectively evaluated in up to 100 patients. Preliminary data acquired in this pilot study will determine the technical limits of MRI guided HDR brachytherapy and will be critical for the judicious conduct of a subsequent phase II clinical trial. This proposal is innovative in two fundamental ways: MRI-guidance and specific tumor targeting for HDR brachytherapy. Successful completion of this study will further individualize local therapy not only for the benefit of the proportion of cancer patients for whom initial radiotherapeutic interventions have failed but also provide valuable technical and clinical validation that these novel image-guided (IG) approaches are clinically feasible and could be applied more broadly in prostate cancer therapy.    ,NCT00913939

Prostate Cancer,FOcal RECurrent Assessment and Salvage Treatment, Radiotherapy is the commonest form of prostate cancer treatment in the UK. In one in four men radiotherapy will fail to control the cancer. These men are offered hormonal treatment which has significant side effects. Few men are offered a further treatment such as surgery HIFU or cryotherapy. Only half of these men are cancer free at 5 years. The investigators believe this is due to poor imaging tests such as CT and Bone scan that cannot accurately detect whether cancer has come back inside or outside of the prostate or both. Also radiotherapy damages tissue surrounding the prostate which affects tissue healing for example after surgery. Treating just the cancer in the prostate only (focal treatment) rather than the whole prostate may limit this damage and cause fewer side-effects. The investigators want to see if new imaging tests can better identify cancer that has spread outside of the prostate and areas of cancer inside the prostate. Our new tests are whole-body MRI (for distant disease) and MRI guided biopsies (MRI-TB) (for local disease). First the investigators will compare the results of whole-body MRI to existing imaging tests (bone-scan and choline PET/CT) that try to find distant spread. Second the investigators will compare the results of MRI-TB to a very detailed and accurate biopsy of the prostate called template prostate mapping which will show us where and how aggressive the cancer is. Third if the cancer is confined to the prostate the investigators will treat men using focal salvage therapies HIFU and cryotherapy. The investigators believe that these new imaging tests could better identify those who will benefit from early hormone treatment and those who will benefit from local salvage treatment. Our study may help justify carrying out a larger trial looking at how good the treatment is in controlling cancer in the medium and long-term.    ,NCT01883128

Prostate Cancer,Patients Overexposed for a Prostate Adenocarcinoma, Background: Between 2000 and 2006 433 patients were overexposed (8% to 10%) during a course of conformal radiotherapy for a prostate adenocarcinoma in Jean MONNET hospital Epinal France. Among them twenty four patients received an additional mean dose about 20% due to an inappropriate use of the treatment planning system. Severe adverse events (proctitis cystitis and tissue necrosis) have occurred among most of these overexposed patients. We propose to develop several research programs in order to increase the scientific knowledge on iatrogenic effects related to overexposure of ionizing radiation by studying their relationship with dosimetric clinical biologic and genetic characteristics. Aim of the study: To correlate the received doses the volume of irradiated normal tissues the events with biologic phenotypic and genetic data.

Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy such as goserelin acetate and leuprolide acetate may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body and thus control prostate cancer growth. Many times after surgery the tumor may not need more treatment until it progresses. In this case observation may be sufficient. However in some prostate cancers there is a chance that tumors can re-grow despite surgery based on certain high risk features.    ,NCT00937768

Prostate Cancer,Evaluation of Hypoxia by PET With F-Miso in Radiation Therapy of Prostate Cancer," With functional imaging development it becomes possible to increase radiation dose to radioresistant areas (located inside tumor volume) using radiotherapy dose-painting. This strategy is particularly suitable for prostate cancer where tumor hypoxia plays a major role in the resistance of these tumors to radiation. In order to develop intratumoral hypoxia targeting by radiotherapy dose-painting areas we should characterize changes in hypoxia before treatment and during radiotherapy.   -  If hypoxia does not change during radiotherapy radiotherapy dose-painting strategy by an ""integrated"" boost is performed.   -  If hypoxia varied (increasing or incomplete regression) a ""final"" boost strategy of radiotherapy dose-painting(IMRT stereotactic brachytherapy or high dose rate) after a first fractionated IMRT could be considered. This study should show that PET imaging with fluoromisonidazole (18F-MISO) is an available tool to physicians in assessing tumor hypoxia.    ",NCT01898065
Prostate Cancer,CyberKnife® as Monotherapy or Boost SBRT for Intermediate or High Risk Localized Prostate Cancer, The primary objective of this study is to document the effectiveness of Cyberknife stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in the treatment of intermediate and high-risk localized prostate cancer defined by biochemical Disease-Free Survival (bDFS) using Phoenix and American Society of Therapeutic Radiation and Oncology (ASTRO) definitions at 5 years. During the prostate-specific antigen era an ever-increasing percentage of men with prostate cancer have presented with clinically localized potentially curable disease. Although conventional treatment options are potentially curative in selected patients these treatments also have drawbacks including the risk of negative long-term quality of life consequences and serious complications. The CyberKnife® system is a type of radiation machine that uses a special system to precisely focus large doses of x-rays on the tumor. The device is designed to concentrate large doses of radiation onto the tumor so that injury from radiation to the nearby normal tissue will be minimal. Intermediate risk patients will be treated with either CyberKnife® Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) monotherapy or CyberKnife® SBRT boost followed by Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). High risk patients will be treated with CyberKnife® SBRT boost followed by IMRT. Treatment will last 4-7 days. Patients will complete the QOL questionnaires before treatment. Questionnaires will also be completed during follow-up visits at 1 3  6 12 18 24 30 and 36 months then every 12 months until year 5.    ,NCT01985828
Prostate Cancer,Two StereoTactic Ablative Adaptive Radiotherapy Treatments for Localized Prostate Cancer," You have been asked to consider participating in the study because you have a cancer of the prostate which is to be treated with external beam radiation. You have chosen or felt not to be a good candidate for just watching your cancer. As your doctor has informed you this involves delivering small amounts of radiation daily over several weeks. Normally a small field directed to the prostate gland is given for 7.5 - 8 weeks. In total 39 days of radiation are delivered. There is now growing evidence that prostate cancer cells may be killed more effectively if higher doses of radiation are delivered everyday (known as hypofractionation). However the downside to such a strategy is the potential to cause more side effects because normal organs (such as the rectum and bladder) are also exposed to the higher doses. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a high-precision technique which has the ability to deliver radiation in a more focused manor meaning that the radiation dose can be ""sculpted"" to the prostate gland while minimizing the amount of radiation to the bladder and rectum. A certain amount of movement of the prostate normally occurs within the body. To make sure that the prostate will not be missed a margin of tissue around the prostate also needs to be treated. Although a wide margin will ensure that the prostate is included it will also cause more normal tissue to receive high doses of radiation. This in turn would result in more side effects. To reduce the margin needed around the prostate and side effects tiny gold seeds measuring 3.0 x 1.2mm will be inserted into the prostate which can be seen using a special type of X-Ray camera called a portal imager during treatment. This will allow for targeting of the prostate gland more precisely so that a significantly smaller margin of normal tissue will need to be treated. By using gold seeds in conjunction with SABR there is the potential to safely deliver a more intensive dose of radiation to the prostate gland without increasing the amount of side effects. In other studies where shorter and more intense courses of radiation have been given using similar high-precision techniques the side effects of treatment have indeed been no worse than the usual techniques. Over the last 7 years Sunnybrook researchers have treated over three hundred prostate cancer patients on various research protocols with SABR. In those protocols patients received 5 SBRT treatments over 29 days and this is currently being compared to 5 SBRT treatments over 11 days in an ongoing randomized study. In the United States several groups have investigated the 5 SBRT approach in 11 days or less and early findings suggest a good tolerance. The study is being done to determine the side effects quality of life and efficacy of 2-fraction adaptive SBRT technique (2STAR) in the treatment of low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. All participants will receive the same dose and fractionation scheme.    ",NCT02031328

Prostate Cancer,Copper Cu 64 TP3805 PET in Detecting Cancer in Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery, This pilot phase I trial studies copper Cu 64 TP3805 (Cu-64-TP3805) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in detecting cancer in patients with prostate cancer undergoing surgery to remove the entire prostate and some of the tissue around it (radical prostatectomy). Many patients with benign lesions must undergo biopsy to test the lesion. Cu-64-TP3805 is a radioactive substance that attaches to cancer cells but not normal cells. PET/CT uses a scanner to make detailed computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the radioactive substance is lighting up. Using Cu-64-TP3805 PET/CT scans and comparing them with cancer tissue obtained from surgery may help doctors learn whether Cu-64-TP3805 PET/CT can accurately detect prostate lesions and determine whether they are cancerous or benign which may minimize the need for prostate biopsies.    ,NCT02603965

PET/MRI scans take both PET and MRI images at the same time and combine them into a single picture and is used to describe information regarding the function as well as location and size of a tumor. 68Ga-RM2 a compound made of a radioactive agent linked to a pharmacological substance that is strongly attracted by a substance made by tumor cells to detect prostate cancer. 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI may be able to see smaller tumors than the standard of care contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan    ,NCT02624518
Prostate Cancer,68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in Detecting Prostate Cancer Recurrence in Patients With Elevated PSA After Initial Treatment, This trial studies how well gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA ligand Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC (68Ga-PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in detecting prostate cancer that may have come back in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after initial treatment. A rise in blood level of PSA a protein made by the prostate after treatment with surgery or radiation in patients without symptoms indicates that the cancer may have come back (recurrence). PSA however cannot determine whether the disease is located only in the prostate or other places in the body. 68Ga-PSMA is a radioactive tracer that targets and specifically binds to tumor cells expressing PSA making them lighting up. PET and CT make computerizing pictures of areas inside the body where the radioactive substance is lighting up. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT may be able to see smaller tumors than standard imaging and may help determine whether prostate cancer has come back and where it is in the body.    ,NCT02673151

Prostate Cancer,Genetic Analysis of Hereditary Prostate Cancer, Molecular approaches to the understanding of human neoplastic disease have revealed that multiple genetic alterations are an essential component of tumorigenesis. Both germline and somatic genetic alterations can be involved in the malignant transformation of normal cells. Identification of the genes involved in neoplastic transformation has been approached through the molecular analysis of sporadic cancers and the genetic study of families with an inherited predisposition for cancer. The interplay of these two approaches has led to the characterization of genes such as the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene the p53 gene and the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene that are all involved in the development of both hereditary and non-hereditary forms of cancer. Inherited mutations in such genes predispose affected families to hereditary cancer syndromes affording an opportunity to identify genetic lesions that also cause the more common sporadic cancers. Prostate cancer (PRCA) is the most common cancer diagnosed (1999 estimate 179300 cases) and the second leading cause of cancer mortality (1999 estimate 37000 deaths) in men in the United States. Family history is the single strongest risk factor currently known for prostate cancer. This raises the possibility that heritable genetic factors may be involved in the development of this disease in a subset of men. The genetic contribution to diseases of complex origin such as cancer is often most salient in families of early onset cases. Therefore prostate cancer inheritance following a simple Mendelian pattern may be identified in the families of probands with early-onset cases. Common susceptibility alleles of small effect may be detectable in families with later-onsent and/or less strong family history of PRCA or in case-control data.    ,NCT00001469

Patients 18 years or older with testosterone-dependent prostate cancer that has persisted or recurred after having had surgery radiation therapy or cryosurgery but whose disease has not metastasized (spread beyond the prostate) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination including blood tests bone and computed tomography (CT) scans or other imaging studies. Study participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group receives leuprolide or goserelin followed by thalidomide; the other receives leuprolide or goserelin followed by placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredients). Patients in both groups receive an injection of leuprolide or goserelin once a month for 6 months. After that time they take four capsules of either thalidomide or placebo once a day and remain on the drug until their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level returns to what it was before beginning leuprolide or goserelin or to 5 nanograms per liter whichever is lower.(PSA is a protein secreted by the prostate gland. Monitoring changes in levels of this protein can help evaluate tumor progression). At this point the entire procedure begins again starting with leuprolide or goserelin treatment but the experimental drug is switched; patients originally treated with thalidomide are crossed over to placebo and patients originally treated with placebo are crossed over to thalidomide. Patients are monitored periodically with the following tests and procedures: Medical histories and physical examinations. Blood and urine tests to monitor thalidomide and PSA levels the response to treatment and routine laboratory values (e.g. cell counts and kidney and liver function). Computed tomography (CT) and bone scans and possibly other imaging tests to assess the tumor. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies as needed.

Prostate Cancer,PSA-Based Vaccine and Radiotherapy to Treat Localized Prostate Cancer, This study will test the ability of an experimental vaccine to increase the number of tumor-fighting immune cells (lymphocytes) in patients with localized prostate cancer and prevent the disease from recurring following radiation therapy. The vaccine is intended to stimulate lymphocytes to target and attack cells containing a protein called prostate specific antigen or PSA. It is composed of the following parts:   -  rV-PSA: Vaccinia virus plus human DNA that produces PSA (prostate specific antigen)   -  rV-B7.1: Vaccinia virus plus human DNA that produces B7.1 (a protein that helps guide immune cells to their targets)   -  rF-PSA: Fowlpox virus plus human DNA that produces PSA   -  GM-CSF: Drug that boosts the immune system.   -  IL-2: Drug that boosts the immune system. Patients 18 years of age and older with prostate cancer confined to the prostate who have received a smallpox vaccine sometime in the past and who do not have a history of allergy to eggs may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a complete medical history and physical examination blood tests and skin tests (similar to those for allergies or tuberculosis) to assess immune function. Participants are randomly assigned to receive one of the following three treatments: Group 1 - standard radiation therapy plus the experimental vaccine; Group 2 - standard radiation therapy without the vaccine; Group 3 - standard radiation therapy with the vaccine but with a different dose of IL-2 from Group 1. Patients in the vaccine groups receive injections in the arm or thigh in 28-day treatment cycles as follows:   -  GM-CSF: Days 1 through 4 of the first week   -  IL-2 5: for Group 1 5 days in the second week of each cycle; for Group 3 14 days beginning in the second week of each cycle   -  rV-PSA and rV-B7.1: Day 2 of the first cycle only   -  rF-PSA (booster shots): Every 28 days beginning day 2 of the second cycle (i.e. days 30 58 86 etc.) Treatment continues for eight cycles unless serious side effects develop PSA levels rise significantly or the doctors feel there is no reason to continue therapy. All patients undergo radiation therapy and possibly hormone therapy if indicated. Blood samples are drawn once a week for the first month and then once every 4 weeks to monitor safety. After treatment ends patients are followed with examinations and blood tests every 3 months for the first 2 years and then every 6 months until the doctors determine follow-up is no longer needed or the cancer returns. All patients have HLA tissue typing at the beginning of the study. Those who are type HLA-A2 are asked to have additional procedures for studying the immune response that can be done only with this tissue type. This involves collecting blood samples before treatment begins every 4 weeks during treatment once after cycle 2 and once 4 months after the eighth vaccine. They also undergo four leukapheresis procedures for collecting white blood cells. For leukapheresis blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein similar to donating a unit of blood. The blood flows through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are removed and the red cells platelets and plasma are returned to the body either through the same needle or through a needle in the other arm.    ,NCT00005916

Prostate Cancer,A Safety and Feasibility Study of Active Immunotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Carcinoma Using Autologous Dendritic Cells Pulsed With Antigen Encoded in Amplified Autologous Tumor RNA, Purpose: This protocol proposes a safety and feasibility trial in patients with metastatic prostate cancer (stages D1-D3) investigating the induction of antitumor immunity by administration of cultured autologous peripheral blood precursor derived dendritic cells (DC) transfected with mRNA amplified from autologous prostate tumor tissue. The feasibility and dose-limiting toxicity of administering escalating doses of tumor RNA transfected dendritic cells will be defined. As a secondary endpoint the ability of tumor RNA transfected dendritic cells to induce tumor-specific immune responses will be evaluated. Finally the anti-tumor effect based on PSA (biochemical) response criteria will be defined. Background: Because prostate cancer is incurable when metastatic and conventional therapies do not offer a clear survival benefit new therapeutic strategies are warranted. This study is based on the premise that clinically effective cell mediated immune responses against prostate tumors can be elicited by activation of tumor associated antigen specific T cells. Work performed by others and our group suggests that PSA a protein expressed in virtually all prostate cancers can serve as a widely expressed candidate antigen for prostate cancer immunotherapy. In particular we have shown that cultured dendritic cells transfected with mRNA encoding PSA are remarkably effective in stimulating antigen specific immunity in vitro. Therefore we hypothesize that administration of PSA RNA transfected DC will lead to detectable levels of PSA specific CTL in the peripheral blood of patients with PSA expressing metastatic prostate cancer. It is hoped that these T cell responses also have clinical antitumor activity.    ,NCT00006430
Prostate Cancer,Study of Prostate Cancer in Black and White U.S. Veterans, Prostate cancer is diagnosed in approximately 334500 men each year and accounts for nearly 41800 deaths in the United States. Prostate cancer is the leading cancer affecting veterans and the second leading cancer among all Americans. The causes of prostate cancer and particularly the reasons for the unusually high incidence rates in African-Americans remain obscure. Dietary factors likely play a role in fatal cases while hormones are also important in regulating prostate cancer growth. Dr. Charles Huggins recognized this effect in the 1940?s with androgen deprivation remaining as the cornerstone of therapy for advanced disease. Despite the strong circumstantial evidence neither epidemiologic studies nor basic sciences have produced clear insight into the etiologic role of hormones. However recent observations regarding androgen receptor gene polymorphisms and their relation to endocrine expression and prostate cancer risk may be providing important clues as to how an etiologic role might be mediated at the molecular level. Thus it is important to attempt to identify genetic markers of high-risk cancer patients for necessary screening and counseling efforts.    ,NCT00007540
Prostate Cancer,To Explore Racial Differences in Potential Risk Factors for Developing Prostate Cancer in the VA Population., Primary Objectives: To explore racial differences in potential risk factors for developing prostate cancer in the VA population and to compare and contrast the results of this study with that of an ongoing NCI-funded study in North Carolina. Secondary Objectives: To investigate familial aggregation of prostate cancer in blacks and whites. To determine whether screening behavior differs in men diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer versus those with later stage disease as well as to determine if screening behavior differences exist between blacks and whites. Primary Outcomes: The primary outcomes are pesticide occupational and chemical exposure and dietary history. Other major endpoints include: 1) familial aggregation of prostate cancer; 2) weight weight history and weight cycling; 3) subject's knowledge attitudes and behaviors about prostate cancer; and 4) treatment choices. Intervention: N/A Study Abstract: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American men. Among African Americans the incidence and mortality from prostate cancer is even greater. Although incidence rates in the Southern United States tend to be only slightly higher than that of the nation a clear discrepancy exists between national mortality rates and those in the Southeastern United States. Notably high rates particularly among African Americans are observed and in North Carolina the prostate cancer mortality rate among African Americans is the highest of any state in the nation. In spite of these statistics very little is known about racially based differences in the etiology of this disease. This study hypothesizes that racial differences in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer may be a result of multiple factors including those that are socioeconomic environmental dietary and genetic. This research will provide insight into gene-environmental interactions that initiate and promote prostatic neoplasia as well as address whether there are differences in patterns of care which impact morbidity and survival. The results of this study will also be compared to findings in non-veterans that are being generated through an NCI-funded sister study of these issues under the direction of co-investigator Dr. JoEllen Schildkraut of Duke University. Subjects were identified from pathology reports extracted from VISTA. Additionally subjects were identified by reviewing radiation/oncology clinic records for those subjects referred for radiation treatment. Subject enrollment concluded with 100 cases and 98 controls enrolled in the study    ,NCT00007579
Prostate Cancer,Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT), Radical prostatectomy provides potentially curative removal of the cancer. However it subjects patients to the morbidity and mortality of the surgery and may be neither necessary nor effective. Expectant management does not offer potential cure. However it provides palliative therapy for symptomatic or metastatic disease progression avoids potentially excessive and morbid interventions in asymptomatic patients and emphasizes management approaches for focus on relieving symptoms while minimizing therapeutic complications. The primary objective of this study is to determine which of two strategies is superior for the management of clinically localized CAP: 1) radical prostatectomy with early aggressive intervention for disease persistence or recurrence 2) expectant management with reservation of therapy for palliative treatment of symptomatic or metastatic disease progression. Outcomes include total mortality CAP mortality disease free and progression free survival morbidity quality of life and cost effectiveness.    ,NCT00007644

Prostate Cancer,Magnetic Resonance-Guided High-Dose Brachytherapy (Short-Range Radiation Therapy) for Prostate Cancer, This study will evaluate the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for guiding placement of hollow needles into the prostate gland for delivering internal radiation therapy to patients with prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is often treated with a combination of external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy (internal radiation delivered close to the tumor). This study will determine whether MRI is more accurate in guiding needle placement than ultrasound which is currently used for this purpose. Patients will have one brachytherapy treatment followed by 5 weeks of external beam treatments and a second brachytherapy. Patients 18 years of age and older with prostate cancer that has not spread to the bone may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination blood and urine tests and a bone scan. To plan for radiation therapy patients will have standard computed tomography (CT) and MRI scans of the pelvis and prostate. In addition CT and MRI scans will be done to determine if the prostate is in a good position for brachytherapy. For these scans patients will have an enema and a tube will be placed in the rectum. They will then lie still on their side for about 45 minutes during the scan. Patients who have blood in their urine will also undergo cystoscopy. This is an examination of the bladder using a small camera that is advanced through the penis into the bladder. Patients are given an antibiotic for 2 days before the brachytherapy and on the morning of the procedure. Before the test they have a small enema and are given medicines through the vein and into the spine for relaxation and to decrease any discomfort. (The test is done under general anesthesia for patients who require it.) The patient is moved on a stretcher into the MRI scanner and a catheter is inserted into the bladder through the penis. The bladder is filled with water and a tube is placed in the rectum. With the help of a plastic guide placed against the skin about 14 to 18 needles are then placed in the prostate. Some stitches are sewn to hold the needles and the guide in place and the tube in the rectum is removed. The patient is the transferred from the MR scanner into the CT scanner where the rectal tube is reinserted and the needles are adjusted. A cystoscopy is done to make sure the needles do not enter the bladder. When the needles are adjusted the tube is removed from the rectum and the patient is moved to the radiation oncology clinic. After a few hours when the radiation dose has been calculated a radioactive substance called iridium is administered. The needles placed in the prostate are connected to a radiation machine and thin wires with radioactive material on the tips are inserted into each needle and withdrawn a little at a time. The process takes about 20 to 30 minutes. The patient is then disconnected from the machine and undergoes another MRI scan to confirm the position of the needles. The needles and catheter are then removed and the patient is monitored for a while before going home. Patients then have 5 weeks of external beam therapy followed by a second brachytherapy treatment. Patients return to the clinic at 1 3 6 12 18 24 36 48 and 60 months after treatment for blood tests physical examination and review of symptoms.    ,NCT00039624

Prostate Cancer,Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Locate and Characterize Prostate Cancer, This study will examine the usefulness of an imaging procedure called dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for localizing and characterizing prostate cancer. For this test a medicine is injected into a vein and the MRI measures how the medicine flows through the prostate gland. The measurements provide information about the blood vessels in the prostate gland which provides other information about the cancer. Several needle biopsies are performed during the procedure and the results of the biopsies are compared with the information from the DCE-MRI. Men 18 years of age and older with suspected or confirmed prostate cancer may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination blood test and review of tumor pathology. Participants undergo DCE-MRI and needle biopsies of the prostate. The day before and the morning of the procedure patients are given an antibiotic called Levofloxacin. They also have a small enema the morning of the test. A local anesthetic is then given in the area around the prostate to numb the tissue and decrease any discomfort from the procedure. A tube is placed in the rectum to obtain better pictures of the prostate gland during the imaging. During the scan the patient may be asked to breathe air that contains higher concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide than are in room air. The MRI scans guide the physician in selecting areas of the prostate to biopsy. For each biopsy a needle is placed through the rectum into the prostate gland. When the needle is in place a small tissue sample is withdrawn. This procedure is repeated until 4 to 10 biopsies are taken. During the procedure which lasts about 1 hour the patient lies on his stomach on a stretcher. Patients who are planning to undergo surgery or radiation treatment for their cancer at the NCI may have up to four 1-mm non-reactive gold markers placed in the prostate during the DCE-MRI procedure. The markers are left in place to help target the radiation treatments and to show where the biopsies were taken if the prostate is removed. At the end of the procedure the patient is moved to a bed to recover and may get up and urinate after about 30 to 60 minutes. After a period of observation the patient is discharged home with a dose of antibiotic to take the next day. Some patients may be asked to repeat the MRI and biopsy procedure during or after their treatment for prostate cancer to help investigators learn whether the MRI test is still helpful after treatment. Repeat testing is optional.    ,NCT00082147

Prostate Cancer,GVAX in Advanced Prostate Cancer Patients Made Lymphopenic, Androgen (a male sex hormone) deprivation is the standard therapy for metastatic prostate cancer and results in regression or control of disease in 80-85% of patients. This hormone therapy results in a progression-free survival of 12-18 months and overall survival of 24-30 months. However all patients ultimately develop hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). Management of HRPC patients is a significant challenge for both patient and physician. Neither past nor current chemotherapy regimens have shown curative potential in patients with HRPC. Thus new treatment strategies are a high priority. A major focus of new treatment strategies is to enlist the aid of the immune system particularly the development of prostate cancer vaccines. There has been a number of studies using dendritic cell based vaccines and the treatment has been well tolerated. Specific T-cell immune responses have been observed and occasional evidence for tumor regression. A reduction in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been observed as well. Lengthening the time-to-progression and delays in the onset of bone pain have been observed in subsets of patients with HRPC. The initial preclinical observations suggesting that a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene transduced allogeneic (GVAX) prostate cancer vaccine may be efficacious in poorly immunogenic cancers were reported. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunologic effects of vaccinations with Allogeneic Prostate GVAX® (CG1940 & CG8711) in patients made lymphopenic by treatment with chemotherapy and infused with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Clinical observations and laboratory measurements will be monitored to evaluate safety toxicity and immune responses. Additionally the effects of treatment on serum PSA levels and tumor response will be evaluated.    ,NCT00122005
Prostate Cancer,Biological Imaging for Optimising Clinical Target Volume (CTV) and Gross Tumour Volume (GTV) Contouring in Prostate Cancer to Improve the Possibilities for Intensity Modulated RadioTherapy (IMRT) Dose Escalation, The clinical outcome after external beam irradiation for prostate cancer is disappointing in the advanced tumor stages. There are indications that an increase in radiation dose to the tumor will improve outcome significantly especially to the biologically active tumour parts within the cancer area. Until recently no imaging equipment was available to define both the anatomic and biologically active tumor parts. Now at the Center for Biological Imaging and Adaptive Radiotherapy equipment is at hand that will be able to visualise the areas mentioned above. When combining the data of these imaging modalities it might be possible to create an optimised irradiation plan. This study is a planning study in which on 15 patients the different anatomical and biological imaging data per patient will be evaluated matched and finally a theoretical improved irradiation treatment plan will be made. This research complies with the current opinion on radiation development. Progress in functional imaging is likely to provide the tools required for individualised risk-adapted radiotherapy.    ,NCT00122252
Prostate Cancer,Exploring Genomic Proteomic and Dosimetric Determinants of Late Toxicity After Three Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy (RT) for Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in males and radiotherapy is a commonly chosen treatment option for patients with localized disease. Technical innovations such as three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy permit radiation dose escalation and possibly better disease outcomes but escalated doses may be accompanied by long-term complications. This study will examine for the first time the independent contribution of a patient's own genetic makeup to the development of post-radiation complications permitting the future development of predictive tests to avoid radiation injury. To do this the investigators will examine gene markers and blood proteins in a series of approximately 100 prostate cancer survivors who have received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy between 1996 and 2000 at the Cross Cancer Institute.    ,NCT00122265

Prostate Cancer,Study to Determine the Prevalence of Osteoporosis in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer Treated With Hormonal Manipulation, Osteoporosis or thinning of the bones is a common disorder which can cause significant morbidity in terms of pain and fracture. One of the causes of osteoporosis is a low or absent testosterone level. Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy in males with an increasing incidence. The mainstay of advanced prostate cancer treatment is hormonal manipulation (surgery or medications) in order to lower testosterone levels as testosterone stimulates cancer cells. Despite the known links both between osteoporosis low testosterone and prostate cancer little data is available on how common osteoporosis is among men with advanced prostate cancer treated with hormonal manipulation. Since prostate cancer affects so many men and the indications for early hormonal manipulation are expanding it is important to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis in these males.    ,NCT00124410

Prostate Cancer,Phase I Study of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer, BACKGROUND: -This study represents a progression from findings in four previous NCI ROB protocols (02-C-0167A 02-C-0207E 03-C-0190B 04-C-0171). In these previous works we have begun to develop techniques to obtain MR biological images and co-register tissue in prostate cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: -The scientific objective of this protocol is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of external beam radiation to regions of interest within the prostate based acute toxicity. Secondary objectives of this study are to relate patterns in gene and protein expression to response and toxicity and to evaluate the frequency of late term toxicity. ELIGIBILITY: -Patients with prostate cancer without evidence of metastasis will be eligible for this study. DESIGN:   -  This phase I trial will use intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to deliver escalating doses of external beam radiation to regions of histologically confirmed prostate cancer. The study will be conducted using a standard 3-6 dose-escalation with an initial 3 patients in each dose cohort and the potential expansion of the cohort to 6 patients.   -  Anatomic MRI and MR biological images such as MRS will be obtained Tissue will be acquired from sites of interest with biopsy locations precisely translated (co-registered) to an MR image of reference. Tissue samples will be processed for cDNA microarray testing and stored for future analysis in the Radiation Oncology Branch NCI. A gold seed will be left at the biopsy site as a fiducial marker to direct future radiation therapy. If necessary additional fiducial markers will be placed for target localization during treatment.   -  Once MR guided biopsies are obtained and fiducial markers placed the patient will undergo a standard CT simulation for radiation therapy treatment planning. The MR and CT images will be fused. Areas of pathologically confirmed malignancy will undergo dose escalation as described below. Areas of image abnormality that could not be biopsied or were without definite pathologic evidence of malignancy will be given intermediate doses. The remainder of the prostate gland will receive standard dose (7560 cGy.)   -  The trial will accrue 18 to 36 patients with an anticipated accrual period of 2 years.    ,NCT00124917

Prostate Cancer,Improving Assessment (and Ultimately Outcomes) of Permanent Prostate Implant Therapy," Permanent prostate implants are a type of radiation therapy in which a high dose of radiation is delivered to cancerous tissue by many small radioactive ""seeds"". Studies of early-stage prostate cancer patients treated in this way and followed for 10 - 12 years indicate a cure rate of about 80%. This result is similar to surgery and other forms of radiotherapy but comes with fewer side effects and greater convenience for the patient. Further studies show that the radiation dose delivered is the most important factor in achieving a cure. At present this dose is estimated by a computer using a computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient and a simple calculation method. The dose estimate is not as accurate as it could be however because the precise extent of the prostate is hard to determine from the CT scan and the calculation method does not make use of information about patient body tissues. The researchers propose to eliminate these inaccuracies by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify the prostate gland and by developing an improved dose calculation algorithm that includes information about patient tissues. This new approach will allow physicians to assess implant quality with greater certainty improve their implant technique and ultimately increase the cure rate to as much as 95%.    ",NCT00127816

Prostate Cancer,Hypofractionated Radiotherapy (55 Gy/16 Fractions/4 Weeks) for Localized Prostate Cancer, Many patients with localized prostate cancer choose radiotherapy for treatment. Recent improvements in technology have lead to better outcomes with less side effects and better disease control rates by allowing high doses of radiation to be delivered to the cancer with lower doses to surrounding healthy tissues. Currently patients are required to attend daily treatments over seven to eight weeks which can be costly and disruptive for patients especially those not living close to a cancer centre. There is recent research that suggests that the same or better outcomes might be achieved in prostate cancer by delivering a smaller number of treatments but with a higher dose of radiation given on each visit over a shorter time than the usual seven to eight weeks. In this study the investigators propose to treat patients with prostate cancer using 16 treatments over four weeks thus reducing the number of visits to the cancer centre for treatment by 50%.    ,NCT00129025
Prostate Cancer,Toremifene Citrate for Prevention of Bone Fractures in Men With Prostate Cancer on Androgen Deprivation Therapy, Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) treatment for prostate cancer decreases the natural hormone called testosterone.

Prostate Cancer,Estramustine Etoposide and Paclitaxel Treatment for Hormonally Responsive Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, Hormonal therapy is the standard treatment for prostate cancer which has spread to other areas of the body. Despite the high initial response rates to hormonal therapy the vast majority of men will develop cancer which is no longer responsive to hormone deprivation. The average time for hormonal therapy to be effective is about 18 months. Chemotherapy combinations which can treat the disease when it no longer responds to hormonal therapy have been developed but these treatments are not curative. One of these combinations is estramustine etoposide and paclitaxel. In men with far advanced disease 60% will have a decrease in their PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) or shrinkage of tumors after treatment with this chemotherapy. Despite this these men have all developed further disease progression requiring additional treatment. One possible way to make chemotherapy more effective is to give it when the number of tumor cells is smallest and the number of cells to be killed is at a low level. One situation in which this is true is when a man has responded to hormonal therapy any tumors are at their smallest size. This study will test whether the addition of chemotherapy at that time will prolong the time until the cancer becomes unresponsive to hormonal therapy.    ,NCT00151060

Prostate Cancer,Assessment of Primary Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer Among Elderly, The widespread availability of screening coupled with high risks of over diagnosis over treatment and a rising risk of dying from competing causes of deaths pose a major challenge for prostate cancer patients and our health care system. Data on outcomes and identification of patients who are likely to benefit from therapies are urgently needed to empower patients and health professionals and to allocate limited health resources wisely. The long-term goal of this population-based study is to improve prostate cancer care for elderly patients. In 2004 approximately thirty percent of the 230110 new prostate cancer cases diagnosed will be in men over age 75. Elderly men have a high risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer but a relatively low risk of dying of this disease and are often excluded from cancer trials. While the value of primary androgen deprivation for localized prostate cancer remains questionable this treatment is widely used among elderly patients. Currently there is insufficient outcomes data to guide treatment choices for elderly patients.The following are the key background considerations that provide the rationale for this proposed project:· Prostate cancer is prevalent among elderly men. · Over diagnosis and competing causes of death are important issues for elderly men with prostate cancer.· Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is being increasingly used as primary therapy among elderly patients with localized disease· There are insufficient outcomes data to support the use of primary androgen deprivation for non metastatic prostate cancer· Preliminary dataThe study population in this sub-project is a sub-sample of the large study (IRB # 5177 ) and the research methods are identical in both studies.    ,NCT00161252

Prostate Cancer,Long Acting LHRH Versus Short Acting LHRH in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer, Brachytherapy or Transperineal implantation of the prostate (TPIP) is a recognized form of treatment for localized cancer of the prostate. TPIP has been used at the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) since 1998. As part of the treatment some patients also require hormone therapy for 6 months. This is given as injections of a drug called an LHRH agonist. The LHRH agonist is made either as short-acting (1-month) or long-acting (3 month) injections. The LHRH agonist lowers testosterone levels which helps make delivery of TPIP easier and more effective. There are specific guidelines regarding the use of LHRH agonist treatment with brachytherapy however there is no policy whether short-acting or long-acting LHRH agonists should be used. Analysis of results from BC has shown that there seems to be a delay in the time in which testosterone levels return to normal in men who receive the long-acting LHRH agonist compared with the short-acting LHRH agonist however this is not known for sure.    ,NCT00175383
Prostate Cancer,Androgen Suppression Combined With Elective Nodal and Dose Escalated Radiation Therapy," The purpose of this trial is to compare two similar treatments for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. The two treatment arms being compared are: (Standard Arm) hormone therapy which will prevent the production of the male hormone testosterone by the testicles and pelvic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) followed by a high-dose conformal EBRT boost versus (Investigational Arm) hormone therapy and pelvic EBRT followed by a brachytherapy boost (implantation of radioactive iodine sources or ""seeds"" into the prostate). The hypothesis of this trial is that more patients may experience 5 year actuarial freedom from biochemical recurrence of their prostate cancer following treatment with the investigational arm. Biochemical failure is declared on the date when the post treatment prostate specific antigen (PSA) is > 2 ng/mL above the lowest level previously recorded.    ",NCT00175396
Prostate Cancer,Randomized Phase II Trial of Doxil With or Without Dexamethasone for Metastatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer, The primary objective of this study is to assess disease response to Doxil in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer with or without dexamethasone pre-treatment. Study Design: We will perform an open labeled parallel randomized phase II study using a two-stage design to determine if there is sufficient anti-tumor activity in either arm to warrant further study. Assumptions made in this study: an unacceptable overall response rate is </= 10% & we will pursue further study if the overall response rate is >/= 30%. Fifteen patients will be randomized in the first phase (to both Arm 1 and Arm 2). No further patients will be accrued if <2/15 responses are noted in a given arm. Ten additional patients will be enrolled if >/= 2/15 responses are observed. If there are >/= 5/25 responses then further studies will be pursued with that regimen. We will determine the overall incidence & severity of toxicities in both arms. Treatment: Arm 1: Doxil: Dose: 50 mg/m2 IV (in the vein) on day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 2: Doxil: Dose: 50 mg/m2 IV (in the vein) on day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 1 only: Dexamethasone: Dose: 12 mg twice a day by mouth on days 1 2 3 4 5 of each 28 day cycle.

Prostate Cancer,Prostate Cancer Screening: Fostering Informed Decisions, The primary goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a print-based method of patient education with a decision tool that is designed to provide detailed information about prostate cancer and to clarify patient preferences and values ultimately assisting men in making an informed screening decision.    ,NCT00196807
Prostate Cancer,Angelica Sinensis for the Treatment of Hot Flashes in Men Undergoing LHRH Therapy for Prostate Cancer, Men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer may experience significant side effects including symptoms of intense heat facial flushing and sweating. These so-called hot flashes are similar to those experienced by women during menopause. A traditional Chinese herbal preparation Dong Quai has been used for thousands of years to reduce the incidence and severity of hot flashes. Anecdotal evidence exists to support the use of Dong Quai in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Recently the awareness and use of herbal remedies and over-the-counter preparations for a number of different conditions have increased dramatically. This trial was therefore designed to determine if Dong Quai significantly reduces the incidence and severity of hot flashes in men following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.    ,NCT00199485

Prostate Cancer,A Randomized Study of the Efficacy of Low Venous Pressure General Anesthesia Versus Combined Spinal-Epidural Anesthesia in Decreasing Blood Loss During Prostate Surgery, You are being asked to join the study because you have early stage prostate cancer and will have your prostate removed. The purpose of this study is to compare blood loss during surgery among two types of anesthesia. One type is general anesthesia. It puts you in a deep enough sleep that you will not feel anything. It also keeps your blood pressure low which might decrease bleeding. The second type is combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. For this type a small catheter is placed in your spinal canal through your back. Anesthesia given through the catheter makes your body numb from the waist down so the sleep you would be in is not so deep. Your blood pressure would remain in your normal range. After surgery the catheter remains in place to treat your pain but your body would not be numb. When you wake up after general anesthesia you would receive pain medicine through a vein in your arm. Both types are used at Memorial Hospital. They are accepted forms of anesthesia. We will be looking at blood loss between these two types for patients having their prostate removed. We also want to learn about the side effects of each anesthesia type and assess pain that you experience after surgery.    ,NCT00200187

Prostate Cancer,A Randomized Controlled Trial to Promote Physician-Patient Discussion of Prostate Cancer Screening, Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer among men. It is also the second leading cause of cancer-related death among men. Two screening tests are available to try to detect prostate cancer early ??the digital rectal examination (DRE) and the prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test. Unfortunately physicians aren?t sure whether or not these two screening tests help save lives and there?s a lot of controversy about how to use them. Recently a major government committee (the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) recommended that physicians discuss the risks and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening with their patients and allow patients to make their own decision. Because of the controversies many physicians currently don?t discuss prostate cancer with their patients. The problem is that it takes time and effort to have these discussions and the information is complicated. A lot of patients have trouble understanding it especially if they have a limited educational background or trouble reading. When patients have difficulty obtaining understanding and acting on basic health information we say that they have ?low health literacy.??Other researchers have shown that patients with low health literacy don?t know as much about cancer screening and are less likely to get screened for various cancers. They also tend to be timid about discussing things with their doctor and often go along with what the doctor says rather than taking an active role in the decision making. In 2003 under IRB approval we conducted a study with 2 goals: 1) to encourage patients to talk to their doctor about prostate cancer screening and 2) to learn more about the impact of low health literacy on these conversations. To promote conversation we used two handouts given to patients in the waiting room before they saw the doctor. The first was a patient education handout about prostate cancer screening written in very simple terms with useful illustrations. The second was a handout that simply encouraged patients to talk to their doctor about prostate cancer. Patients got one of the two handouts or a nutritional handout that served as a control. After they saw their doctor a research assistant briefly interviewed the patient to find out whether or not prostate cancer screening was discussed. We also measured the patients??health literacy skills and asked a few other questions about their decision to get screened for prostate cancer.    ,NCT00208988
Prostate Cancer,Phase I/II Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this study is to examine the clinical feasibility of using IMRT combined with daily pretreatment prostate localization to deliver increasingly hypofractionated treatment courses. Progressively larger fraction sizes will be delivered in a phase I design based on both acute and long-term tolerances to the treatment. The dose-per-fraction escalation design utilizes schemas that maintain an isoeffective dose for late effects while predicting that tumor control will actually improve. The delivery of fewer larger fractions of radiation if proven effective and safe would result in significant cost saving and more efficient use of resources.    ,NCT00214097
Prostate Cancer,Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) Radiotherapy for Treating Prostate Pelvic Nodes," The purpose of this study is to examine the clinical feasibility and efficacy of uing IMRT to escalate the biologically effective dose to the pelvic lymph nodes in a short course of radiation therapy. An increased total and biologically effective dose will be delivered to the pelvic lymph nodes (56 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction). The prostate will receive standard ""short course"" IMRT of radiation (70 Gy at 2.5 Gy/fraction).    ",NCT00214136
Prostate Cancer,Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer, BACKGROUND: -This study represents a progression from findings in four previous NCI ROB protocols (02-C-0167A 02-C-0207E 03-C-0190B 04-C-0171). In these previous works we have begun to develop techniques to obtain Magnetic Resonance (MR) biological images and co-register tissue in prostate cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: -The primary objective of the first portion of this study is to assess the feasibility of using IMRT to treat the at-risk lymph nodes in prostate cancer. Also if feasible we hope optimize this technique with experience. ELIGIBILITY: -This is a study of image guided targeted radiation therapy in patients with high risk of nodal metastases from prostate cancer. Patients with prostate cancer who have more than 15% risk of lymph node (as defined by the Partin tables) metastasis will be eligible for this study. DESIGN:   -  On the first 10 patients we will perform approximately 5CT simulations throughout the course of their therapy. On each simulation the initial treatment plan will be re-run. The dose-volume data from target and normal tissues will then be re-analyzed. From this analysis we will be better able to determine the size of margins needed to account for organ motion and changes such as varying amounts of gas in the bowel and fluid in the bladder. To the best of our knowledge no such analyses have been published.   -  If the initial part of this trial is feasible we will proceed to a phase I dose escalation trial of radiation to the at-risk lymph nodes. The primary statistical objective of the phase I portion of this study is to estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of external beam radiation based on evaluating acute toxicity. The study will be conducted with a dose-escalation design with 3 patients in each dose cohort. If fewer than 2 of 3 patients experience an acute DLT than patients will be accrued to the next dose cohort. If 2 or more of 3 patients experience a DLT then the MTD will be exceeded and the prior lower dose cohort will be considered the MTD. Secondary objectives of this study are to relate patterns in gene and protein expression to response and toxicity and to evaluate the frequency of late term toxicity.   -  Specific procedures and risks will be described in a separate consent to be obtained at the time of biopsy. Tissue samples will be processed for cDNA microarray testing and stored for future analysis in the Radiation Oncology Branch NCI.   -  Anatomic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MR biological images of the prostate and pelvis will be obtained and tissue will be acquired with biopsy locations precisely translated (co-registered) to an MR image of reference. A fiducial marker (gold seed) will be left at the biopsy site as a fiducial marker to direct future radiation therapy to the prostate. If necessary additional fiducial markers will be placed for prostate localization during treatment.    ,NCT00214422
Prostate Cancer,A Phase II Trial of Combination Therapy With Celecoxib and Taxotere for the Treatment of Stage D3 Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out the safety and effectiveness as well as patient?s quality of life on the combination of Taxotere and celecoxib on patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. Celecoxib (Celebrex) is an FDA approved drug to treat arthritis. Taxotere (Docetaxel) is an FDA approved chemotherapy drug to treat certain forms of cancer. Both drugs have demonstrated evidences of tumor blood vessel suppression and combination of these two drugs could possibly arrest further tumor growth or make the tumor decrease in size.    ,NCT00215345
Prostate Cancer,Can Tadalafil Maintain Erectile Function In Patients Treated With Radiotherapy For Prostate Cancer?, Because of the high incidence of post-radiation erectile dysfunction (ED) up to 72% after external-beam radiotherapy this patient category represents a most difficult therapeutic challenge. Therefore prevention of ED could be more effective than treatment. Tadalafil a new phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor has been recently introduced. No studies have investigated the efficacy of tadalafil in preventing ED in patients undergoing radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Efficacy of tadalafil can last up to 36 hours after intake. This will result in a prolonged and continuos enhancement of penile vascular responsiveness. This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy of 20-mg of tadalafil administered for 12 months in maintaining erectile function of potent patients undergoing external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.    ,NCT00215631

Prostate Cancer,Pemetrexed as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer, Docetaxel-based therapy has been shown to prolong survival as first-line therapy for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) and has become the standard of care. The beneficial effects of any therapy in HRPC may be diverse and include reduction in tumor bulk (when measurable) reduction in prostate-specific antigen PSA reduction in symptoms (particularly pain) or stabilization of disease. Clear reductions in tumor bulk or PSA may provide objective evidence of a treatment effect and stabilization of disease may be just as clinically meaningful in patients who are actively progressing prior to starting therapy. Pemetrexed has shown a broad array of activity in many diseases that until now were thought to be non-responsive to chemotherapy in the second-line setting. This trial is designed to further assess the efficacy safety tolerability and pharmacogenetics of pemetrexed as a single agent in subjects with HRPC whose disease has progressed following one prior taxane-based chemotherapy regimen for HRPC.    ,NCT00216099

Prostate Cancer,Study on the Role of Hormonal Treatment for Two Dosage Levels of Prostate Radiation Therapy Versus Prostate Radiation Therapy Alone, The hypothesis of the proposed study would be that due to the six months of total androgen blockade which would include neoadjuvant hormonal therapy for four months and concomitant hormonal therapy for two months with irradiation the investigators could reduce local failure rates for these two dosage levels namely 70 Gy and 76 Gy. Since increasing the dose to the prostate also seems to reduce local relapse rates the results of the two hormonal therapy groups would be compared with the results of prostate irradiation at doses of 76 Gy. This study would verify the possibility of compensating a six Gy dosage increase of radiation therapy with six months of hormonal therapy between the 70 Gy and 76 Gy groups who received hormonal therapy and also match these results with a dose escalation to the prostate of 76 Gy. In the future this could result in more therapeutic choices such as reducing the doses of radiation therapy and consequently its related complications if hormonal therapy proves to be beneficial; or rather to continue in the direction of dose escalation for this intermediate-risk patient group everything being correlated to the side effects of hormonal therapy and irradiation.    ,NCT00223145
Prostate Cancer,Duration of Androgen Blockade Combined With Pelvic Irradiation in Prostate Cancers, The objective of this study is to use as a reference the 36-month duration of hormonal therapy according to the European Organization for Research of the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC protocol 22863) : namely one-month of total androgen blockade followed by a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist all for three years combined with pelvic and prostate irradiation; this arm is currently considered to be a standard for high-risk prostate cancers. The proposed study intends to challenge the duration of hormonal therapy and verify whether the five-year outcomes in favour of combined treatment in regard to survival (79% versus 62%) and local control (85% versus 48%) can be transposed for hormonal therapy that is half as long namely 18 months with the possibility of hormone salvage therapy in the event of biochemical and/or clinical failure (local regional or distant); this applies to both arms. The proposed study will compare survival in the two groups and evaluate in each one the total duration of initial hormonal therapy followed by initial hormonal therapy combined with salvage hormonal therapy the duration of salvage hormonal therapy until hormonal therapy resistance and the side effects of this hormonal therapy with everything being related to an assessment of the quality of life of these patients.    ,NCT00223171
Prostate Cancer,Intermittent Hormone Therapy in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy or Radical Prostatectomy, Sometimes blood levels of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) will rise in men who have had prostate surgery or received radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. A low value for the PSA is more desirable as is may indicate no tumor growth. Giving the hormone therapy intermittently (in cycles of treatment and off treatment periods) appears to delay the change of prostate cancer to a type of prostate cancer that resists hormone therapy. If it does the prostate cancer will be treatable for a longer period of time as well as improve the quality of life. Mental functioning is monitored during therapy to see if this treatment has any impact on memory or ability to carry out tasks. In addition extra tubes of blood are obtained to test for Amyloid-B protein (AB protein) whose presence may be associated with problem solving decline.    ,NCT00223665
Prostate Cancer,Docetaxel Androgen Ablation Therapy and External-Beam Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy such as leuprolide may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving docetaxel together with androgen ablation therapy and external-beam radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel when given together with androgen ablation therapy and external-beam radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer.    ,NCT00225420
Prostate Cancer,PR.7 Companion Trial: Effect of Intermittent Versus Continuous Androgen Suppression on Bone Loss and Body Composition, The purpose of this study is to determine in patients entered on the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC)-PR.7 trial of intermittent versus continuous androgen ablation whether the rates of osteoporosis fractures and alteration in body composition are reduced by intermittent androgen ablation. There will be two groups of patients:   1. A cross-sectional group of 150 patients registered in PR.7 prior to January 1 2002 randomized between intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) and continuous androgen suppression (CAS) (75 from each group). Patients who have definite bone metastases are excluded from this study. Biochemical failure does not exclude the patient.   2.

Prostate Cancer,The Potential Use of BOLD MRI as a Noninvasive Measure of Tumor Hypoxia in Prostate Cancer, Hypoxia (low oxygen level) is know to be present in many tumors and may strongly influence the success of treatment and the progression of disease in prostate cancer. The method used to measure tumor oxygen levels in prostate cancer is to place a needle in the prostate itself through the rectum. Blood oxygen level dependent imaging (BOLD MRI) is a special MRI technique that allows indirect assessment of oxygen levels in blood. This technique is non-invasive involving no needles. BOLD has not been applied in humans in prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to develop a MRI-BOLD technique that allows us to non-invasively measure changes related to tumor hypoxia in prostate cancer. This technique may provide information that will be an independent predictor of patient survival tumor recurrence and likelihood of treatment response in prostate cancer    ,NCT00242073

Prostate Cancer,Flu/TBI in Treating Patients Not Responding to Previous Hormone Therapy, RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy such as fludarabine and radiation therapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving fludarabine together with total-body irradiation works in treating patients who are undergoing a donor stem cell transplant for progressive metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to previous hormone therapy.    ,NCT00242931
Prostate Cancer,Isoflavones and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Eating a diet high in soy foods may slow the progression of some types of cancer. Isoflavones are compounds found in soy food that may slow the growth of prostate cancer cells and prevent further development of prostate cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving isoflavones together with radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving isoflavones together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with localized prostate cancer.    ,NCT00243048

Prostate Cancer,Hormone Therapy With or Without Squalamine Lactate in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing a Radical Prostatectomy for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs such as leuprolide and bicalutamide may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens. Squalamine lactate may stop the growth of prostate cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving hormone therapy together with squalamine lactate before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving hormone therapy together with squalamine lactate works compared to hormone therapy alone in treating patients who are undergoing a radical prostatectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer.    ,NCT00244920
Prostate Cancer,Fulvestrant in Treating Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Estrogen may cause the growth of prostate cancer cells.

Prostate Cancer,STAMPEDE: Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy: A Multi-Stage Multi-Arm Randomised Controlled Trial, Prostate cancers depend upon the male hormone testosterone for their growth. Lowering testosterone levels (either by removing all or part of both testes or by giving anti-hormone treatment) slows the growth of prostate cancers. This type of treatment is called hormone treatment and is often used when prostate cancers have spread outside of the prostate gland. Although hormone treatment is usually successful at stopping the cancer growing for a period of time the cancer will begin to grow again in most men. There are increasing numbers of treatments available for advanced prostate cancer. These treatments are usually used in prostate cancer when hormone treatment is no longer effective and the cancer has started to grow again. The aim of this trial which is called STAMPEDE is to assess five of these treatments given earlier in the course of the disease in combination with hormone treatment. The treatments assessed during the trial are:   1. Zoledronic acid: Prostate cancer cells can spread to bones and weaken them. Zoledronic acid is a drug that reduces bone destruction and hardens bones. This may make them more resistant to attack by cancer cells.   2. Docetaxel: A drug that stops cells replicating Docetaxel is currently being used to treat a range of cancers including lung breast and ovarian cancer as well as prostate cancer. Docetaxel is already known to prolong survival in men with relapsed metastatic prostate cancer.   3. Celecoxib: An aspirin-like drug that is used to treat arthritis. Celecoxib slows down the growth of cancer cells in the laboratory. We wished to see if it had the same effect on cancer cells in patients. Recruitment to new patients for the evaluation of this drug is finished as a pre-planned interim analysis failed to demonstrate sufficient activity.   4. Abiraterone (included from protocol version 8.0): An inhibitor of steroid hormone synthesis that blocks prostate cancer cells from generating their own male hormones. This is thought to be a major way in which prostate cancer cells resume growth following castration based therapies. This agent is given along with prednisolone and is already known to prolong survival when given to men following failure of docetaxel chemotherapy.   5. Prostate radiotherapy (included from protocol version 9.0): Treatment with high-energy x-rays targeted to the prostate gland. This treatment is now mandatory for patients with cancer that is confined to the prostate gland as large trials have shown it improves survival times. We are interested in whether we should give radiotherapy to the prostate if the cancer has already spread.   6. Enzalutamide (included from protocol version 12.0): This is a blocker of androgen receptors. These stimulate the cancer when hormone therapies have failed. Enzalutamide may be mutually complementary to abiraterone in terms of blocking mechanisms of resistance. The agent prolongs survival when given to men following failure of docetaxel chemotherapy. STAMPEDE will look at the effect of combining one or two of the treatments described above with hormone treatment. A computer program will be used to allocate which treatment the patient receives using a chance process. The trial will look at the effects of the combined treatments on quality of life and find out whether the new treatment combinations increase the time when the cancer is not growing and ultimately results in patients living longer. The study will also look at which treatment provides the greater value for money for the health service. More than 8000 patients will join the trial with answers becoming available over 7 to 12 years.    ,NCT00268476
Prostate Cancer,Pilot Efficacy Study of PI-88 With Docetaxel to Treat Prostate Cancer, Docetaxel (Taxotere) is an approved chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer. The aim of the study is to investigate whether addition of the investigational drug PI-88 will increase the efficacy of docetaxel in this disease. PI-88 inhibits cancer growth by inhibiting the development of new blood vessels and starving the tumour of oxygen and nutrients (anti-angiogenic). Because PI-88 and docetaxel have different mechanisms of action they are expected to have increased (synergistic) activity when combined.    ,NCT00268593

The investigators will enroll two groups of men with stage IV metastatic prostate cancer each group will be comprised of 160 patients.   -  Group I: men with newly diagnosed hormone-responsive measurable metastatic disease who will be treated with androgen-ablation therapy   -  Group II: men with newly-developed hormone-refractory measurable metastatic disease who will be treated with chemotherapy and /or other therapies for hormone refractory disease To be eligible men in either group must have rising serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level - defined as at least 2 consecutive rises in PSA documented over a reference value (1st measure within 28 days prior to recruitment). The first rising PSA (2nd measure) should be taken at least 14 days after the reference value. A confirmatory PSA measure (3rd measure) obtained at least 14 days after the 2nd measure is required and must be greater than the 2nd measure. Additionally patients must have a serum PSA concentration of at least 2 ng/mL in addition to increasing PSA to be eligible. Patients will be followed with the PET-CT at 4 8 and 12 months after the initiation of androgen ablation therapy (Group I) or chemotherapy (Group II).    ,NCT00282906
Prostate Cancer,To Lengthen the Duration of the Off-Treatment of Intermittent Androgen Suppression," The purpose of this research study is to determine if an investigational drug called Exisulind will extend the ""off-treatment"" period of patients receiving intermittent androgen suppression. There is evidence suggesting that alternating between periods of treatment and no treatment with androgen suppressants may delay the time to develop androgen-insensitive progression and improve overall quality of life. During intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) treatments men receive an LHRH agonist and antiandrogen for a fixed period of time (approximately 9 months) and then enter an off-treatment period whose length will vary depending on the rate of rise in the patient's PSA. Once the PSA reaches an established threshold (1 ng/mL in men who have had a prostatectomy or 4 ng/ml in men with an intact prostate) androgen suppression will be re-initiated for another 9 months. These cycles of on-treatment/off-treatment will be repeated until patient no longer responds to the androgen suppression and it is clear that their cancer is progressing. It has been observed that off-treatment periods tend to become shorter with each successive cycle of androgen suppression presumably due to the emergence of androgen-independent clones. This study proposes to look at exisulind a pro-apoptotic drug which may extend the off-treatment period in patients receiving IAS.    ",NCT00283803
Prostate Cancer,Immunotherapy After Chemotherapy for Patients With Hormone Refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this study is to test if interleukin-2 a drug that stimulates the immune system can be used after chemotherapy to slow the progression of your disease. We also want to test what the best dose of interleukin-2 is that can be used safely at home. Interleukin-2 abbreviated as IL2 is a naturally produced growth hormone for the immune cells in our body. It stimulates the growth of the immune cells and enhances their ability to fight infections and cancers. In people with cancer the immune cells are typically suppressed and became even more so after irradiation and chemotherapy treatment. By giving you more IL2 we hope to enhance the immune system so that it can fight the cancer better control cancer growth and shrink the cancer.    ,NCT00283829

Prostate Cancer,Hormone Therapy and Radiation Therapy or Hormone Therapy and Radiation Therapy Followed by Docetaxel and Prednisone in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using drugs such as leuprolide goserelin flutamide or bicalutamide may fight prostate cancer by lowering the amount of androgens the body makes. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel and prednisone work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving hormone therapy and radiation therapy together with chemotherapy is more effective than giving hormone therapy together with radiation therapy in treating prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying hormone therapy and radiation therapy followed by docetaxel and prednisone to see how well it works compared to hormone therapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with localized prostate cancer.    ,NCT00288080

This vaccine will be made for each participant's own immune cells (called dendritic cells) obtained by blood donation. Dendritic cells are immune cells whose role is to identify foreign antigens (bacteria viruses or tumor cells for example) in the body and to activate other cells of the immune system to mount an attack on that foreign antigen. Each participant will be randomized into either Arm 1 (experimental treatment only) or Arm 2 (placebo first then the experimental treatment). Participants will be given the vaccine and three boosters as an injection.

Prostate Cancer,Study of SU11248 in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer, -  There are nearly 30000 deaths per year in the United States from prostate cancer making this a large and important target patient population for new cancer treatments.   -  SU011248 is an exciting new experimental drug that inhibits a number of proteins or more specifically receptor tyrosine kinases in tumor cells. These proteins are active in cellular pathways that are important for development and growth of a variety of different cancers. The targets of SU011248 include the receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and others. By blocking the VEGF and PDGF pathways SU011248 can induce death of the blood vessels that nourish the cancer cells and death of the cancer cells themselves.   -  SU011248 has demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in renal cell carcinoma gastrointestinal stromal tumors and other cancers. Its effect against prostate cancer has not been studied to date.   -  This study is directed at two populations of men with advanced prostate cancer:   1. Men with advanced prostate cancer who have a rising PSA despite hormone therapy but have not yet received any chemotherapy.   2. Men with metastatic prostate cancer who have received prior chemotherapy (with a docetaxel-based regimen) and have increasing disease following chemotherapy.   -  Men in this study will receive SU011248 on a six-week repeating schedule with four weeks of daily treatment followed by a two-week rest. The goals of the study are:   1. to determine whether SU011248 is an important therapeutic agent in men with advanced prostate cancer and   2. to identify predictive markers of anti-cancer activity within individual subjects that would allow selective treatment of appropriate subjects in the future.    ,NCT00299741

Prostate Cancer,Survey of Prostate Cancer in Accra Ghana, This study conducted at Korle-Bu Hospital in Accra Ghana will help elucidate the roles of lifestyle and genetic factors in prostate cancer risk. There is a strong variation in risk of prostate cancer throughout the world. The rates of the disease among African Americans are some of the world s highest. In the United States the incidence of prostate cancer is 70 percent higher in African Americans than in white Americans and the death rate in African Americans is almost double that of white Americans. The reasons for this excessive risk are unknown but both genetic and lifestyle factors have been suggested. Because Africans and African Americans share similar genetic ancestry but have vastly different lifestyles a better understanding of the rates and risk factor profiles for prostate cancer among Africans will provide important clues to what causes the disease. This study will try to assess the incidence of prostate cancer in the West African nation of Ghana. The study has two components:   -  Clinical survey The methods of diagnosis at Korle-Bu will be evaluated and the incidence of prostate cancer over a 5-year period will be estimated.   -  Screening and detection survey A survey of 1000 men between 50 and 74 years of age will estimate the prevalence of both asymptomatic and undiagnosed symptomatic prostate cancer in the Accra population. The clinical survey will use data from the cancer logbook and medical records at Korle-Bu Hospital and the Ghanaian National Census to derive an estimate of prostate cancer incidence within Accra. The estimate will be low since it will be based only on men diagnosed or treated at Korle-Bu and will not include men with asymptomatic disease men diagnosed elsewhere or men without access to medical care. The screening and detection survey will assess the presence of asymptomatic and unrecognized symptomatic prostate cancer using PSA testing and digital rectal examination in a random sample of 1000 men in the general population of Accra. This will provide a high estimate of disease prevalence. The two estimates will provide an approximation of the true incidence rate of the disease in Accra. Comparison of these data with similar data from community surveys of African Americans will provide insight into reasons for the excess risk of prostate cancer in African Americans.    ,NCT00339534
Prostate Cancer,Markers for Early Detection of Prostate Cancer, This study will determine whether certain gene alterations can serve as markers for early detection of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is often diagnosed by detecting high levels of a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. Other conditions can also cause elevated PSA levels however so that additional tests are needed to distinguish between benign and cancerous prostate conditions. Patients between 40 and 75 years of age who are referred to Howard University Hospital in Washington D.C. or Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma Washington for ultrasound and needle biopsy to diagnose prostate cancer may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo the following procedures at the time of the biopsy visit:   -  Blood collection: Patients have 10 milliliters (2 teaspoons) of blood drawn.   -  Prostate massage: Patients have a rectal examination and prostate massage. For the latter procedure the physician lightly massages the prostate gland for about 15 seconds. After the massage the patient provides a urine specimen.   -  Biopsy: A small sample of tumor tissue is removed surgically for examination under the microscope. Patients whose initial biopsy does not show cancer cells but who are advised to have a repeat biopsy in the future will give a blood urine and biopsy specimen at the time of the next biopsy. Patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer and undergo surgery to remove the tumor will have a small sample of tumor tissue set aside for this study to look for substances that may help predict prostate cancer.    ,NCT00340717
Prostate Cancer,Retrospective Analysis of a Drug-Metabolizing Genotype in Cancer Patients and Correlation With Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamics Data, This study is a retrospective one exploring the hypothesis that a person's genotypic makeup may be associated with a clinical response or toxic effect to a drug. Genetic polymorphisms that is states of being able to assume different forms that are in drug-metabolizing enzymes transporters and receptors may affect a patient's response to drug therapy. To date there have been limited studies looking at a drug-metabolizing genotype (genetic makeup) or phenotype (result of the genotype's interaction with the environment). However it is often wondered if the variations in a drug's action that is pharmacokinetic effect come from the genotype phenotype relationship. Participants who entered previous clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute as approved by the Central Institutional Review Board may be eligible for this study. Studies for which pharmacokinetic analyses were or are being performed will be the source of the patient population. Genotyping experiments will be performed through genomic DNA isolated from stored frozen serum. The genotyping results will be compared with pharmacokinetic data and clinical outcomes. Clinical data will consist of what is obtained during the course of the principal pharmacokinetic study. The results of the retrospective analyses will provide no direct benefit to the participants.    ,NCT00341939
Prostate Cancer,Intraprostatic Androgenicity in Relation to Circulating Levels of Hormones and Polymorphisms of Hormone-Related Genes: A Methodologic Study, Although compelling evidence from laboratory studies suggests that androgens play a major role in prostate carcinogenesis epidemiologic studies in humans (almost exclusively serologic studies) have been unable to confirm the hormonal hypothesis. The major limitation in these serologic studies may stem from difficulty in measuring androgenicity directly at the target site - the prostate. If circulating hormones do not reflect intraprostatic hormone levels or androgenicity it is not clear how we should interpret results from serum/plasma measurements and it is unlikely that future serologic studies can clarify the role of hormones in prostate cancer etiology. This study is a comprehensive methodologic study designed to collect venous blood and prostatic tissue from 650 patients (100 Chinese 500 American and 50 Italian) undergoing prostatic surgery (radical prostatectomy cystoprostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate) in order to correlate prostate tissue with serum hormone levels and with polymorphisms of hormone-related genes (including the androgen receptor and SRD5A2 the gene encoding 5-alpha-reductase Type II) and to examine characteristics (such as age smoking body size) that might affect serum-tissue correlation. We plan to study the following hormones: testosterone dihydrotestosterone androstenedione androstandediol glucuronide estradiol estrone and estrone sulfate. Levels of androgen receptor and its associated protein in prostatic tissue will also be measured to provide a better estimate of total intraprostatic androgenicity. We also plan to collect saliva from 100 of these cases in the Washington D.C. area and 100 of these cases in China to assess whether this non-invasive tissue collection method is valid for hormone measurements. Finally urine collection from 100 of these Chinese men is planned for study of androgen metabolites. Additionally we plan to include 200 Chinese subjects for blood collection without tumor tissue for gene polymorphism studies bringing the total number of subjects enrolled to 850. For the 650 subjects providing prostate tissue 30-ml of fasting blood will be collected for hormone and polymorphism analyses and tissue will be collected at surgery. A 15-minute interview will be conducted to elicit information on demographic characeristics tobacco and alcohol use body size and medical history. The proposed methodologic study will be the first of its kind to investigate androgenicity in target tissues directly and the correlation of target tissue androgenicity with circulating levels of hormones and polymorphisms of hormone-related genes in a well-designed epidemiologic study. This study will provide critical information to guide future analytic studies on hormones and prostate cancer.    ,NCT00342433
Prostate Cancer,An Epidemiological Study of Genetic Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer in African-American and Caucasian Males, This study will examine the association of genetic variants and gene expression patterns with the risk of prostate cancer. There will be (It will include?) genotype analysis of blood DNA from 600 patients with the disease and from 600 healthy people and there will be a gene expression analysis of prostate tumors. Prostate cancer is a leading cause of death among men in Western countries. It is estimated that 220000 or more new cases of the disease will occur in the United States during 2004. The disease incidence is rising. About 25% to 30% of the cancers become aggressive. The nonhereditary disease rarely occurs in men who are younger than age 40. There are large differences in incidence by geography and race. The highest rates are seen among African-American men in the United States. Also although Caucasians have a lower rate of disease incidence and mortality in the United States the rates among them are high compared with rates in some European countries. The reasons for such differences are not well understood but both environmental and genetic risk factors are thought to be involved. Patients ages 40 to 80 years who have had prostate cancer confirmed within the past 6 months who reside in Baltimore City or adjacent metropolitan counties and who were born in the United States may be eligible for this study. They will be recruited in collaboration with the Departments of Pathology and Urology at the University of Maryland and the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Those men serving as controls in this study will be identified through the Department of Motor Vehicles database and will be matched by age and race with the patients who have cancer. The study will include 600 participants with prostate cancer and 600 participants in the control group. Trained interviewers will administer two questionnaires. The primary questionnaire will be used to assess information such as medical and cancer history tobacco use current medications occupational history family medical history and socioeconomic status. A supplemental questionnaire will pertain to patients' exposure to risk factors for prostate cancer. It will assess the human body diet medical history family medical history and sexual history. The section on sexual history will be self-administered. Patients will undergo collection of blood and urine for various tests. For cancer patients with prostate surgery there will also be a collection of tissue to be performed at the time that the prostate gland is scheduled for surgical removal. The pattern of gene expression will be analyzed in low- and high-stage tumors. There will be no direct benefit from participating in the study but participants will receive an incentive of up to $75 to participate in the study. No form of treatment is involved in this study. However it is hoped that the study findings will improve researchers' understanding of prostate cancer biology with respect to the causes of the health variances between African-Americans and Caucasians.    ,NCT00342771
Prostate Cancer,Identification of Prostate Cancer Genes," This study will identify genes that predispose men to prostate cancer and affect the rate and type of disease spread the aggressiveness of the disease and the long-term outcome. Several studies show there is a genetic component to prostate cancer susceptibility and that a first-degree relative with prostate cancer increases a man's risk 2- to 3-fold compared to those without a family history. The risk is significantly higher if the relative was diagnosed at younger than 65 years of age or if three or more first-degree relatives are affected. The study will try to locate prostate cancer genes in DNA samples using two methods: linkage analysis and association studies. Traditionally the search for a disease gene begins with linkage analysis in which the aim is to find the rough location of the gene relative to another DNA sequence called a ""genetic marker"" whose position is already known. In genetic association studies genes from a large number of patients are compared with healthy controls who are matched by age race and geographic region. DNA samples for this study come from patients in the two following studies at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Seattle Washington: Family study: Participants are families with prostate cancer who have: 1) three or more first-degree relatives with prostate cancer; 2) three generations with prostrate cancer either through the maternal or paternal side of the family; or 3) two first-degree relatives with prostate cancer diagnosed before age 65 or who were African American. Population-based study: Participants are patients with prostate cancer and matched healthy control subjects. The identification of prostate cancer genes important in susceptibility to the disease and its aggressiveness may permit earlier detection and development of more directed and effective treatments based on underlying genetics.

Prostate Cancer,Agriculture Health Study," The ""Agricultural Health Study"" (AHS) is a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are providing support for a limited exposure assessment effort. Initial data collection on a prospective cohort of 89658 study subjects has been completed as of December 1997. Participants completed questionnaires that included items on pesticides used other agricultural exposures and work practices that modify exposure as well as on other activities that may affect either exposure or disease risks (e.g. diet exercise alcohol consumption medical conditions family history of cancer other occupations and smoking history). Phase II of the study (1998-2003) updated information on occupational exposures diet work practices and medical history by means of a computer assisted telephone interview. We also collected buccal cells on sample of 34000 study participants to assess the effect of inheritable polymorphisms and the interaction of environment and genomic predisposition. The stimulus for this prospective investigation comes from the growing evidence that despite a low mortality overall farmers experience an excess of several cancers. These excesses have been observed in retrospective epidemiological studies among agricultural workers in several countries. Excess cancers are observed for the lymphatic and hematopoietic system connective tissue skin brain prostate stomach and lips. Several of these tumors (brain NHL multiple myeloma and prostate) are also increasing in the general population in many of these countries. This suggests a common set of exposures may explain the high rates in farmers and rising rates in the general population. Farmers their families and other pest control workers may have contact with a variety of potentially hazardous substances including pesticides solvents fuels and oils engine exhaust dust and zoonotic viruses and other microbes. Our cohort study includes all registered pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina and the spouse of applicators who are farmers. The health effects of pesticide use are the primary focus of the study. The influence of other farm exposures are also being evaluated. The focus of the phase II follow-up period (2004-2008) is to update exposure information and health histories by means of a computer assisted interview and also following the cohort to determine disease incidence and mortality. The cohort is being followed through the cancer registries within Iowa and North Carolina the Social Security Administration database state vital statistics offices National Death Index and various in-state databases such as the listing of registered pesticide applicators. Individuals who enrolled into the study but who are no longer at the address given during enrollment (based on subsequent attempts at follow up) have been submitted and will continue to be submitted (through NIOSH) in the standard format to the IRS under their Project 057 Taxpayer Address Request Program. Identifying data provided to the IRS include only SSN and the first four letters of last name of cohort member. IRS provides in return the most current address in IRS records if a match (SSN + all four letter of last name) is found. The purpose of this effort is to identify members of the cohort who have moved out of state to enable adjustment of person-years for incidence and mortality calculations. Persons who have moved out of state can be followed for vital status and cause of death but not for cancer incidence. Continuation of the protocol will provide a valuable epidemiologic resource to help prevent cancers in the future by identifying risk factors in the rural/agricultural environment. Because more cases of important cancer outcomes occur in this cohort every year potential cancer causes can be evaluated with increased statistical power. Larger number of cases also allows for statistical control of confounding factors making more meaningful conclusions about cancer risk and for some relatively infrequent cancers such as the lyphomas and leukemias greater follow-up time is necessary to make any meaningful observations.

Prostate Cancer,Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer With Indolent Features, In patients with prostate cancer with indolent features disease progrssion may be very slow and in many cases will never become clinically evident during the patient's lifetime. Active surveillance is a continuous process of monitoring disease characteristcs aiming to avoid the morbidity of active therapy in patients with stabe indolent parameters while offering early detection of disease activity in others who will need active therapy to control their disease. We hypothesize that active surveillance will permit the avoidance of therapy related morbidity in the majority of appropriate patients and will be associated with maintaining their quality of life.    ,NCT00421265
Prostate Cancer,Positive Surgical Margins Rate and EGFR Family Members Expression in Prostate Cancer Treated With Bicalutamide, Following radical prostatectomy (RP) about 20% to 40% of the patients with prostate cancer (PCa) exhibit pathological parameters which are associated with a high risk of disease recurrence. The rationale for NHT is based on the theory that androgen ablation induces PCa apoptosis which induces a regression of the primary tumor bulk before RP. However the use of NHT prior RP is highly controversial. In spite of these unenthusiastic results the relative short time of treatment and the use of different drugs from those utilized in other trials might still to make this regimen attractive in terms of drug related side effects and effectiveness. In this regard Bicalutamide presents unique characteristics since it work differently respect to other anti-hormonal agents by interfering on both genotropic and non-genotropic mechanisms of androgen receptor    ,NCT00421694

Prostate Cancer,Local Anesthesia for Prostate Biopsy, Title: Local anesthesia for office biopsy of the prostate: effects on pain control quality of life and surgical intervention. Introduction: Local anesthetic should be administered prior to transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate to control pain in the office setting. Various centers have injected anesthetic in different regions in and around the prostate prior to biopsy. Patient experience with each technique has varied. We would like to determine which procedure provides the best pain control. In addition we would like to know if the anesthetic placement has any effect on urinary patterns bowel habits and sexual function. Furthermore for those patients found to have cancer and elect surgical treatment we plan to evaluate if the anesthetic had an impact on surgical dissection of their prostate. Methods: The investigators plan to identify those patients who require prostate biopsy for diagnosis. Each patient will be randomly assigned to a different anesthetic injection group. During the biopsy protocol our nurse will monitor the patient?s pain level according to the visual analog score. The patient will complete a pre-biopsy questionnaire and two post-biopsy questionnaires administered at 1 and 4 weeks after biopsy. He will receive results of the prostate biopsy pathology report within 48 hours by calling his primary referral service.    ,NCT00422708

Prostate Cancer,AZD2171 to Treat Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  AZD2171 (Cediranib) is an experimental drug that inhibits formation of new blood vessels.   -  Tumors need new blood vessels to grow. Preventing the growth of new blood vessels with AZD2171 may inhibit tumor growth. Objectives: -To determine the effectiveness and side effects of AZD2171 in patients with prostate cancer that has metastasized (spread beyond the primary site). Eligibility:   -  Males 18 years of age and older with androgen-independent prostate cancer that has metastasized.   -  Patients must have received prior treatment with docetaxel. Design: Patients take one AZD2171 by mouth every day in 28-day treatment cycles and undergo the following procedures:   -  1- to 2-day hospitalization at the start of the study for biopsies and blood measurements to determine the level of AZD2171 in the bloodstream. Blood is drawn immediately before the first dose and 0.25 hr 0.5 hr 1 hr 2 hr 4 hr 6 hr 8 hr 12 hr 24 hr and 48 hours after the dose is taken.   -  Blood tests before starting treatment and then monthly to determine the level of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR) a protein involved in blood vessel formation.   -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans once a month to evaluate blood flow.   -  Tumor biopsies (optional) both before and after the second and sixth treatment cycles.   -  Clinic visits every 4 weeks including various routine and research blood tests urine test and electrocardiogram.   -  Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis every 8 weeks   -  Bone scan every 8 weeks Patients record all doses of AZD2171 taken or missed in a pill diary. They record their blood pressure at least once daily in a blood pressure diary. Treatment may continue as long as the patient tolerates the AZD2171 and the cancer does not worsen.    ,NCT00436956

Prostate Cancer,Study On Lidocaine Vs. Placebo Pain Control During Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Prostate Biopsy, Patients at risk for having prostate cancer usually undergo a biopsy of their prostate. This is most often done in the private urology office. Recent studies have suggested that injection of local anesthesia (lidocaine) near the nerves of the prostate will improve pain sensation during the biopsy procedure. Local anesthesia can be given through a separate needle through the rectal probe just prior to biopsy. However many urologists to date perform their biopsies without anesthesia. Some claim that the needle used for anesthesia causes pain itself. Others claim that the pain is so minimal that the additional use of lidocaine (and extra time) is not necessary. We plan to reexamine the use of lidocaine and perform the first study where each patient will receive lidocaine and placebo on separate sides of their prostate.    ,NCT00441532

Prostate Cancer,Study to Assess the Non-inferiority of Pamorelin® 1125mg SC Injected Versus Pamorelin® 1125mg IM Injected in Patients Suffering From Advanced Prostate Cancer (PAMOJECT), The active ingredient of Pamorelin® 1125 mg is Triptorelin. Triptorelin is a substitute for a natural hormone produced in the body called Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH is a hormone secreted by hypothalamus (a gland located in brain) and controls the production of sex hormones (eg testosterone in men) in other organs in the body. The growth of prostate cancer cells one of the most common cancers in men is induced by the hormone testosterone. Hormonotherapy is one of treatments available to treat this type of disease by controlling the testosterone serum level.

Prostate Cancer,Vaccine Therapy With PROSTVAC/TRICOM and Flutamide Versus Flutamide Alone to Treat Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  Flutamide is an approved drug for prostate cancer that blocks the effects of testosterone on prostate cancer cells and may slow the progression of the disease.   -  The vaccine in this study consists of a priming vaccine called PROSTVAC-V/TRICOM made from vaccinia virus and a boosting vaccine called PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM made from fowlpox virus. DNA is inserted into the priming and boosting vaccine viruses to cause production of proteins that enhance immune activity and also to produce prostate specific antigen (PSA) a protein that is normally produced by the patient s tumor cells.   -  GM-CSF given along with the vaccine is a chemical that boosts the immune system. It is used in this study to try to increase the usefulness of the vaccine by increasing the number of immune cells at the vaccination site. Objectives: -To determine if treatment with a prostate cancer vaccine plus flutamide is more effective than flutamide alone in delaying disease progression in patients with prostate cancer. Eligibility:   -  Patients 18 years of age and older with androgen-insensitive prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate gland.   -  Patients with a rising PSA who have already been treated with anti-iandrogen therapy (either bicalutamide or nilutamide). Design:   -  There are two treatment groups in this study. Group A receives only flutamide; group B receive flutamide plus vaccine.   -  Patients in both groups receive flutamide by mouth three times a day.   -  Patients in group B receive PROSTVAC-V/TRICOM on day 1 and PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM on day 29 and again every 4 weeks. All vaccines are given as injections under the skin.   -  Patients have blood tests for PSA levels every month and scans every 3 months until the disease worsens.   -  After 3 months of therapy patients receiving in group A (flutamide alone) may cross over to receive vaccine if they develop a rising PSA and scans show no sign of disease spread. Patients in group B (flutamide plus vaccine) stop flutamide and may continue vaccine therapy. At this point patients may continue to receive treatment until the disease progresses or PSA levels rise....    ,NCT00450463
Prostate Cancer,153Sm-EDTMP With or Without a PSA/TRICOM Vaccine To Treat Men With Androgen-Insensitive Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  No treatment is known to improve survival for prostate cancer patients who have not been helped by previous treatments with hormones and chemotherapy.   -  An experimental vaccine called prostate specific antigen (PSA)/TRICOM contains genes for a protein produced by prostate cancer cells called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The vaccine can trigger the immune system to make cells that may be able to recognize and attack the cancer cells that make PSA.   -  Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an approved drug that is usually given to increase a patient's white blood cell count or to stimulate the immune system.   -  1Samarium-153-ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (53Sm-EDTMP) is a radioactive drug that has been approved for many years to treat advanced prostate cancer. It is given through a vein and can be targeted directly to tumors in the bone where it can relieve pain caused by bone lesions. Radiation also increases the level of certain proteins inside the tumor making it easier for the immune system to find and kill the tumor cells.   -  When laboratory mice were given just vaccine just radiation or a combination of both the combination was most effective in treating tumors. Objectives: -To determine if combined treatment with PSA/TRICOM vaccine and 153Sm-EDTMP radiation can delay progression of prostate cancer better than radiation alone. Eligibility: -Patients who have advanced prostate cancer that has worsened despite treatments with hormones have two or more bone lesions related to their prostate cancer and have had prior treatment with docetaxel chemotherapy. Design:   -  Patients are randomly assigned to receive radiation alone (Arm A) or radiation with vaccine and sargramostim (Arm B).   -  Arm A receives 153Sm-EDTMP radiation starting on study day 8 and repeated every 12 weeks.   -  Arm B receives a priming vaccine on study day 1 and radiation on day 8. Radiation therapy is repeated every 12 weeks. Boosting vaccines are given on days 15 and 29 and then monthly. GM-CSF is given with each vaccination (on the day of the vaccination and for the next 3 days) to enhance the immune response. Vaccinations and GM-CSF are given as injections under the skin usually in the thigh. Radiation therapy is given through a vein.   -  Patients are monitored regularly with physical examinations blood and urine tests and scans to evaluate safety and treatment response.   -  Patients who are human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group (HLA-A2)-positive undergo apheresis a procedure similar to donating blood for obtaining immune cells called lymphocytes to measure the immune response to the vaccine.    ,NCT00450619

Prostate Cancer,Radiation Therapy Androgen Suppression and Docetaxel in Treating Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer Who Have Undergone Radical Prostatectomy, RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high-dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy such as leuprolide goserelin flutamide or bicalutamide may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with androgen suppression and docetaxel after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving radiation therapy together with androgen suppression and docetaxel works in treating patients with high risk prostate cancer who have undergone radical prostatectomy.    ,NCT00528866
Prostate Cancer,Implant Radiation Therapy Using Radioactive Iodine in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Implant radiation therapy delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

Prostate Cancer,Investigational Study For the Treatment of Localized (T1c/T2a) Prostate Cancer With High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Using the Sonablate 500 (SB-500) System in Canada, An investigational study on the use of HIFU in the management of localized prostate cancer as a primary non-comparative study High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive acoustic ablation technique that uses intersecting precision focused ultrasound waves to raise the temperature of the target to )80-90 degrees C in 2-3 seconds destroying the targeted tissues (prostate cancer). The tissue targeting is highly precise minimizing collateral damage. The overall hypothesis is that HIFU with Sonablate can safely effectively and selectively ablate prostate cancer tissue resulting in complete tissue necrosis in patients diagnosed with localized T1c/T2a prostate cancer with minimal morbidity. The specific hypothesis is that the Sonablate has the ability to:   -  COmpletely destroy prostate cancer tissue without causing damage to the intervening tissue with a drop in PSA levels to <0.5ng/ml.   -  Result in negative biopsies for evidence of viable malignant cells after the treatment(12 months if Nadir is not reached or PSA rises from Nadir)   -  Safely treat localized prostate cancer pts. with minimal and acceptable adverse effects.    ,NCT00537849

Prostate Cancer,Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Common Sage in Controlling Hot Flashes in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated by Androgen Deprivation, The purpose of this clinical phase I study is to measure the efficacy and side effects of Common Sage in the treatment of hot flashes in 10 patients with prostate cancer who receive androgen deprivation (AD) (exclusively or as part of a multimodality treatment) for a period of minimum 6 months. Concomitant use of a non-steroidal anti-androgen during the first month of the AD is permitted to prevent the flair-up phenomenon. However the inclusion of patients in the study will only start at least 2 weeks after the cessation of the anti-androgen. This is done to exclude a possible influence of the anti-androgen on the severity and frequency of hot flashes. Once the informed consent is signed the patient receives the study diary to note the daily frequency and severity of hot flashes and their effect on daily quality of life. The severity of the hot flashes is measured by the Moyad scoring scale. The effect on daily quality of life is measured using the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS). The patient will be instructed in detail how to use the diary. After week 1 the patient returns the diary to the responsible physician. In return the patient receives the study medication (Common Sage product) and a diary for the next week (=week 2). This procedure will be repeated until the end of the observation period (2 months after enrollment in the study). The common Sage will be provided in tablets. The suggested dose of Common Sage is 3 tablets a day (morning - noon - evening). To be sure that the effect of Common Sage is NOT due to an inhibition of the effect of the LHRH analogue the related hormones (testosterone FSH LH free testosterone and SHBG) will be tested at three fixed moments: day of study enrollment 1 month after study enrollment and at the end of the study. In order to check the level of hemoglobin and cholesterol every 2 weeks a blood count will be performed. It has been shown that LHRH analogues can induce anemia and hypercholesterolemia. The investigators want to measure a possible effect of Common Sage on both. There are no known side-effects of the use of Common Sage. All symptoms that could be related to the use of Common Sage will be recorded in detail. Therefore a clinical examination including blood pressure registration will be performed by the responsible physician on a weekly base.    ,NCT00541788

Prostate Cancer,Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Androgen deprivation therapy such as goserelin leuprolide or bicalutamide may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Giving intensity-modulated radiation therapy together with androgen deprivation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well intensity-modulated radiation therapy works in treating patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic prostate cancer.    ,NCT00544830
Prostate Cancer,Vinflunine in Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC), Currently there are no established 2nd-line or salvage chemotherapy regimens for patients with HRPC many of whom retain an excellent performance status. The antitumor characteristics and toxicity profile of vinflunine make it an ideal agent to be investigated in this setting. In this Phase II trial we plan to evaluate the efficacy toxicity and feasibility of administering IV vinflunine at a dose of 320 mg/m2 q3w as salvage chemotherapy in patients with HRPC. The patients will be evaluated for response survival and toxicity. If significant antitumor activity is demonstrated further evaluation of this agent either alone or combination regimens and at earlier stages of disease will be indicated.    ,NCT00545766
Prostate Cancer,Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

Prostate Cancer,FACBC PET/CT for Recurrent Prostate Cancer, Hypothesis:Anti-[18F]FACBC PET-CT will adequately detect local and extraprostatic recurrence and lead to better characterization of disease status in restaging patients. This is a study that will test a compound (chemical substance) that has a small amount of radioactivity attached to it. This substance has a natural tendency to go to prostate tissue. The substance is called [18]FACBC and it is given in the form of an injection into a vein. After the substance reaches the prostate scans called PET or Positron Emission Tomography are done. This is similar to having CAT scans or x-rays. Usually a compound called [18]FDG is used for PET scans but this substance is eliminated by the kidneys and cannot reach the prostate. This substance called [18]FACBC is not eliminated by the kidneys and may allow tumors in the prostate to be seen better. It is sometimes difficult to tell if a growth on the prostate is cancer with scans or x-rays that are usually done. Anti-[18F]FACBC PET-CT will be compared to ProstaScint (In-capromab pendetide) which is the conventional imaging for prostate cancer. Investigators will be blinded of the intervention. This study will look at how the [18]FACBC goes into the prostate tissue and determine its ability to detect recurrent prostate cancer.    ,NCT00562315

Prostate Cancer,Safety Study & Effectiveness of Docetaxel With RAD001 and Bevacizumab in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is a common and important health issue. Although effective treatment is often available for localized disease metastatic prostate cancer remains incurable. The initial treatment for metastatic prostate cancer often includes medical or surgical treatments that deprive the tumor of male hormones (androgens) required for growth. Although this treatment is successful for many patients the cancer may eventually return in others. Recurrent prostate cancer may be treated with additional hormonal agents but these agents usually do not result in long-term control of the disease. Eventually most patients with recurrent prostate cancer progress to a state where the cancer grows despite very low level of circulating male hormones known as androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC).    ,NCT00574769
Prostate Cancer,Prostate Biomarker Study, Radical Prostatectomy (removal of the prostate) or radiation therapy provide excellent outcomes for patients with localized (confined to one area) disease yet there is still no effective treatment once the disease has spread beyond the prostate gland. Typically a serum PSA test is done to diagnose prostate cancer. Following diagnosis a prostate biopsy and other tests help to classify the patient's disease according to the likelihood of a recurrence. However these assessments are imperfect. There is a need to identify and evaluate prostate biomarkers that will provide exact information regarding the likelihood of a recurrence (prediction) of prostate cancer.    ,NCT00574899

These samples may be stored for future use or used immediately by researchers who study prostate cancer and try to find better ways to diagnose prevent and treat it. We will look for genetic changes and protein markers on these cells. We hope to learn more about what makes some people get prostate cancer why some cancers are more aggressive than others and why some cancers respond to or resist different treatments. We may also try to grow the tumor cells in the lab. We may find a new treatment for prostate cancer based on this research.    ,NCT00578240

Prostate Cancer,Molecular Urine Tests for Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths among men in the United States.1 Although still controversial there is growing evidence that early detection will reduce prostate cancer mortality. Currently the most useful biomarker to aid in early detection is measurement of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. Despite the value of PSA it has substantial limitations. To overcome the limitations of total PSA testing there is emerging evidence demonstrating that relevant cancer biomarker can be detected in urine. Patients who present to the urology clinic for a radical prostatectomy will be asked to enter this study. After obtaining informed consent the following exam and specimen collection scheduled will be followed: Visit 1 (pre-op): Digital Rectal Exam (DRE) - Voided urine collection & serum collection Visit 2 (time of prostatectomy): Under anesthesia- catheterized urine collection and serum collection Visit 3 (approximately 8 days post-prostatectomy): Catheterized urine collection Visit 4 (approximately 3 months post-prostatectomy): Voided urine collection and serum collection Some patients will not have the serum collection at visits 1 2 and 4. The patients will be notified as to whether or not their blood will be drawn during the visits. Pre-operative Digital Rectal Exam urinary catheterization and blood draws are part of standard of care in this patient population with localized prostate cancer. The catheter will be inserted during the time of surgery preparation in the operating room and removed during the post operative clinic appointment.    ,NCT00581516
Prostate Cancer,Anxiety in Black Men With Prostate Cancer: Validation of the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer in an Sample of Black Men, This study is being done to see if a standard tool used to check anxiety in white men works well for Black men. The tool is used only for men who have prostate cancer. It is meant to see how the cancer affects men.

Prostate Cancer,Men Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy, The purpose of this study is to see if the protein pattern in your blood can predict whether or not your prostate tumor is aggressive. We will use a new and very sensitive technique called mass spectroscopy to measure hundreds of pieces of protein in your blood. A computer will make a picture of the protein pattern. We will do this in 500 men before their prostate surgery and see if there is a pattern that predicts what the tumor looks like under the microscope. We will also check the protein pattern in your blood 6 weeks to 12 months after the surgery to see if your pattern changes.    ,NCT00582530
Prostate Cancer,MRI/MRSI in Risk Assessment of Prostate Cancer Patients, The purpose of this study is to see if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can tell which patients with prostate cancer are at a low risk for their cancer growing and spreading. Magnetic resonance methods use magnets and radio waves to take pictures of body structure (MRI) and to measure amounts of important chemicals within the body (MRSI). This study will look at the structural and chemical properties of prostates before undergoing treatment. Hopefully doctors will be able to use this method before making treatment decisions for patients with newly diagnosed cancer of the prostate. This study will continue our work to assess the value of MRI/MRSI in addressing what is currently one of the greatest clinical challenges in the management of prostate cancer: the identification of low-risk organ-confined prostate cancer that can be managed expectantly with deferred treatment.    ,NCT00582543

The investigators hope that this questionnaire will help show how prostate cancer treatments affect quality-of-life. It will help doctors and future patients to make better treatment choices. Some men may wish to have a more demanding treatment with a higher risk of harmful effects. Others may prefer a treatment that will have the smallest effect on their quality-of-life. This questionnaire will help us measure these effects and decide which is the best treatment for a given patient.    ",NCT00582842

Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sorafenib together with docetaxel may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving sorafenib together with docetaxel to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer.    ,NCT00589420
Prostate Cancer,Coping in African American Prostate Cancer Survivors, This study will test the effectiveness of an 8-week group intervention for African American men who have been treated for prostate cancer. The group intervention is based on 1) the cognitive-behavioral theoretical approach to improving adjustment to cancer and 2) masculinity theory as it relates to coping strengths and preferences in men. We will test the effectiveness of this coping skills intervention for improving survivors' quality of life in 4 areas: 1) distress related to sexual urinary and bowel symptoms; 2) self-confidence for managing symptoms; 3) overall emotional functioning; and 4) overall physical functioning. The effect of the coping skills group intervention in these 4 areas will be compared to a comparison intervention in which African American men will receive basic education about prostate cancer but will not participate in coping skills training.    ,NCT00589966

Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Biological therapies such as prednisone may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving docetaxel and prednisone together may kill more tumor cells.    ,NCT00598858
Prostate Cancer,High Dose Rate Prostate Brachytherapy as Salvage for Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With External Beam Radiotherapy, High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy is a form of radiation treatment using temporary radioactive seeds. This is done by placing very tiny catheters or tubes into the prostate and then inserting temporary radioactive seeds called Iridium 192 through these catheters. HDR brachytherapy gives precise radiation to the prostate with less radiation given to the normal tissues near the prostate. For patients who have been treated with external beam radiation to the prostate before HDR brachytherapy can give radiation again to the prostate without exposing the normal tissues around the prostate to significantly more radiation. This may be safer than giving external beam radiation again. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of high dose rate temporary brachytherapy (HDR) for prostate cancer that has come back after external beam radiation. We want to find out what effects good and/or bad the treatment has on you and your recurrent prostate cancer.    ,NCT00604526

Prostate Cancer,Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Progressive Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of a peptide vaccine in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer.    ,NCT00616291
Prostate Cancer,The Specific Role of Isoflavones in Reducing Prostate Cancer Risk, The purpose of this research study is to determine if giving men with early stage (Grade 1-2) prostate cancer dietary supplement from soybeans called isoflavones will change their blood hormone levels. Isoflavones are substances found in a high concentration in soybeans that are converted in the intestines to hormone-like compounds which are similar to estrogen. They are also thought to have cancer fighting properties. Clinical trials suggest that isoflavones can increase certain sex hormones which results in the slower production of prostate cancer cells. This study will determine if adding isoflavones (supplied as Prevastein HC®) 80 mg/day in a pill form can change your risk factors that cause early stage prostate cancer to progress to more advanced disease.    ,NCT00617617
Prostate Cancer,A Phase III Trial of ZD4054 (Zibotentan) (Endothelin A Antagonist) and Docetaxel in Metastatic Hormone Resistant Prostate Cancer, Enthuse M1C is a large phase III clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of ZD4054 (Zibotentan) in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere) in patients with metastatic hormone resistant prostate cancer (HRPC). This clinical trial will test if the Endothelin A Receptor Antagonist ZD4054 (Zibotentan) can further improve survival compared with docetaxel alone. ZD4054 (Zibotentan) is a new type of agent which is thought to slow tumour growth and spread by blocking Endothelin A receptor activity. This trial will look at the effects of ZD4054 (Zibotentan) in hormone resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases compared with docetaxel. All patients participating in this clinical trial will receive docetaxel chemotherapy which is a commonly used chemotherapy to treat prostate cancer in addition to other existing prostate cancer therapies. Half the patients will receive ZD4054 (Zibotentan) and half the patients will receive placebo in addition to docetaxel and other prostate cancer therapy. By participating in this trial there is a 50% chance that patients will receive an agent that may further slow the progression of the tumour. No patients will be deprived of standard prostate cancer therapy.    ,NCT00617669

Prostate Cancer,USPIO-enhanced and Diffusion-weighted MRI for the Detection of Pelvic Lymph Node Metastases, Preoperative detection of lymph node metastases in patients with prostate or bladder cancer is crucial for selection of the appropriate treatment strategy (surgery androgen deprivation with/or without radiation therapy or chemotherapy) and thus for patient prognosis. Until now CT or MRI have been the modalities of choice for preoperative staging procedures. However current morphological assessment of lymph nodes based on size and shape is unable to detect smaller metastases or liable to give false positive results on lymph nodes with reactive hyperplasia. We hypothesize that USPIO-enhanced MRI combined with DW-MRI will be able to detect pelvic lymph node metastases preoperatively with high sensitivity and specificity.    ,NCT00622973
Prostate Cancer,Internet-Based Education for Prostate Cancer Screening, Prostate cancer (PCa) is the leading cancer diagnosis among men and the second leading cause of male cancer death. However screening asymptomatic men remains controversial as early diagnosis and treatment of PCa has not yet demonstrated reduced disease-related mortality in a randomized trial. The goal of the current study is to develop and assess widely accessible methods to assist men in making informed decisions about PCa screening. We will compare the efficacy of a new web-based interactive decision support approach to our existing print-based PCa screening decision tool among a diverse sample of male primary care patients. Abundant evidence documents the expanding role of the Internet in increasing access to and understanding of health information and the need for systematic evaluations of Internet-based interventions. A novel aspect of the proposed trial will be our focus on cognitive biases as a factor that has limited the success of previous information-based interventions. Specifically we will evaluate: 1) confirmation bias and 2) short-term consequences bias.    ,NCT00623090
Prostate Cancer,A Phase I Gene Therapy Study of FP253/Fludarabine for Prostate Cancer, The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy for prostate cancer. FP253 contains an ovine atadenovirus that expresses the E. coli enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) under the control of a prostate-directed promoter. PNP converts systemically administered fludarabine (the prodrug) into 2-fluoroadenine (the active agent) at the site where FP253 has been administered (the prostate). This localized conversion is expected to provide organ-targeted chemotherapy that should reduce the systemic side effects associated with classical chemotherapy and also reduce the risk of debilitating damage to tissues surrounding the prostate.    ,NCT00625430

This clinical trial will test if the Endothelin A Receptor Antagonist ZD4054 (Zibotentan) can improve progression-free survival and overall survival against a background of existing prostate cancer treatments. ZD4054 (Zibotentan) is a new type of agent which is thought to slow tumour growth and spread by blocking Endothelin receptor activity. This trial will look at the effects of ZD4054 (Zibotentan) in hormone resistant prostate cancer (HRPC) patients who have had rising PSA after surgical or medical castration but have no evidence of metastases. All patients participating in this clinical trial will receive existing prostate cancer treatments in addition to trial therapy. Half the patients will receive ZD4054 (Zibotentan)  and half the patients will receive placebo in addition to standard prostate cancer therapy. By participating in this trial there is a 50% chance that patients will receive an agent that may slow the progression of the tumour.

Prostate Cancer,Dissemination of Prostate Cancer Screening to PCP's in African American Communities, The aims of this project are to adapt and extend the use of academic detailing to the dissemination of prostate cancer (CaP) screening findings to primary care physicians practicing in African American communities. The objectives of this study are: 1. To test the hypothesis that a community physician-based educational intervention (multi-component academic detailing including an interactive digitized web-based program for informed decision-making about prostate cancer and patient education materials designed for low literacy patients) will increase physician knowledge positive attitudes/beliefs toward screening and screening options and prostate cancer screening (using the digital rectal exam and the serum prostate specific antigen test) at baseline 6- and 12-months post- randomization compared to the rate observed in a service- as-usual control. 1A. To demonstrate the feasibility of disseminating the American Cancer Society guidelines for prostate cancer screening among primary care practitioners using multi-component academic detailing. 2. To develop models predicting which physician offices are most and least likely to adopt the intervention and to generate hypotheses about tailoring the dissemination of PC screening guidelines to different physician subgroups. The long term goal of this project is to increase prostate cancer screening among African American communities thus decreasing cancer-related morbidity and mortality.    ,NCT00629330

Prostate Cancer,Bone Health Observational Study, Prostate Cancer patients treated with LHRH agonists (e.g. goserelin) lose Bone Mineral Density (BMD). Using a prospective observational study design we propose that monitoring how physicians manage Cancer Treatment Induced Bone Loss(CTIBL) in their patients. The gold standard for evaluating BMD is dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The proposed study will provide some of the first prospective data on the rates of Skeletal Related Events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT and help develop official guidelines on the use of DEXA screening for prostate cancer patients.    ,NCT00632905
Prostate Cancer,A Phase I/II Trial of 2-Deoxyglucose (2DG) for the Treatment of Advanced Cancer and Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer, Subjects will be asked to participate in this clinical trial to examine the safety of 2-deoxyglucose (an agent which is quite similar to glucose) in the treatment of solid tumors and hormone refractory prostate cancer. This agent works by blocking the metabolism of glucose in the cells of the body. Although all cells require glucose for metabolism it is believed that cancer cells require significantly more glucose than normal cells to grow. Therefore even slight effects of glucose metabolism in cancer cells might result in the shrinkage of certain cancers. This agent has been given to humans before and has only caused mild nausea vomiting and glucopenia (low blood sugar) at the doses given in these studies. This study will further examine the safety of 2-deoxyglucose in the treatment of advanced solid tumors and hormone refractory prostate cancer. The information obtained in this study will be used to design future clinical studies with 2-deoxyglucose. Subjects will be asked to take an oral solution of 2-deoxyglucose daily by mouth while on this study. They will be asked to have CT Scans Bone Scans and optional PET (Positron Emission Tomography) Scans prior to starting this study. PET scans will also be performed shortly after the start of the study and after 2 cycles (6 weeks) of therapy. Subjects will be asked to have a comprehensive physical examination and blood work prior to the start of the study. During the first 2 cycles of the study subjects will be asked to have blood drawn at different time intervals for the first 2 days of each cycle. While on the study they will be asked to return to the clinic at intervals of 1 week for a physical examination and blood tests. Subjects will also be asked to have CT Scans and Bone Scans at intervals of 9 weeks while on the study.    ,NCT00633087
Prostate Cancer,Satraplatin and Prednisone to Treat Prostate Cancer, Background: Satraplatin is an experimental drug that may be of benefit to patients with prostate cancer. Prednisone is approved for treating prostate cancer. The gene excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency complementation group 1 (ERCC1) helps repair cell damage caused by satraplatin. It is possible that patients who have a variant of this gene will not benefit from treatment with satraplatin because the drug will not be able to damage the cancer cells effectively. Objectives: To determine if satraplatin may help treat prostate cancer in patients with certain variants of the ERCC1 gene. Eligibility: Patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer whose disease has not responded to hormonal therapy or at least one type of chemotherapy and whose x-rays scans or other tests have shown their cancer to be spreading. Design: Participants have a blood test to determine if they have a variant of the ERCC1 gene. Participants take satraplatin by mouth every day for 5 consecutive days out of every 35 days and prednisone by mouth every day. These 35-day treatment cycles may continue for 6 months or longer depending on the benefits and side effects of the treatment. During the treatment period patients undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  Blood tests on days 1 of the treatment cycle.   -  Weekly blood draws for the first 3 treatment cycles.   -  Imaging studies (e.g. bone scans computed tomography (CT) scans) every two cycles to determine the response to treatment.   -  Surgical or medical suppression of testosterone in patients whose cancer cells continue to grow due to exposure to the hormone....    ,NCT00634647
Prostate Cancer,Contrast Enhanced Transrectal Ultrasonography (TRUS) to Assess Prostatic Vascularity After Radiotherapy (XRT), Solid tumors including prostate cancer commonly exhibit tumor-associated neovascularity (growth of new blood vessels to feed the tumor) with increased microvessel density. Systemic hormonal and radiotherapy treatments typically decrease or suppress tumor - associated vascularity through several mechanisms including apoptosis (process of cell death) and anti-angiogenic pathways (ways to destroy new blood vessel growth). Previously at the investigators' center they have demonstrated that increased prostatic vascularity (blood vessels defined to prostate) detected ultrasonographically correlated with disease free survival after radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of entire prostate) and may be indicative of higher grade higher stage disease. The significance of prostate neovascularity in response to treatment with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (standard of care) has not been well studied. The investigators hypothesize that prostate cancer that recurs after radiotherapy may exhibit measurable patterns of tumor-associated vascularity which may represent a minimally invasive marker of cancer stage grade and response to treatment. The investigators propose a pilot study to assess the feasibility of serial enhanced transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) examinations during and after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.    ,NCT00635167

Prostate Cancer,Androgen Suppression Therapy and Radiation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel in Treating Patients With High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy such as flutamide bicalutamide leuprolide buserelin and goserelin may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving androgen suppression therapy together with radiation therapy is more effective with or without docetaxel in treating prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying androgen suppression therapy radiation therapy and docetaxel to see how well they work compared with androgen suppression therapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer. CLOSURE: This trial closed to further accrual in November 2009. The study endpoints will not be reached.    ,NCT00651326
Prostate Cancer,Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I Stage II Stage III or Stage IV Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.

Prostate Cancer,Phase II Study of RAD001 in a Neoadjuvant Setting in Men With Intermediate or High Risk Prostate Cancer, The mechanisms responsible for the development of hormonal refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) have been elusive. Genetic inactivation/loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene occurs in 30-60% of advanced prostate cancers and in 20% of the localized form. Researchers hypothesize that PTEN loss is a landmark genetic event in prostate cancer progression into the fatal HRPC form. One consequence of PTEN loss is activation of the oncogenic Akt and phosphorylation of downstream Akt targets including mTOR. mTOR controls many important cellular processes including cell cycle regulation. We propose to evaluate pharmacodynamic assessments of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 in intermediate and high risk prostate cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Patients will be admitted to 6 weeks treatment with RAD001 10 mg/day followed by either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy combined with hormonal treatment. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies for phosphorylated p70S6K  pS6 Akt as well as antibodies for VEGF BCL2 and PTEN in prostate cancer tissues before and after 6 weeks RAD001 treatment will be performed. Additionally Patients will be evaluated by FDG-PET scan before (as baseline) and after RAD001 treatment. A link between mTOR signaling and glycolysis regulation was established and may provide a mechanism to assess drug-target interaction of RAD001 in prostate cancer. The secondary endpoint of the trial will be to determine the response proportion to RAD001 treatment by assessing time to biochemical failure followed by radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy. The data will be compared to a matched cohort of high and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients admitted to the same treatments modalities without receiving RAD001.    ,NCT00657982

Prostate Cancer,PSMA and TARP Peptide Vaccine With Poly IC-LC Adjuvant in HLA-A2 (+) Patients With Elevated PSA After Initial Definitive Treatment, Pilot Immunotherapy Study of Combination Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) and T-cell receptor γ alternate reading frame protein (TARP) Peptide With Poly IC-LC Adjuvant in Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA)-A2 (+) Patients With Elevated prostatic specific antigen (PSA) After Initial Definitive Treatment The purpose of the study is to see if the PSMA/TARP proteins in the vaccine along with the Hiltonol can arouse and train the immune system to kill the prostate cancer cells. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. males. It is curable when it is confined to the prostate (kept from spreading) using surgery or radiation treatments. In some patients the cancer can come back after these treatments. Treatment options for prostate cancer that comes back include procedures or medications which may have significant risks and side effects. Another plan is being looked at that uses the body's immune system to attack prostate cancer cells. A vaccine has been developed that has proteins found in prostate cancer cells. One of the proteins is called PSMA and the other is called TARP. In addition to these proteins another substance called Poly IC-LC (Hiltonol) will be added to the vaccine to boost its ability to start the immune system.    ,NCT00694551

Prostate Cancer,Vaccination of Prostate Cancer Patients With MUC-2-KLH Conjugate Plus the Immunological Adjuvant QS21, The purpose of this research is to help us study a vaccine treatment for patients with prostate cancer. A vaccine is a medicine that teaches the body to destroy harmful infections and other foreign substances. The immune system is made up of many different types of cells which fight infection and disease in your body. A vaccine may stimulate the immune system to destroy the cancer cells. It may also help to slow the growth of the cancer. The vaccine is a solution given as an injection given into or under the skin. It is made up of several parts. The first part is MUC-2 a protein present in many cancers especially prostate cancer. MUC-2 is attached to a material called KLH or keyhole limpet hemocyanin. KLH is purified from a snail- like marine mollusk called a keyhole limpet and has been used for many years to boost immune responses in animals and in people. Attaching MUC-2 to KLH helps the immune system react to MUC-2. The mixture of MUC-2 attached to KLH is in turn mixed with a material called QS21 from the bark of a tree which also helps the immune system to make more cancer- fighting cells. A vaccine like the one you will receive has been given to laboratory animals and been shown to produce an immune response in these animals.    ,NCT00698711

Prostate Cancer,Safety Study of Autologous Dendritic Cells Injected Into the Prostate After Cryoablation for Advanced Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this study is to determine if the intra-tumoral injection of a subject's own dendritic cells after cryotherapy of the prostate is a safe and effective treatment for advanced prostate cancer. In theory the injected dendritic cells will internalize antigens from the tumor cells which have been damaged by cryotherapy and activate the subject's immune system against that specific tumor. Subjects will also receive a low dose chemotherapy designed to lower the number of T-regulatory cells which have been shown to lower or stop some immune system responses. Hypothesis 1: Dendritic cell injection into cryotreated prostate cancer is non-toxic; Hypothesis 2: Dendritic cell injection into cryotreated prostate cancer is medically beneficial to the subject.    ,NCT00753220

Prostate Cancer,Informed Decision-Making Regarding Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Screening in 50-70 Year Old Latino Men, The purpose of this intervention trial is aiming to increase inform decision- making in Latino men regarding prostate cancer screening. The investigators propose to find out how much Latino men know about the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening and what factors influence how they decide whether or not to have screening. The investigators are also interested in learning how providing education information both verbally and in print about the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening affects men's interest and knowledge. The intervention is an interactive multi-media presentation made up of a small group of 8-10 Latino men gathered to discuss about prostate cancer screening methods treatment and the controversy within the medical community regarding PSA screening. A facilitator guides the 1-hour discussion and encourages participant interaction. The effect of this intervention was tested on 1000 Latino men within Los Angeles county. Participants were recruited from 38 community venues (churches community center etc.). All participants were interviewed before being randomized to receive written (control group) or oral (intervention) prostate cancer education material. All of the participants will be followed up at 6-months via a telephone interview. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention group will have an increase knowledge of prostate cancer will have increase communication with family friends and medical provider and will have an increase rate of PSA screening compared to the control group.    ,NCT00761124

Prostate Cancer,SPECT-CT Guided Lymphatic Mapping and Sentinel Lymphadenectomy (LM/SL) in Prostate Cancer, Nodal staging is a key-step in pre-treatment assessment of prostate cancer. In patients with a low probability of nodal metastasis bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy is controversial. The large majority of them (> 80%) are free of nodal disease in obturator and external iliac stations. On the other hand skip metastases located outside the standard lymphadenectomy may be missed particularly in more proximal nodal stations (i.e. common iliac nodes and pre-sacral nodes). In prostate cancer growing data indicate the potential utility of LM/SL particularly in patients with a low pre-test probability of nodal disease. However very few data have been reported on the feasibility and the utility of SPECT/CT following LM/SL. In a pilot study including 11 patients with prostate cancer Kizu and colleagues used a software image fusion from separate SPECT and CT studies. These authors concluded to the utility of image fusion to localize anatomically the SLNs. They also suggested the use of hardware fusion from a single gantry SPECT/CT device for accurate detection of SLNs. Accordingly Corvin and colleagues recently reported the suitability of sentinel node detection in a series of 28 patients with prostate cancer; in this study an integrated single slice SPECT/CT device was used to localize the SLNs. In the light of the encouraging data from literature and our own preliminary clinical experience we hypothesized that the use of integrated SPECT/low-dose multislice CT guided LM/SL may be of clinical interest in patients with prostate cancer.    ,NCT00773318

Drugs such as liothyronine sodium may protect the thyroid from the side effects of radioactive iodine. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gene therapy given together with radioactive iodine in treating patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer that did not respond to external-beam radiation therapy.    ,NCT00788307
Prostate Cancer,Fiducial Localization and Individualized Radiotherapy -Prostate Cancer, This purpose of this study is designed to compare two types of images; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Trans-Rectal Ultrasound (TRUS) to see which one performs more accurately for the image-guided insertion of Fiducial Markers(FMs) within the tumour. Though effective for guiding FM placement at the poles of the prostate gland due to excellent visualization of the prostatic boundaries TRUS may not be ideally suited for marking the GTV. Conventional TRUS is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for accurate visualization of intra-prostatic tumor. A new interventional MRI technique enables needle guidance to the gross tumour Volume (GTV) for FM placement. It is of particular importance that both techniques be evaluated to enable which one is more effective so that it can be implemented in the designs of future trials involving dose-escalation to prostate.    ,NCT00789607

Prostate Cancer,Clinical Study of SU011248 in Subjects With High Risk Prostate Cancer Who Have Elected to Undergo Radical Prostatectomy, Prostate cancer is prevalent in the United States with approximately 230110 new cases and 29900 deaths in 2004. Approximately 30% of new cases will be clinical stage T3 when they are diagnosed. This is a stage in which there is high probability that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland itself making it much more difficult to treat. In these cases when surgery is done by itself and the prostate is removed it is still very likely that some cancer that has spread beyond the prostate remains and will get worse. Radiation applied to the prostate also does not work well on tumors that have spread beyond the prostate. Even surgery and radiation combined have not eliminated the problems caused by prostate cancer that has spread into the tissue outside the prostate itself. New treatments are needed to deal with prostate cancer at this more serious stage. Study doctors believe that it might be possible to shrink the prostate cancer using a new drug called SUO11248 or Sunitinib. After the patients take the drug study doctors believe the cancer will shrink back to within the prostate and they can then surgically remove the prostate and all the cancer. Patients on this study also will be given increasing doses of Sunitinib to find out how much of the drug can be given safely.    ,NCT00790595
Prostate Cancer,Salvage Prostatectomy After Radiotherapy, The purpose of this study is to compare the location of the cancer found in the prostate gland after it is removed to the location that was predicted on the MRI scan during biopsy. In this way we can better determine if the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was accurate and if the MRI could be safely used to guide other types of treatments such as brachytherapy. We also plan to carefully measure how frequently surgery is able to completely remove the cancer as well as the side effects and effectiveness of surgery after radiotherapy. The study will be coordinated and closely integrated with a separate concurrent study of MRI-guided prostate biopsy which will be performed prior to accrual to this trial (UHN 05-0641-C).    ,NCT00791115
Prostate Cancer,Real Time Microscopic Imaging During Robot Assisted Prostate Cancer Surgery, The study involves use of a device called an endomicroscope to obtain high resolution images of microscopic structures during robot-assisted prostate cancer surgery.

Prostate Cancer,Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Detecting Cancer Progression in Patients With Early Stage Prostate Cancer Undergoing Active Surveillance, RATIONALE: Sometimes prostate cancer may not need treatment until it progresses. In this case active surveillance may be sufficient. Diagnostic procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging may be a less invasive method of finding prostate cancer that has progressed. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well magnetic resonance imaging works in detecting cancer progression in patients with early-stage prostate cancer who are undergoing active surveillance.    ,NCT00796874
Prostate Cancer,Cancer Support Programs, The goal of this research study is to learn if a support group program is acceptable for patients with prostate cancer or patients with breast cancer. Researchers also want to learn if the characteristics of the members of the support group program can have an effect on the quality of life of other members of the support group program. Support group programs will be conducted separately for prostate cancer patients and breast cancer patients.    ,NCT00798187
Prostate Cancer,Intraprostatic MAXimal Simultaneous Boost, This trial uses a type of radiotherapy called intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) which is able to deliver the radiation to the prostate while delivering less dose to the surrounding normal organs compared with standard 3D conformal radiotherapy presently used at the BCCA. This trial will use RapidArc IMRT which is a new way of delivering IMRT where the radiation dose is delivered in a single rotation of the radiotherapy machine around the patient. This new method of delivering IMRT has been shown to be at least as good as conventional IMRT at delivering the dose and takes less time to do so. The aim of this study is to deliver a higher radiation dose to the prostate gland than the standard treatment while not increasing dose to the normal organs. In this way it is hoped that the likelihood of the cancer coming back will be reduced without causing an increase in side-effects.    ,NCT00798837
Prostate Cancer,Low-Fat Fish Oil Diet for Prostate Cancer Prevention, Studies on patterns of how many men get prostate cancer in other countries show that environment contributes to the high incidence of prostate cancer in the United States. Epidemiology studies suggest that this influence may be reduced by the diet of men at risk of getting prostate cancer. Although the exact nature of the effects of diet are not completely known the amount of fat eaten appears to affect the number of men who get prostate cancer. The type of fat also seems to matter. Eating more of a type of fat called omega-3 polyunsaturated fat is associated with decreased prostate cancer risk. Omega-3 fat comes from fish and is quite different from the type of fat from animals and vegetables (omega-6 fat). Because the exact mechanism of this reduction in prostate cancer risk is not known no blood test indications called markers have been discovered that would show the effect working. Study doctors designed this study to try to find markers in the blood tests of men who have prostate cancer and to find out if a diet supplemented with omega-3 type fat from fish oil helps reduce those markers hence indicating that it helps reduce the cancer in these men. These men will be compared to men with prostate cancer whose diets do not contain the fish-oil fat. The men chosen will have prostate cancer and be scheduled for operations to have their prostate glands removed. They will be chosen randomly to be given the fish-oil diet or a regular Western diet for comparison for 4 to 8 weeks. Their blood will be checked at the beginning of the diet. After the 4-to-8-week period they will have their operations. Their blood will be checked again and a sample of their removed prostate will be examined to tell if the diet had any effect on the cancer and its markers.    ,NCT00798876
Prostate Cancer,Change in Penile Length Following Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy," Some men complain of changes in the shape or dimensions of their penis after undergoing radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate) for prostate cancer. Changes in penile dimensions include shortening or decreased girth. Changes in shape include a curvature or bending of the penis and/or the appearance of indentation. These changes may be associated with formation of scar tissue involving the covering of the erection chambers known as ""plaque"". The appearance of indurated plaque and a resultant curvature or indentation is a well described medical condition known as ""Peyronie's Disease"" and may occur in men who did or did not undergo radical prostatectomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate these changes in penile shape and dimensions.    ",NCT00800813

The study will be conducted in Doha Qatar at the Hamad Medical Corporation and Weill Cornell Medical College (Qatar). Individuals in the study population will be of Arab descent from Qatar. In this protocol researchers will survey epidemiologic factors and medical records of patients with prostate cancer in order to study the clinical characteristics of these individuals. The researchers will collect blood and tissue samples to evaluate the genetic characteristics of individuals with prostate cancer. The researchers will also collect blood samples of individuals without prostate cancer to serve as a control. The goal will be to identify genes that are associated with prostate cancer and gene profiles that are associated with differing prognoses in individuals who have prostate cancer.    ,NCT00801996
Prostate Cancer,C-11 Choline PET-CT Scan in Finding Metastases in Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures such as C-11 choline PET-CT scan may be effective in finding cancer that has spread to the bone and lymph nodes in patients with prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well C-11 choline PET-CT scan works in finding metastases in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk prostate cancer.    ,NCT00804245
Prostate Cancer,Study Assessing The Efficacy And Safety Of Avodart (Dutasteride) At Improving Urinary Symptoms In Men With Prostate Cancer Who Are Undergoing Seed Implantation, Avodart (dutasteride) reduces the male hormone (DHT) that leads to prostate growth and stimulates cancerous growth. Avodart is currently approved by the FDA to treat men with symptoms of an enlarged prostate. Avodart works by reducing DHT and prostate size; therefore the drug may be useful in improving lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as frequency urgency weak stream and urination difficulty (dysuria) among others in men with prostate cancer. Avodart may be effective in men with prostate cancer who are being treated with hormonal therapy with one injection of Zolodex (goserelin) followed one month later with a trans-urethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) and three months after that seed implantation (SI) of the prostate. The purpose of this study is to test whether Avodart (dutasteride) is effective on LUTS and dysuria in men with localized prostate cancer being treated with single-dose goserelin TUIP and interval SI.    ,NCT00805701
Prostate Cancer,Phase I Targeting Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion Using MR Spectroscopy and HDR Brachytherapy, This is a phase I study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using MRI/MRS to identify the dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL) and to selectively boost the lesion using inverse planned high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. The main objective is to exploit the ability of MRI/MRS to identify cancer regions within the prostate or the dominant intraprostatic lesions (DIL). The imaging data will be combined with the treatment planning CT images to define a treatment plan that will boost the dose delivered to the DIL up to 150% of the prescribed dose. Dose to the whole prostate and the dose delivered to adjacent organs will not change. This is accomplished by using inverse treatment planning software that can focus normally occurring high dose regions within the target volume to coincide with the DIL. After enrollment each patient will have a MRI/MRS before starting treatment. Hormonal therapy and external beam radiotherapy will be given based on current standard of practice. During HDR brachytherapy information about the location of tumor within the prostate will be used to design the brachytherapy treatment plan. We will try to increase dose to DIL by coincide existing high dose region on DIL using inverse planning software. Dose to prostate and adjacent structure will remain the same as the current treatment practice. Timing and the delivery of brachytherapy will not change from our current practice. After the treatment each patient will remain on study and follow for 12 months and treatment toxicity will be evaluated. A two-stage study design will be applied with a stopping rule for safety. Once a patient comes off study he will be routinely followed for disease outcome and any late toxicities.    ,NCT00807820

Prostate Cancer,Biomarker Study of Neoadjuvant Vitamin E in Patients With Locally Treatable Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this study is to find out if vitamin E can help treat prostate cancer. Vitamin E acts primarily as an anti-oxidant. By decreasing the oxidation in the cancer cell the tumor cells may die. Vitamin E is a commonly used vitamin that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in this type of cancer or for any known cancer. This study will test the hypothesis that vitamin E in the setting of an oxidative stress such as smoking can reduce prostate cancer related biomarkers in patients with localized prostate cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.    ,NCT00809458
Prostate Cancer,Hypofractionated Adaptive Image-Guided Radiation Therapy for Localized Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, This will be a Phase II study evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of a specific radiation therapy regimen. This choice of daily dose is based on the prior published experience showing safety and efficacy of hypofractionated regimens. The total dose is calculated to be effective for late effects which has been shown to be effective and safe in a large prospective Phase II study. If the hypothesis for the prostate is is true then this regimen should be at least as effective or more effective for tumor control than the current conventional therapy.    ,NCT00809991

Prostate Cancer,Radiation Therapy With or Without Goserelin and Cyproterone in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. This may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy such as goserelin and cyproterone may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body and reduces the amount of androgens available to the body. It is not yet know whether radiation therapy alone is more effective than radiation therapy given together with goserelin and cyproterone in treating patients with prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to giving radiation therapy together with goserelin and cyproterone in treating patients with prostate cancer that is at high risk for metastasis.    ,NCT00849082
Prostate Cancer,Two-Arm Study of a DNA Vaccine Encoding Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) in Patients With Non-Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer, The investigators are trying to find new methods to treat prostate cancer. The approach is to try to enhance patients' own immune response against the cancer. In this study the investigators will be testing the safety of a vaccine that may be able to help the body fight prostate cancer. The vaccine called pTVG-HP is a piece of DNA genetic material that contains genetic code for a protein that is made by the prostate gland called prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). The vaccine will be given together with a substance called an adjuvant. Adjuvants are typically given with vaccines and can improve the effect of the vaccine. The adjuvant that will be used in this study is called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The main purpose of this study is to find out whether the vaccine generates long-lived immune responses and whether a better schedule of vaccination can be found by doing frequent laboratory testing for immune responses. The investigators also want to see if the vaccine stimulates any immune reaction against cancer cells.    ,NCT00849121

The participants will start at 15 minutes per session and increase to a goal of 60 minutes per session. Men randomized to the resistance training treatment arm will participate in an eight-week program of eight strength training exercises three times per week. Men in the usual care arm will receive written materials from the American Cancer Society about coping with cancer which includes information about participation in physical activity. At the end of the eight week intervention participants in all three study arms will complete the same questionnaires and measurements they completed at baseline.    ,NCT00853164
Prostate Cancer,Exogenous Testosterone Plus Dutasteride for the Treatment of Castrate Metastatic Prostate Cancer, Usually the male hormone testosterone makes prostate cancer cells grow. Lowering testosterone usually stops the growth of prostate cancer. However after a period of time without testosterone prostate cancer cells learn to grow again. You are able to join this trial because your prostate cancer is growing even though you have very low levels of testosterone. Studies have shown that high doses of testosterone in this situation can cause prostate cancer cells to stop growing. The investigators did a study several years ago in which the investigators gave high doses of testosterone to patients such as yourself. The investigators showed that giving testosterone in this situation was safe. The investigators also showed that the investigators could in some cases make the PSA go down using high-dose testosterone. The investigators believe that they can improve this type of treatment by combining testosterone with another drug called dutasteride. Dutasteride is another type of hormone. It should make testosterone levels rise. The investigators believe that combination of dutasteride and testosterone will be more a more powerful regimen against your cancer than testosterone alone.    ,NCT00853697

Prostate Cancer,Radiotherapy - Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage, Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the most common curative approach offered to men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Unfortunately up to half of these patients will have factors placing them at high risk of their cancer recurring. Having radiotherapy after RP is known to improve cure rates but what is not known is whether it should be given straight after the operation or only when there is a rising PSA after surgery indicating active cancer. Immediate RT may not benefit all men and can cause serious side effects such as bladder and bowel problems and impotence. International lack of consensus on the optimal timing of RT has resulted in varied clinical practice. This phase 3 trial will compare the two approaches.    ,NCT00860652

Prostate Cancer,Dose Escalation Study Using Ultra-Hypofractionated Image-Guided Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer," The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new type of IG-IMRT called ""ultra-hypofractionated IG-IMRT"" where a higher dose of radiation is given to the tumor during each treatment day. Since higher doses of radiation are used each day the total number of treatment days needed to complete this type of radiation is only five instead of the 45-48 treatments currently used. Treatment takes place every other day and is complete after 2 weeks. If the patient decides to get this treatment they will come in for 5 treatments. This is different from the 48 treatments they would get normally.    ",NCT00911118

Prostate Cancer,An Efficacy and Safety Study With Licroca Depot a Controlled Release Product Injected Into the Prostate, The primary objective was to evaluate efficacy of a single dose of Liproca Depot in patients with localized prostate cancer. Primary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients showing PSA nadir. 24 Caucasian men with a mean age at inclusion of 68.4 years with localized prostate cancer were injected once with a ready made paste including 600 mg 2-hydroxyflutamide (Liproca Depot) into the site of the prostate where the tumour was localized. The patient was monitored for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for maximum 6 months or to progression within this time period. The primary endpoint showed interesting results with high success rate (83%) i.e. proportion of patients (Responders) that reached plasma PSA nadir.    ,NCT00913263
Prostate Cancer,Use of Hypothermia During Robotic Prostatectomy, Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RLP) has gained widespread acceptance as a standard treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer. Despite the enhanced visualization and precise dissection afforded by the robotic platform two major comorbidities affect a significant number of men: incontinence and erectile function. Urinary continence and erectile function It is commonly believed that the most important factor affecting continence is preservation of the external urinary sphincter complex which lies just below the prostate. Trauma to the urethral tissue itself after it is transected from the prostate and damage to the autonomic nerves that control this sphincter may lead to sphincteric dysfunction. In addition dissection of the bladder may lead to bladder irritability which also plays a role in incontinence. Surgical removal of the prostate also causes significant inflammatory damage to the pelvic floor which likely delays recovery of urinary continence. The same trauma issues apply to sexual function. One possible method to protect the nerves and other tissues from operative trauma may be the use of local hypothermia (cold-ischemia) to the pelvis. Local tissue hypothermia using ice ice slush or cold irrigation has been safely and routinely used for decades in humans during brain heart and kidney surgery to minimize organ damage. Yet this technique has never been applied to prostate surgery. We will accomplish local cooling of the pelvis using a cooling balloon inserted into the rectum. The cooling balloon is powered by an FDA approved cooling system developed by Innercool therapies. Temperatures of 57-86 degrees F (22+/-8 degrees C). References   1.

Prostate Cancer,Genomic Guided Therapy With Dasatinib or Nilutamide in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, This is a phase II multi-center study to determine the clinical impact of using a patient-specific genomic expression signature of androgen receptor (AR) activity to determine therapy for patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC). After patient eligibility is determined the genomic signature will be applied to fresh frozen tissue harvested from a metastatic lesion during image-guided biopsy. After assessing for androgen receptor activity the investigators will select patients for either continued androgen manipulation with nilutamide (high AR activity) or targeted therapy with dasatinib (low AR activity). Once patients develop a first progression on either arm patients will receive combination therapy with dasatinib and nilutamide. The primary aim is to estimate the median progression free survival in men with CRPC treated according to tumor AR activity. The investigators hypothesize that by treating men based upon AR activity median progression free survival (PFS) will improve from a historical median of 3.0 months to 6.0 months.    ,NCT00918385
Prostate Cancer,Androcur Non-interventional Study Among Patients With Carcinoma of the Prostate, Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is a steroidal antiandrogen which has affinity with progesterone and with glucocorticoid receptors. Cyproterone acetate is long-term proven effective treatment of inoperable carcinoma of the prostate. Sexual functions remain very important in men with prostate cancer. However sexual functions are deteriorating fast with course of the disease. The influence of CPA on sexual functions remains controversial. IIEF-5 erectile dysfunction questionnaire is currently widely used validated simple scoring system for diagnosing of erectile dysfunction and belongs to most used systems in Czech Republic. At present there are no data on CPA influence on IIEF-5 scored erectile dysfunction within the use of its indication in prostate cancer.    ,NCT00919022

Prostate Cancer,Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  Prostate cancers are difficult to see on most imaging studies such as X-rays computed tomography (CT) scans conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and conventional positron emission tomography (PET) scans.   -  An experimental radioactive tracer called 11C-acetate accumulates in prostate tumor cells and may help find prostate cancers more accurately than other imaging methods. Objectives:   -  To determine the accuracy of prostate tumor imaging using the tracer 11C-acetate. Eligibility:   -  Patients 18 years of age and older who are undergoing surgery for localized prostate cancer at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. Design:   -  Patients have a positron emission tomography (PET scan). For this test an intravenous (IV) line is placed in the patient's arm and the patient lies on a table inside the donut shaped scanner. (11)C-acetate is injected into the vein through the catheter and images of the lower pelvis and abdomen are obtained over 30 minutes.   -  Patients have an endorectal coil MRI scan. For this test a tube is placed in the rectum just behind the prostate to increase the amount of signal received by the magnetic resonance (MR) unit. Other coils may be wrapped around the pelvis to further improve the quality of the scan. The patient lies on the scanning table for about 75 to 90 minutes while images are obtained. During the scan a contrast agent called gadolinium is injected through an intravenous (IV) line to brighten the images.    ,NCT00924313

Prostate Cancer,Investigative Study of the Role of Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer Treatment, Surgery and irradiation for organ confined prostate cancer provide excellent long-term cancer control but they may be accompanied by a risk of side effects that decrease quality of life. Due to the stage migration of prostate cancer the potential for patients to undergo unnecessary treatment and the risk of treatment related morbidity has been increased.Alternative strategies that offer the possibility of delaying obviating or minimizing the impact of treatment maintaining the same oncological long term results have been investigated. Despite pros and cons active surveillance has not gained popularity in men with low risk prostate cancer as only 7% of men with localized prostate cancer remain in active surveillance. Traditionally solid tumors have been treated with radical surgery but selective organ sparing therapies are now common for tumors of the breast skin and kidney resulting in equivalent rates of cancer control lower morbidity rates and less disfigurement. With this in mind the potential role of focal ablative therapy for localized prostate cancer might be considered. The researchers will investigate the feasibility and the efficacy in term of quality of life and oncologic results of focal therapy by a pilot not randomized prospective study in a patients with localized prostate cancer who meet low risk criteria based on clinical biopsy and imaging data.    ,NCT00928603
Prostate Cancer,Modifications to Radical Prostatectomy: Feasibility Study," This study aims to determine whether surgeons at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are able to randomize patients to test modifications of surgery to remove the prostate. Surgery to remove the prostate is known as a ""radical prostatectomy"". Surgeons know many things about the best way to do a radical prostatectomy. However there is disagreement about some aspects of surgery. Two modifications of surgery to remove the prostate (radical prostatectomy) identified for this study include Irrigation and Fascial Suturing. Two aspects of the operation may vary fascial suturing and urethral irrigation. For each aspect surgeons will use their clinical judgment as to the best interests of the patient. In other words if there are clear reasons to use or avoid a fascial suturing approach the surgeon will act accordingly; similarly if there is a clear reason to irrigate or avoid irrigating the urethra the surgeon can make the appropriate clinical decision. If the surgeon is unsure as to which approach to take then the randomization scheme will be followed. All of the surgeons who are taking part in this study have used these techniques at different times. However they are unsure as to the best approach. Sometimes they use different treatments with different patients. Irrigation. Cancer cells can spill during surgery and this can cause cancer to return (""recur""). Some surgeons believe that ""irrigating"" could help stop spilling of cancer cells. ""Irrigating"" means washing the surgical area with sterile water and sucking the water back up through a tube. As a result surgeons vary as to how they irrigate. In this study we will examine irrigation of the urethra. This is the part of the body that carries urine from the bladder to the penis. Fascial suturing. Surgeons believe that what happens to the urethra can affect the risk of incontinence. This is when a patient cannot control urine and drips or leaks urine. One idea is that additional stitches (""sutures"") to the connective tissue (""fascia"") could be helpful but this is not known for sure.    ",NCT00928850

Prostate Cancer,Transrectal Ultrasound Imaging of the Prostate Gland and Neurovascular Bundles During Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy, Neurovascular bundle (NVB) contains capsular vessels to the prostate and cavernous nerves that provides the macroscopic landmark used during nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. The preservation of NVB during radical prostatectomy improves postoperative recovery of potency and continence. However the visualization of the NVB during radical prostatectomy can be challenging. Recently an attempt has been made to use a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging to delineate the anatomy of the prostate gland and NVB during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. However it is difficult to obtain a steady image of TRUS with an operator. The investigators plan to perform a feasibility study to obtain TRUS imaging of the prostate and NVB during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP). The investigators plan to use a robot-assisted TRUS probe holder to gently manipulate the probe to obtain steady TRUS images that may aid in visualization and dissection of the NVB during RALRP.    ,NCT00952666
Prostate Cancer,Vitamin D Supplementation in Veterans With Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, Vitamin D promotes the differentiation of prostate cancer cells maintains the differentiated phenotype of prostate epithelial cells and can induce prostate cancer cell death raising the possibility that vitamin D deficiency over time promotes the progression of subclinical prostate cancer to clinical disease. The investigators propose to conduct a clinical study aimed at measuring the efficacy of vitamin D3 (4000IU/day) supplementation in Veterans diagnosed with low-risk early-stage prostate cancer who elect to have their disease monitored through active surveillance. The successful completion of this proposed clinical study will allow us to determine whether correcting vitamin D deficiency in Veterans diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer will prevent progression of their disease and improve their prognosis.    ,NCT00953225
Prostate Cancer,Ketoconazole Hydrocortisone Dutasteride and Lapatinib (KHAD-L) in Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of giving ketoconazole hydrocortisone and dutasteride (KHAD) with lapatinib. The investigators believe that there is evidence in castrate resistant prostate cancer that two growth factor receptors (EGFr and Her 2 /neu )are increased in prostate cancer cells. Both these receptors are turned off by the drug lapatinib. By adding lapatinib to this trial the investigators hope that the investigators can turn off the signaling from the receptors and therefore make the participant's cancer more responsive to KHAD treatment.    ,NCT00953576

Prostate Cancer,Ultrasound-Guided Navigation in Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy, A new solution for guiding the surgeon in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is image-guided navigation using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). A TRUS-guided intraoperative navigation system using a robotic ultrasound probe manipulator (TRUS Robot) has been developed. The proposed research is a pilot clinical trial of the TRUS Robot and three-dimensional (3-D) navigation software to test its image-guidance ability of helping the surgeon during RALP. This is a dual robot approach a Tandem-RALP (T-RALP). The TRUS Robot allows a steady holding as well as remote manipulation of the TRUS probe. In addition the TRUS Robot can track the accurate position of TRUS probe which allows 3-D reconstruction of the images. While the intraoperative TRUS findings will not be used in surgical decision making in this trial the use of TRUS imaging during radical prostatectomy can potentially improve the visualization of the NVB and subsequently improve postoperative recovery of potency in men. In addition the 3-D reconstruction images of the prostate gland can potentially provide clear and accurate guidance of surgical landmarks to the surgeon..    ,NCT00956904

Prostate Cancer,Quantification of Respiratory-induced Prostate Motion, Patient anatomy and position during the course of radiation therapy can vary from those used for treatment planning; a function of patient movement uncertainty in positioning system and organ motion. Traditionally treatment margins are designed to compensate for interfraction prostate setup variability. This approach has the potential to lower the overall effectiveness of treatment because the prostate gland is a continuously moving target whose motion cannot be accurately accounted for solely on the basis of interfraction movement. More recently the dosimetric relevance of intra-fraction prostate motion has been recognized and may be compensated for by continuous real-time adaptive radiation therapy afforded by the Calypso 4D Localization System?? In the current study the investigators propose to characterize intrafraction prostate motion. The investigators hypothesize that intrafraction prostate motion is correlated with respiratory motion.    ,NCT00980993

Prostate Cancer,Prevention of Micro-architectural Bone Decay in Males With Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT), Less than 20% of men in whom prostate cancer is diagnosed early die from it. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in men with early prostate cancer. A commonly used form of treatment for prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT while effective for the treatment of prostate cancer has been linked to undesirable side effects such as an increased risk of bone fractures and diabetes. Bisphosphonates a class of drugs that prevent bone resorption have been show to reduce the loss of bone mineral density that occurs as a consequence of ADT but the effects of bisphosphonates on preservation of bone architecture is unknown. This project has two main goals: To assess prospectively in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT the effect of:   1. the intravenous bisphosphonate zoledronic acidon ADT-induced microarchitectural decay of bone structure.   2. ADT on insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. We will recruit 100 ambulatory men with non-metastatic prostate cancer who are about to commence a three year course of ADT as per routine clinical practice at Austin Health. Men will be randomised to receive either intravenous zoledronic acid (Aclasta Novartis Pharmaceuticals) or placebo at baseline and after 12 months of ADT. Men with contraindications to zoledronic acid will be excluded from the study. All 100 study subjects will have clinical and laboratory assessment at baseline and at 3 6 12 18 and 24 months (study end) and imaging studies at baseline and at 6 12 and 24 months.

Prostate Cancer,An Alternative to A Fixed Schedule In Management Of Prostate Cancer, The male sex-hormone called testosterone is known to play a key role in the growth of prostate cancer. The usual treatment for the disease involves suppression of hormones (testosterone) by anti-hormonal treatment for an unknown period of time until the cancer progresses. This anti-hormonal treatment usually consists of injections every three months with an LHRH(Leutinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone) agonist and a short course of anti-androgen pills which together help to lower the production of testosterone. Long-term hormonal treatment has potentially serious side effects and is expensive. In this study hormonal treatments will be with held from those patients eligible and willing to participate. The aim of this study is to see if we can decrease the amount of hormone injections that patients require. This might lead to a decreased side effects(such as decrease in bone health cardiovascular problems and metabolic syndrome which occurs when several health conditions happen at the same time and can lead to an increased risk of heart disease stroke and diabetes) as well as to decrease the cost of hormonal therapy to treat prostate cancer.    ,NCT01056562

Prostate Cancer,A Pilot Study of Parenteral Testosterone and Oral Etoposide as Therapy for Men With Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer," The objective of the study is to determine if men with evidence of progressive prostate cancer while on chronic androgen ablation of ??1 year duration will exhibit a clinical response following administration of parenteral testosterone and oral etoposide. Treatment Plan: Eligible patients will continue on androgen ablative therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (i.e. Zoladex or Lupron) if not surgically castrated. Patients will receive intramuscular injection with testosterone cypionate at a dose of 400 mg every month for a total of 3 injections (i.e. 3 months of therapy). This dose was selected based on data demonstrating that it produces an initial supraphysiologic serum level of testosterone (i.e. > 3-5 times normal level) with eugonadal levels achieved at the end of two weeks. Beginning the day of the testosterone injection patients will also receive oral etoposide 100 mg/day in divided doses (50 mg q 12h) x 14 days out of 28 days per cycle. After 3 months on therapy patients will have repeat prostate specific antigen (PSA) and bone/computed tomography (CT) scans to establish the effect of combined testosterone and etoposide treatment on these parameters (i.e. ""testosterone effect baseline""). Patients with sustained elevations in PSA ??50% above pre-testosterone treatment PSA levels after the initial three months of testosterone and etoposide therapy will not receive continued therapy and will come off study. Patients with PSA levels less than the peak serum PSA level seen over the three month period (PSA decline) or patients with PSA ??50% of pretreatment baseline will receive a second 3 month course of monthly testosterone and etoposide therapy until evidence of disease progression. Disease progression is defined as a PSA increase above the PSA level obtained after 3 months on testosterone treatment over two successive measurements 2 weeks apart or evidence of new lesions or progression on bone/CT scans compared to baseline studies. Patients who respond to initial treatment with testosterone and etoposide and then show signs of progression will have the option of retreatment with testosterone alone after a period of 3 months or greater off of the original therapy.

Prostate Cancer,Intracavernous Bone Marrow Stem-cell Injection for Post Prostatectomy Erectile Dysfunction, Erectile dysfunction is a frequent adverse event after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. It is the consequence of penile vascular damage mainly arterial insufficiency and venous leakage associated with fibrosis of the corpus cavernous. Apoptosis of penile cells including mesenchymal cells smooth muscle cells and endothelial is believed to play an important role in the pathophysiology of post prostatectomy erectile dysfunction. Bone marrow mononucleated cells (BMMNC) contain different cell types that may replace the damaged penile cells after radical prostatectomy. These are mainly: mesenchymal stem cells endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem cell. Intracavernous injection of BMMNC may therefore find application in the treatment of post prostatectomy erectile dysfunction. The aims of this phase I-II study is to test the safety of autologous intracavernous BMMNC injection and to evaluate benefit for the patient concerning recovery of natural erection. Patients with penile vascular abnormality (echo-doppler) and localized prostate cancer (considered as cured by radical prostatectomy) will be included in this study. Four different doses of BMMNC will be tested.    ,NCT01089387
Prostate Cancer,The Effectiveness of 18F-fluorocholine Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Detecting Staging and Following-up Prostate Cancer, Choline is one of the components of phosphatidylcholine an essential element of phospholipids in the cell membrane. Some malignant cells show their ability to actively incorporate choline to produce phosphocholine and phosphatidylcholine to facilitate tumor cell duplication. The efficacy of 18F-fluorocholine (18F-FCH) for localizing primary or metastatic prostate cancer has been recently reported in limited studies. This study will be conducted to delineate the effectiveness of 18F-FCH PET in (1) differentiating benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) from prostate cancer (2) staging prostate cancer (3) following-up patients with prostate cancer after initial curative therapy.    ,NCT01089881
Prostate Cancer,A Phase I/II Study of TRC105 in Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), Background:   -  Currently there is no curative therapy for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) a leading cause of death in men. However researchers are exploring new treatments that involve drugs that prevent angiogenesis (the process by which new blood vessels are formed) and can slow or prevent tumor growth.   -  TRC105 is an experimental drug that blocks angiogenesis and has been studied for possible use in treating different kinds of cancer. However it has not been validated to treat prostate cancer in general or CRPC in particular. Objectives:   -  To determine the effects of TRC105 as a treatment for CRPC   -  To determine the safety and effectiveness of TRC105 in treating CRPC Eligibility: - Men at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with castrate-resistant prostate cancer for which existing treatments have not been effective. Design:   -  Eligible individuals will have a series of blood and other tests to determine their suitability for participating in the study.   -  Participants will receive intravenous infusions of TRC105 in a 28-day treatment cycle. Participants will receive i.v. (intravenous) infusions of TRC105 every two weeks on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (cohorts 1 2 3 5 and 6) and every week on days 1 8 15 and 22 of each 28 day cycle (cohort 4).   -  Participants will receive different doses of TRC105 depending on when they enter the study up to a maximum tolerated dose or optimum treatment dose.   -  Frequent blood and urine tests will be performed during treatment as well as other tests of cancer progression as directed by the study doctors. Participants will receive medicines to help prevent possible adverse side effects of TRC105 such as allergic reaction to the drug.   -  Participants will continue treatment with TRC105 until they or the study team decides that the medication is not beneficial. No additional testing will be required unless participants discontinue the treatment because of side effects (which the study doctors will follow until the side effects are resolved).    ,NCT01090765

Prostate Cancer,Adoptive Transfer of Autologous T Cells Targeted to Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) for the Treatment of Castrate Metastatic Prostate Cancer (CMPC), This is a phase I study which will test the safety of different doses of the patients own immune cells which have been changed to help recognize and destroy the cancer cells. The investigators want to find out what effects good and/or bad it has on the body and on the prostate cancer. The immune cells (T cells) used in this study will be the patients own immune cells. They will be removed from the patients blood changed in the laboratory and then put back into their body. T cells help the body fight infections. These cells may also kill cancer cells in some cases. Right now the patients T cells are unable to kill the cancer cells. For this reason the physician will change the T cells by putting in a gene so that they may be able to better recognize and kill the prostate cancer cells. A gene is a portion of information which comes from the DNA and tells the cell what to do. This gene will be put into the patients T cells by a weakened virus. It is hoped that this approach will help the T cells recognize the prostate cancer tumor cells and possibly kill them. The investigators have found that T cells modified in this way were able to cure a cancer similar to Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in mice. However this is an entirely new treatment for prostate cancer and it is not known if it will have any beneficial or unexpected harmful effects.    ,NCT01140373

Prostate Cancer,Surgery Combined With Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy - Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IMRT-IGRT) in Locally-advanced Prostate Cancers, Standard treatment of locally-advanced prostate cancers consists in the association of radiotherapy of prostate and seminal vesicles (SV) and androgen deprivation (AD) for 3 years. This treatment is usually preceded by pelvic lymphadenectomy to assess the possible extension to lymph nodes of prostatic cancer and to avoid irradiating the pelvis in case of no lymph node involvement. However radiotherapy leads usually to about 30% of grade ?? risk of bladder and/or rectal toxicity. This risk particularly depends on the radiation volume. In the aim of lowering the toxicity the treatment in this study will associate:   -  pelvic lymph node dissection and resection of seminal vesicles allowing decreasing the radiation target volume to the prostate only (and not to irradiate the SV);   -  a high-precision radiotherapy technique combining Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT).    ,NCT01148069

Prostate Cancer,Spaced Education to Optimize Prostate Cancer Screening, Two memory research findings (the spacing and testing effects) can dramatically improve retention of learning but they have largely have been ignored by educators. The researchers have developed a novel form of online education (termed 'spaced education') based on these two effects which has been shown in randomized trials to improve knowledge acquisition and boost learning retention. Using prostate cancer screening as an experimental system the researchers investigated whether spaced education could durably improve clinicians' behaviors not just their knowledge.    ,NCT01168323
Prostate Cancer,FLAME: Investigate the Benefit of a Focal Lesion Ablative Microboost in Prostate Cancer, Rationale: Dose escalation in external-beam irradiation has proven to benefit outcome in local prostate cancer. Randomized trials were performed up to doses of 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Nevertheless the five-year biochemical relapse rate still was approximately 35% in the high-dose arm. Therefore further dose escalation seems to be required. A feasibility study up to appr. 85 Gy on the entire prostate has already been performed and showed acceptable toxicity when combined with adequate position verification. Higher doses to the entire prostate are expected to increase severe toxicity. As local recurrences only occur at the site of the primary macroscopic tumour area the next step in increasing the dose should be an ablative boost to the macroscopic tumour alone while electively irradiating the rest of the prostate to the current gold standard dose. Feasibility of this approach has been shown for an ablative dose of 95 Gy to the macroscopic tumour within the prostate.    ,NCT01168479

Prostate Cancer,Imaging of Residual Tumor During Prostatectomy, Prostate Cancer is the most common cancer in men affecting about as many men as women diagnosed with breast cancer and killing about as many men per year as breast cancer kills women. The most common surgical treatment is prostatectomy the removal of the prostate. During prostate surgery tumor remains at the edge of the surgery called residual tumor in 30% of all prostatectomies. Such patients have a significantly higher risk of local recurrence of the cancer and higher rates of death. In contrast even patients with cancer outside of the prostate but still nearby the prostate do better when the margins are made clean of tumor during surgery. The investigators propose to reduce the number of patients with residual tumor after surgery. The investigators will test in patients a fluorescent molecule that allows cancer to be detected during surgery. If this trial works as designed the investigators will reduce the number of patients who have to receive additional treatment such as high doses of radiation to the lower abdomen because the amount of residual tumor left behind has been minimized. This may also lead to higher rates of survival. This type of detection of cancer the investigators employ is called Molecular imaging. The investigators believe that molecular imaging will be the key to improved diagnosis individualized treatment selection and treatment monitoring. If successful a large human trial will be conducted after this study with a corporate imaging partner.    ,NCT01173146

The MRI and PET scans may be performed on the same day or on different days depending on the schedule set by the study researchers.   -  Tissue samples taken during prostate removal surgery including prostate tissue and pelvic lymph nodes will be collected for further study of the effectiveness of GE-148 (18F).    ,NCT01176513
Prostate Cancer,The Role of Social Comparisons in Coping and Quality of Life Following a Prostate Cancer Diagnosis, Social comparisons may function as a coping strategy but their role in coping and quality of life has not been well characterized. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the relationships between cognitive appraisals; coping strategies; social comparisons; and quality of life among men with prostate cancer. The conceptual framework for this study is drawn from Festinger s Social Comparison Theory Lazarus and Folkman s Transactional Model of Stress and Coping and Mishel s Uncertainty in Illness Theory. A cancer diagnosis is accompanied by uncertainty about how cancer will affect one s life. Theory and empirical data suggest that in conditions of uncertainty coping affects adjustment to a condition. Social comparisons have been postulated to be more prevalent in uncertain situations. Because little is known about how social comparisons operate participants in this study will be recruited exclusively from prostate cancer support groups. Support groups provide a context in which individuals are likely to make social comparisons and to be cognizant of these comparisons. Prostate cancer provides a model of a common chronic condition with complex etiology. Prostate cancer treatment may cause sexual urinary and bowel side effects which may affect patients quality of life and elicit attempts to cope. One way of managing the prostate cancer experience may be to compare oneself to others who are doing better or worse than oneself on relevant dimensions. The interpretation of social comparisons may positively or negatively affect one s perceived quality of life. There have been no studies among prostate cancer patients that have quantitatively measured the use of social comparisons. There is also a paucity of research in this population regarding the predictors of coping strategies and the predictors of quality of life across multiple domains. This study will use a cross-sectional mixed methods survey to investigate relationships between cognitive appraisals coping and quality of life and to qualitatively explore social comparisons among men with prostate cancer. Participants may complete the survey on paper or online. The primary outcomes are the use of coping strategies including social comparisons and quality of life. Individuals with a personal or family history of prostate cancer are currently seen by genetic counselors as part of research studies investigating the genetic basis of prostate cancer. If relationships are demonstrated between the social comparisons and quality of life genetic counselors may want to assess patients social comparisons to evaluate how patients are coping with their condition.    ,NCT01176526

Prostate Cancer,Efficacy and Safety Study of LE-DT to Treat Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer, LE-DT is a novel proprietary delivery system of docetaxel developed by NeoPharm Inc. Docetaxel (currently marketed as Taxotere) is an anti-microtubular network agent and is one of the most active agents in the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and other variety of cancers. Taxotere has poor solubility and is designed to be administered with Tween 80 in ethanol. This vehicle causes acute hypersensitivity reaction. By removing toxic detergent used in Taxotere the form of LE-DT shows reduced toxicity and comparable therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical study. The clinical evidence obtained from the NeoPharm Phase I study shows fewer side effects and possibly administered at higher dose to induce greater effectiveness of LE-DT. The current Phase II study is designed to accomplish the following objectives:   1. Assess the antitumor effect indicator serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) following the intravenous (IV) administration of 110 mg/m2 LE-DT every three weeks in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer   2. To evaluate the measurable soft tissue disease response using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumor (RECIST) methodology   3. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)   4. To correlate PSA expression with tumor response   5. To evaluate the safety of LE-DT at 110 mg/m2 level in particular peripheral neuropathy water retention as well as myelotoxicity   6. To evaluate the quality of life (QOL)    ,NCT01188408

Prostate Cancer,Metformin in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, Metformin is a medication that is prescribed for people with diabetes to help the body respond better to its own insulin and decrease sugar production by the liver. This helps control the body's blood sugar level and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of diabetes. Participant's in this research study will already be receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer. ADT is considered standard of care for prostate cancer. Changes in the participant's metabolism including changes in insulin and blood sugar levels are often seen as a result of this type of hormone therapy. Some studies have shown a relationship between insulin and prostate cancer. These studies have suggested that insulin may signal tumor cells to grow. Other studies suggest that people receiving metformin treatment for diabetes may enjoy better outcomes from their prostate cancer then other similar patients who are not treated with metformin.    ,NCT01215032

Prostate Cancer,Changes in Brown Adipose Tissue Activity In Men Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer, Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is considered standard of care for prostate cancer. However changes in the patients metabolism are usually seen as a result of hormone therapy. These changes include increased fat mass decreased lean mass weight gain high blood cholesterol increased incidence of diabetes and possibly increased incidence of cardiac events such as heart attack. The researchers of this trial would like to learn if these change in body mass are affected by the presence of brown fat in the body. Brown fat is made up of fat cells that are stored in the body and generate heat to control body temperature. Levels of brown fat are at the highest in newborn babies and decrease over time into adulthood. The researchers of this trial would like to learn more about these changes in metabolism during prostate cancer treatment by studying the changes in brown fat during the first 12 months of hormone therapy.    ,NCT01226888

Prostate Cancer,CT-validation of Ultrasound Based Planning for High Dose Rate (HDR) Prostate Brachytherapy Using Vitesse, High Dose Rate (HDR) temporary prostate brachytherapy offers a precise form of dose escalation for prostate cancer. Needles are placed the position is confirmed and treatment is delivered. Previously High Dose Rate prostate brachytherapy was performed under TransRectal UltraSound (TRUS) guidance but planned with Computed Tomography (CT) imaging which introduced a source of error through needle displacement while transporting and repositioning patient. Recently Varian has introduced a one-step procedure where both implant and planning are based on UltraSound imaging and performed without patient repositioning. This planning system is approved by Health Canada and is commercially available. This study will use High Dose Rate brachytherapy to treat 15 men. Treatment will be planned with TransRectal UltraSound but validated pre-treatment using Computed Tomography imaging.    ,NCT01248741
Prostate Cancer,Docetaxel Followed by Radical Prostatectomy in Patients With High Risk Localized Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this research study is to determine if the combination of chemotherapy and hormone therapy is safe and helpful for patients who plan to have their high-risk prostate cancer surgically removed. Some physicians believe that patients with high risk cancer that is located in one area may have an early but small spread of the cancer outside of the prostate and perhaps even to distant organs. Therefore better treatments for the entire body are needed to improve the ability of surgery or other local therapies to cure prostate cancer. Since chemotherapy is beginning to demonstrate increasing activity in advanced prostate cancer patients it is possible that using chemotherapy combined with hormonal therapy earlier in the course of localized but high risk patients might improve the outcomes for these patients.    ,NCT01250717

Prostate Cancer,Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of using radiation therapy with 5 fractions of radiation to treat prostate cancer with guidance of radiation using the Calypso 4D Treatment System (Calypso).A number of recent studies have used 5 radiation fraction to treat prostate cancer over 2-3 weeks as compared to the typical treatment which would involve 40-42 smaller radiation fractions over 8-9 weeks. This type of radiation using a smaller number of treatments has been called hypofractionated radiation therapy. The Calypso is a new technique which uses beacons implanted into the prostate which using radio signals are able to localize and track the position of the prostate continuously during radiation therapy. The Calypso system has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for guidance of radiation therapy during the treatment of prostate cancer and is being utilized all across the United States. However it has not been tested for hypofractionated radiation therapy.    ,NCT01288534

Prostate Cancer,Effectiveness of Open and Robotic Prostatectomy, Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men. Surgical removal of the entire prostate (prostatectomy) is one option among the various ways to treat prostate cancer. The use of robot assistance for prostatectomy has become common place but its effectiveness has not been compared to standard open prostatectomy in trials carried out at more than one medical institution in which participants are identified and followed forward in time. Robot assisted and standard open prostatectomy health related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes have not been compared in a prospective multi-centered study. Prostatectomy can have side effects that can change with time. This research study seeks to determine how common and how long-lasting such side effects are; to find out what features of individual men's cancers and what features of the treatments affect those side effects. This study also seeks to identify factors that affect the quality of prostate cancer care by looking at how satisfied men are with their prostate cancer care. Through these findings this study aims to allow treatment side effects to be anticipated more accurately for individual patients and to provide a means for determining the quality of prostate care.    ,NCT01325506

Prostate Cancer,Assessing DNA Changes in High Risk Prostate Cancer to Determine Prognosis, One of the biggest problems facing prostate cancer patients and their treating physicians is who needs to be treated and when. Common clinical and pathological parameters are useful (PSA Gleason score etc.) but do not clearly predict who will benefit from treatment and who will fail. Genetic markers for tumor aggressivity would be of greater value. The finding that the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion is associated with an increase risk of cancer progression is important. TMPRSS2 is controlled by androgen (testosterone) and ERG is part of a family of proteins which have a role in controlling cell growth cell specialization and producing tumors. As a consequence of this gene fusion production of the ERG protein increases in the presence of testosterone and could be key to the development of prostate cancer resistance to treatment and poor outcome. The PTEN gene is known to have a role as a tumor suppressor. Its deletion is a contributing factor in the development of prostate cancers and poor outcome. The coexistence of the two markers could be associated with a higher risk of recurrence. To date there have been no studies regarding the presence of either of these two markers or their coexistence in high risk prostate cancer patients who despite radiation therapy and androgen suppression develop biochemical failure (their PSA levels rise once again). Patients participating in the PCS IV study (high risk prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy plus either 18 or 36 months of hormonal suppression) who have had biochemical failure or 3 years of follow-up post hormonal therapy will be approached. Tumor blocks from consenting patients will be collected and analyzed for the presence of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and the PTEN deletion at the Pathology Department of the Jewish General Hospital. Statistical analysis will be carried out to see whether either or both markers are present whether they are associated with certain clinical and pathological high risk factors and whether they can be used to predict which patients will fail treatment.    ,NCT01350180

Prostate Cancer,Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer Patients Switched to Degarelix Therapy After Failing on GnRH Agonists, This Phase IV observational trial is intended to identify patients who are failing GnRH agonist therapy as evidenced by a rising PSA and who have yet to initiate secondary manoeuvres involving antiandrogens. This group may include both non-metastatic as well as metastatic patients. The trial will determine if these patients will benefit from switching to Degarelix. It will assess the effect of Degarelix's direct mode of action on androgen levels and whether continuous use of Degarelix improves disease progression. As per the CUA Guidelines for the Management of CRPC because the androgen receptor remains active in most patients who have developed castration resistant disease it is recommended that ADT should be continued (LEVEL 3 GRADE C). Therefore it is logical to continue patients on Degarelix throughout the castrate resistant period. This will allow for the gathering of data that is currently unknown within this setting such as the effect of combined treatment with antiandrogens as well as chemotherapy and other castrate resistant treatments.    ,NCT01366053
Prostate Cancer,Effects of Anesthetic Technique on Immune and Inflammatory Systems Following Radical Prostatectomy, Several recently published retrospective studies show that regional anaesthesia (RA) can reduce cancer-related mortality following surgical treatment of colorectal breast and prostate cancers and malignant melanoma. If these results are true then the choice of perioperative pain management is as beneficial or even better than the current oncological therapies. This theory needs to be investigated in a prospective randomized and controlled trail. We shall perform a prospective randomized study comparing the effects of Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) or patient controlled analgesia (PCA) on postoperative immunological and inflammatory markers in order to understand whether the protective effects if any of regional analgesia are due to changes in these markers or whether the underlying mechanisms is not mediated via this stress signalling pathway.    ,NCT01367418

Prostate Cancer,MR Image Guided Therapy in Prostate Cancer, Background: - One way to treat prostate cancer is to use a laser to direct extreme heat to a small area of the prostate. The heat destroys tumor cells but does not affect healthy tissue. Doctors want to see if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to improve this treatment. MRI will be used to help locate tumor cells and guide the laser during surgery. However MRI-guided laser therapy has not been used to treat many people with prostate cancer. More studies are needed to see whether it can destroy tumor cells permanently. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of treating prostate tumors with laser therapy guided by magnetic resonance imaging. Eligibility: - Men at least 18 years of age who have prostate cancer that can be seen with an MRI and has not spread to other parts of the body. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood tests and imaging studies and will complete questionnaires about their health.   -  Participants will have the MRI-guided laser treatment in the hospital. The doctor will use the MRI to control how much energy is delivered by the laser and how much tissue is destroyed. The entire procedure usually takes from 1.5 to 3 hours.   -  After the treatment participants will have a catheter put in to keep the bladder emptied. The catheter will stay in for 1 to 7 days. Drugs to prevent infection and bladder spasms will be given. Participants will leave the hospital once they are well enough to go home.   -  Participants will have followup visits 3 6 9 12 18 24 and 36 months after the therapy. They will have physical exams and blood and urine tests. They will also answer questionnaires. Participants will have MRI scans 6 12 24 and 36 months after the therapy. They will have a prostate biopsy to see if there is any tumor every 12 months for the first 2 years. Another biopsy may be done in the third year.    ,NCT01377753

Prostate Cancer,Conventional Ultrasound for Imaging of Prostate Cancer Extent and Response in Human Cancer Patients, In this observational study the investigators will undertake imaging studies on men with prostate cancer. The primary hypothesis is that ultrasound spectroscopy could be used to determine the extent of disease inside and outside of the prostate gland in patients with prostate cancer. It is hoped that the changes in ultrasound backscatter parameters obtained before radical prostatectomy could be used to correlate with pathological findings from the prostate specimen after surgery.    ,NCT01401972
Prostate Cancer,Trial of Modifications to Radical Prostatectomy," This study aims to determine how different ways of performing prostate cancer surgery affect patient outcomes such as recurrence of cancer or regaining control of bladder function (continence) after surgery. Surgery to remove the prostate is known as a ""radical prostatectomy"". Surgeons know many things about the best way to do a radical prostatectomy. However there is uncertainty about some methods of surgery. All of the surgeons who are taking part in this study have used these techniques at different times. However they are unsure as to what is the best approach. This trial will evaluate whether the following two aspects of surgical technique influence outcome: Lymph node template. Prostate cancer can sometimes spread to the lymph nodes near the prostate. Surgeons often remove these lymph nodes to make sure that no cancer is left in the body. However there is uncertainty about which lymph nodes to remove (the ""template""). In particular not all surgeons think that it is important to remove a large number of lymph nodes. Some believe that prostate cancer found in the lymph nodes is not aggressive. As a result these surgeons feel that removing additional lymph nodes does not improve the chance that a patient will be cured. In the study patients will either have the standard lymph node dissection or a modified approach. Port site incision. Some surgeries are conducted with the help of what is called a surgical ""robot"" or using a laparoscopic approach (sometimes known as ""keyhole"" surgery). The surgeons have to make small cuts (""incisions"") in order to insert their surgical instruments. Some surgeons believe that the way in which this cut is made can affect the chance that a patient will develop a hernia in the months after surgery. This is when tissues in the abdomen protrude through the incision creating a small bulge that has to be surgically corrected. In the study patients will either have the incision made vertically or horizontally. Antibiotics. About a week after surgery you will return to the hospital to have your catheter removed. To guard against the chance of infection you will be given antibiotics. These do help prevent infection but are also harmful. Doctors are unsure whether to give a short course of antibiotics or whether patients really need several days of treatment.

Prostate Cancer,Prostate Cancer Survivors Moving Toward Exercise (PROMOTE) Trial, The primary purpose of the study is to determine the effects of an implementation intention intervention on physical activity (PA) behaviour in prostate cancer survivors. Secondary aims are to (a) compare the effects of a telephone-assisted implementation intention intervention against a self-administered implementation intention intervention and a standard recommendation group on physical activity behaviour and (b) document the effects of these interventions on quality of life (QoL) fatigue symptom management and physical functioning. Hypotheses: Evidence exists that an implementation intention intervention can lead to significant improvements in PA levels and that regular PA has been shown to improve QoL fatigue levels manage symptoms and improve physical functioning in cancer survivors'. As such the following hypotheses were generated: (1) prostate cancer survivors exposed to the researcher-assisted implementation intention intervention will have higher PA levels at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups compared to the self-completed implementation intention intervention and the standard recommendation group; (2) prostate cancer survivors in the researcher-assisted implementation intention intervention will show significant improvements in QoL fatigue levels symptom management and physical functioning compared to the self-completed implementation intention intervention and the standard recommendation group at the 1- and 3-month follow-up; and (3) prostate cancer survivors in the self-completed implementation intention intervention will have higher PA levels and better improvements in QoL fatigue levels symptom management and physical functioning compared to the standard recommendation group at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups.    ,NCT01410656

Prostate Cancer,A Phase I Trial of MRI-Guided Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose Radiotherapy For Prostate Cancer, The hypotheses of this study are:   1. Delivery of single fraction Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose (LEAD) radiotherapy (RT) to the dominant tumor lesion(s) in the prostate as identified by multiparametric functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging is safe and feasible.   2. Biomarker expression levels differ in the functional MRI identified suspicious tumor regions and unsuspicious tumor regions. The investigators hypothesize that a significant source of variation in biomarker levels is due to tumor heterogeneity and that it is molecular abnormalities in the dominant tumor areas that are angiogenic and determine outcome.    ,NCT01411319
Prostate Cancer,A Phase III Trial of Hypofractionated External Beam Image-Guided Highly Targeted Radiotherapy: The HEIGHT Trial, 1.

Biomarker expression levels differ in the DCE-MRI enhancing and non-enhancing tumor regions.   3. 10-15% of men undergoing RT have free circulating DNA (fcDNA) or tumor cells (CTC) that are related to an adverse treatment outcome.   4. Prostate cancer-related anxiety will be reduced in the MRI targeted SRT arm because the patients will be aware that the dominant tumor will be targeted with higher radiation dose.    ,NCT01411345
Prostate Cancer,Spectro-IRM and Evaluation Response to Prostatic Radiotherapy, Context: Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in European and North-American men. After external radiotherapy or brachytherapy the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) value is often fluctuating and PSA nadir may only be reached after 2 years or more and may remain detectable several years after the completion of radiation. Moreover PSA bounces and blips render patients and physicians very anxious about any possibility of a relapse. In this context biomarkers that could predict the response to radiation earlier than PSA for patients with prostate cancer appear long overdue. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy at 3 Tesla without endorectal coil is a non invasive procedure which allows quantification of metabolites such as Choline Creatine Polyamines and Citrate within the prostate gland. Objectives: The investigators are conducting a French prospective study on the Evaluation of the Response to Irradiation with MR Spectroscopy (ERIS). Their purpose is to monitor the early response of radiation with 3D MR Spectroscopy during the first year after completion of radiation and its impact on biochemical control. Therefore the ERIS trial aims to investigate whether or not there could be a correlation between the time course of PSA and that of Choline and Citrate.    ,NCT01412853

Prostate Cancer,Efficacy and Safety of Leuprolide Acetate 22.5 mg Depot in Treatment of Prostate Cancer, Some patients with prostate cancer benefit from androgen deprivation therapy which reduces levels of testosterone. Leuprolide is a synthetic Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue which upon administration can decrease testosterone levels to ??.5 ng/mL. Leuprolide Acetate 22.5 mg Depot is a microencapsulated formulation of leuprolide which is released slowly over time and effectively reduces testosterone levels in many patients to ??.5 ng/mL for up to three months. In this study Leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg Depot will be administered by intramuscular injection twice over a period of 6 months. The proportion of patients with testosterone ??.5 ng/mL evaluated over a period of 168 days.    ,NCT01415960
Prostate Cancer,Biodistribution and Pharmacokinetic Study of 18F-DCFBC Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Based PET in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States. Through early detection and improved local therapies a large number of men will be cured. The clinical needs include early detection accurate initial staging and detection of local recurrence or metastases in order to permit application of the most appropriate therapy. Therapeutic monitoring and prognostic assessment are equally important. Imaging can play an important and crucial role in meeting these clinical needs. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has gained an important role in the clinical management of cancer patients. 18F-DCFBC is a novel low molecular weight prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based radiopharmaceutical which is radiolabeled with a fluorine-18 positron emitter for PET imaging. Preclinical mouse prostate cancer tumor model imaging studies of 18F-DCFBC demonstrate high specific uptake in PSMA expressing prostate cancer cells. The investigators will assess the hypothesis that 18F-DCFBC a new positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical may possess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that will represent an advance in imaging prostate cancer. This initial phase I study will determine the biodistribution pharmacokinetics and prostate specific tumor uptake in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.    ,NCT01417182

Prostate Cancer,PROstate Cancer Imaging Treatment and Toxicity (PROCITT), This is a single centre prospective observational noninterventional study of men with histological confirmed prostate cancer high risk disease and not positive for metastatic disease planned to receive Radiotherapy and 18 months of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT). Although ADT improves the chance of cure it can also have many side effects. One of these is bone mineral density loss. When this is advanced it is called osteoporosis. Men with osteoporosis have a higher chance of getting fractures of bones such as the hip and spine. Currently the best way to measure for osteoporosis is to do a bone mineral density scan using a DEXA scanner. The primary objective of this study is to see if baseline Magnetic Resonance Imager (MRI) and a Computer Tomogram (CT) combined with clinical factors predicts which men are at greater risk of accelerated ADT induced bone mineral density loss than baseline DEXA scanning alone. The data from the patients will be used to construct a model predicting annual rate of bone loss based on baseline imaging clinical and biochemical characteristics. Secondary aims for this study are as follows:   -  Evaluating the feasibility toxicity (acute and late) and efficacy (5 year biochemical control by the Phoenix definition)of multimodality therapy with hypofractionated radiotherapy (giving a larger dose of radiotherapy over a shorter time 5½ weeks compared with a standard 8 week approach). Although used overseas this 5½ week regimen has not been used widely in Australia and we would like to see if we gain similar results here as have been reported from the US.   -  Feasibility and efficacy of a risk adapted duration of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Usually ADT is given for between 19 months before radiotherapy is started but there is no agreement as to which duration is best. This trial aims to tailor the duration of ADT prior to radiotherapy based on blood PSA test results.   -  Prognostic value of circulating tumour cells (CTCs). This is a blood test which can detect cancer cells in the blood which has been used for patients with metastatic cancer. The presence of CTCs in men with prostate cancer correlated with poorer overall survival. Potentially high risk prostate cancer patients with CTCs detected may represent a very high risk group and could therefore warrant treatment intensification.   -  To correlate bone marrow changes on MRI with changes in blood counts and patient reported fatigue. Measuring bone marrow may help in predicting not just which patients are at risk of losing bone faster but also of becoming anaemic and suffering fatigue. A correlation may better explain some of the toxicities associated with ADT.   -  Implementation of a nomogram based radiotherapy target delineation algorithm. This trial aims to use a decision making tool called a nomogram to help tailor the area to treat in a more standard way.    ,NCT01418040
Prostate Cancer,Cabazitaxel With Radiation and Hormone Therapy for Prostate Cancer, This is a single-center open-label non-randomized Phase I study of weekly Cabazitaxel with concurrent intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) (A type of 3-dimensional radiation therapy that uses computer-generated images to show the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities are aimed at the tumor from many angles.) and androgen deprivation therapy (Treatment to suppress or block the production or action of male hormones) in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. It is hoped that by adding Cabazitaxel to the standard IMRT greater local disease control can be achieved and eventually the cure rate can be increased. After this study the maximally tolerated dose of Cabazitaxel that could be used in combination with radiation can be found. Men with locally advanced high risk prostate cancer represent a group of patients for whom cure is potentially achievable utilizing a multimodality approach. More aggressive treatment upfront with chemotherapy and ADT may improve the long term disease control. We hypothesize that Cabazitaxel may be added to radiation therapy safely and we anticipate that this novel approach will improve disease control and eventually improve survival for locally advanced prostate cancer patients.    ,NCT01420250

Prostate Cancer,Phase 3 Study of ProstAtak® Immunotherapy With Standard Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ProstAtak® immunotherapy in combination with radiation therapy for patients with intermediate-high risk localized prostate cancer. ProstAtak kills tumor cells and stimulates a cancer vaccine effect. Killing tumor cells in an immune stimulatory environment induces the body's immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells. ProstAtak has shown synergy with radiation without added toxicity and lower than expected recurrence rates in previous clinical trials. The hypothesis is that ProstAtak can lead to improvement in the clinical outcome for patients with prostate cancer. Participants will be randomized to the ProstAtak or control arm at a 2:1 ratio. Both arms receive standard external beam radiation therapy. Short-term androgen deprivation therapy may be given but is not required.    ,NCT01436968

Eligibility: - Individuals with cancer who are being treated at the National Cancer Institute. Design:   -  Participants will provide a blood sample for study.   -  Participants who have blood-based cancer such as leukemia will provide a cheek swab sample.   -  If the blood or cheek swab sample does not have enough genetic material for analysis an additional sample may be collected.    ,NCT01441089
Prostate Cancer,Hypofractionated Dose Escalation Radiotherapy for High Risk Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, In North America around a quarter a million men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year and about 31000 patients will die of their disease each year. Like other western countries the incidence in Canada has increased due to an aging population and prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening. This has led to a significant demand on cancer care services for these patients. Prostate cancer patient with high risk features are more often treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) plus two to three years of hormonal manipulation (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist). The most common radiation dose treatment for these patients is 74-78 Gy in 37-39 daily fractions of 180-200 cGy for a treatment length of 7.5 weeks. This fraction size is believed to offer the best balance between desired tumour kill and unwanted normal tissue injury. Larger fraction sizes of more than 250 cGy (hypofractionation) are usually avoided for curative therapy because late reacting normal tissues. However prostate cancer cells have a unique radiobiology characteristic that suggests that hypofractionated radiotherapy is more efficient at prostate tumour killing than standard fractionation is and will produce equivalent tumour control with a lower total dose and a shorter overall treatment time. Improved target localization techniques and conformal radiation therapy technology have allowed for dose escalation and hypofractionated radiation delivery in these circumstances with minimal or no increased toxicities. This trial is designed to determine whether high risk prostate cancer patients can be safely treated with a dose escalation hypofractionated radiation therapy in 5 weeks as opposed to the usual 7-8 weeks. These patients will be randomized to either the usual 76 Gy in 38 fractions or 68 Gy in 25 fractions. 3D-Conformal Radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) will be used to deliver the required radiation dose. Patients will also receive 28 months of androgen deprivation therapy (LHRH agonist). The primary outcome of the study is the acute and delayed toxicity and the secondary outcomes include biochemical failure prostate specific mortality rate bone metastases free survival the prognostic and predictive value of several biological variables: presence of the PTEN deletion; expression of FoxP3 gene variants topoisomerase 2α and cancer testis antigens; expression of X chromosome-linked micro-RNAs; presence of TMRSS2-ERG gene fusion and quality of life. It is planned to recruit 250 patients to this study.    ,NCT01444820
Prostate Cancer,Feasibility and Toxicity of Degarelix for Prostate Downsizing Prior to Permanent Seed Prostate Brachytherapy, This study will investigate the efficacy of Degarelix a Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH) antagonist to reduce prostate volume prior to permanent seed prostate brachytherapy. There are 2 eligible populations of men all of whom will have selected brachytherapy as their treatment of choice for their prostate cancer. Either they have an enlarged prostate that requires size reduction to render brachytherapy technically feasible or they require androgen ablation in conjunction with brachytherapy for optimal tumor control. The hypothesis is that Degarelix will provide > 30% volume reduction by 3 months in > 30% of men.    ,NCT01446991

Prostate Cancer,Biopsy Study Comparing MRI and Ultrasound Soft Image Fusion Guided Biopsies and Gold Standard Prostate Biopsies., Background: Prostate biopsies are usually performed due to accidentally discovered elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy is standard procedure but possibility for precise documentation concerning the localization of the biopsies are lacking. Therefore the same locations might be subject to multiple negative biopsies. There is a growing confidence that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate gland can identify significant high-grade tumours and studies have shown value in performing MRI before biopsies. Because image documentation is lacking it is not possible to know which region actually being biopsied with conventional TRUS biopsy. MRI and 3D ultrasound soft image fusion guided biopsy is a new promising method that will ascertain all regions of the prostate gland to be biopsied and it is possible to perform accurate targeted biopsies when combined with MRI. Aims of the study Compare the biopsy results in the two groups:   1. To evaluate the overall rate of positive biopsies.   2. To evaluate the rate of re-biopsies.   3. To evaluate the detection rate of Gleason grade 4 and 5 tumours.   4. To evaluate the rate of positive targeted biopsies.   5. To evaluate the rate of positive random biopsies   6. To compare targeted and random biopsies between groups.   7. To compare patient tolerance time consumption and cost of the two methods.   8. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of performing cytological imprints of targeted biopsies. Material and methods: A prospective randomized study including 300 consecutive patients referred to the initial biopsy. The patients are randomized to conventional TRUS biopsies and image fusion guided biopsy. All patients undergo a minimum 12-core re-biopsy procedure. In addition a targeted biopsy will be obtained in case of positive MRI of ultrasound.    ,NCT01455792

Prostate Cancer,A Novel 3D Navigation Technology for Improved TRUS Prostate Biopsy," Prostate biopsy is a procedure in which small samples are removed from a man's prostate gland to be later tested for the presence of cancer. It is typically performed when the scores from a PSA blood test rise to a level that is associated with the possible presence of prostate cancer. The most common method for performing a prostate biopsy procedure is the ultrasound guided transrectal procedure. The information obtained from the standard prostate biopsy is deficient and even misleading. Cancers can be missed on initial and even in repeated biopsy. Moreover the detection of a tumor cannot predict accurately the tumor size and location1. It was proven that the exact location of the obtained cores even in an initial biopsy can influence the cancer detection rate2. An imaging tool that will enable a three-dimensional navigation in the prostate volume and selecting biopsy locations in view of previous core taken will allow building a ""tumor map"" '(i.e. detecting tumor size and location). By mapping the prostate cancer an adequate treatment can be chosen while avoiding over or insufficient treatment. However to be able to produce an accurate mapping of the malignant tissue a complementary optimized pathology method should be also implement in addition to the navigation system it has been shown that a pre-embedding procedure that keeps the specimen orientation unfolding unity and location along the needle notch improves the histological yield and hence the cancer detection rate3. The NaviGo??Workstation (hereafter the NaviGo??Workstation or the NaviGo??System) allows physicians to see the prostate gland together with the biopsy sites in a three dimensional (3D) view modeled from two dimensional (2D) images. The NaviGo??Workstation was designed as an adjunct to standard of care procedures to work with standard rectal ultrasound probes and to be incorporated side by side with the techniques currently employed. No change to the current employed procedures and techniques is required or suggested. In complementary to the Navigo system a system for semi-automatic download of prostate biopsy cores which keeps the orientation unfolding and unity of the sample was developed to increase the pathology utility. The study objective is to evaluate the contribution of the Navigo??system an aiding navigation tool for TRUS prostate biopsy to an increase in the prostate cancer detection ability.    ",NCT01480375

Prostate Cancer,Quantification of Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) in the Detection of Prostate Cancer, With Contrast Enhanced UltraSound (CEUS) cancer induced neovascularisation can be visualised with the potential to improve ultrasound imaging for prostate cancer detection and localisation significantly. The past years numerous studies have been performed with CEUS all basing their results on subjective judgement of the investigator. CEUS image interpretation is difficult and requires a well-trained expert. To overcome these difficulties CEUS quantification techniques can be of use. The techniques used in this protocol have been developed in cooperation with the Technical University in Eindhoven (TU/e) and BRACCO Geneva. The investigators hypothesize improvement of the PCa detection rate with quantification compared with subjective CEUS interpretation and known numbers in literature. Also a comparison between quantification results and tumour differentiation grade (Gleason score) will be made the investigators hypothesize a positive correlation.    ,NCT01481441

Prostate Cancer,Evaluating the Effect of a Decision Aid on Shared Decision Making for Prostate Cancer Screening, Decision-aids are tools to educate patients on a given topic so that they may better participate in shared-decision making in their health care. Given the complexities associated with PSA testing many professional organizations have advocated for shared-decision making for PSA testing. However no consensus exists as to how best educate and involve patients in the shared-decision making process. The goal of this study is to evaluate a pilot program utilizing a simple PSA screening decision-aid presented in two different fashions in a primary care clinic with a large fraction of African-American patients. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of this program to educate patients on the risks and benefits of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing on their subsequent level of comfort with their decision about whether to receive PSA testing and on the comfort level of physicians on their patient's decisions regarding PSA testing and importantly how well these strategies can be implemented into the daily work-flow of a clinic. If successful this program may serve as a model for the broader implementation of such strategies across Minnesota and the country.    ,NCT01484665

Prostate Cancer,GEMOX in Docetaxel-Refractory Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies affecting men all over the World. Metastatic prostate cancer responds to androgen deprivation for a variable period (20-25 months). Prostate cancer that grows despite castrate levels of testosterone and that no longer responds to any form of hormonal manipulation is defined as castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Docetaxel combined with prednisolone has been shown to not only improve QOL and PSA response in CRPC but also extend the overall survival1. However the efficacy of the drug has not been universally effective and nearly all patients have disease progression after docetaxel treatment. After failure of a docetaxel regimen With the exception of cabazitaxel or abiraterone which are not widely and easily availabe in Korea little treatment regimen can be applied to the patients with reasonable response and benefits. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog with activity against a broad spectrum of solid tumors. When gemcitabine is used as first-line therapy for CRPC disease control rate was 33% with median duration of 7.1 months. When it is combined with prednisone and zoledronic acid in pretreated patients with CRPC the PSA response rate was 23% with a disease control rate of 57% in patients with measurable disease. Oxaliplatin is newer platinum agent that has favorable toxicity profile and evidence of activity in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. Droz et al. performed a multicenter phase II study in 54 patients with metastatic CRPC who were randomized to receive oxaliplatin either alone or with 5-FU. More than 50% of the patients had received prior chemotherapy including cisplatin. Despite heavy pretreatment PSA desclines were noted in 11% and 19% of patients in each arm. Gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin combination was widely studied and has been reported to be safe and effective in various cancers. This study is to assess the efficacy and safety of GEMOX in docetaxel-refractory CRPC.    ,NCT01487720

Prostate Cancer,Imaging for Significant Prostate Cancer Risk Evaluation, The incidence of prostate cancer is rising however the number of deaths from prostate cancer is stable. Meaning the investigators are diagnosing many men with prostate cancer that will not impact on their life. The rise in incidence is mainly due to increased use of the blood test Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as a screening test. Currently men suspected of having prostate cancer identified by a raised PSA undergo trans-rectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy (TRUS biopsy). Many men have this test unnecessarily only 1/3 being diagnosed with prostate cancer. TRUS biopsy is problematic as it is random and performed blind-the operator does not know where the cancer is. Thus many low-risk cancers that do not need treating are diagnosed and many high risk cancers are missed or incorrectly classified. So men with a negative biopsy or those with low risk disease are usually advised to undergo another TRUS biopsy. An imaging test is needed that could help men and their doctors decide whether the biopsy is a true reflection of what is inside his prostate. The investigators will test the role of two imaging tests. The first multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) uses magnetic signals from the body to form images. The second Prostate HistoScanning??(PHS) uses sound-waves. The investigators will compare the results of these tests with a detailed biopsy map-transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy (which is currently the best way to find out what is in the prostate but requires multiple biopsies to be taken under general anaesthetic. Eligible men will have undergone one or more TRUS biopsies and who have been advised to have further tests on as part of standard of care. They will be recruited from UCLH referral letters and clinics. The investigators aim is to see if either of these tests can confidently rule out the presence of clinically important disease.    ,NCT01492270
Prostate Cancer,Effectiveness of Localized Prostate Cancer Treatments, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the three most established primary treatments for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (radical prostatectomy external-beam radiotherapy and prostate brachytherapy) at short mid and long-term follow-up.

Prostate Cancer,Evaluation of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-Based PET Imaging of Primary Prostate Cancer, The objective of this study is to evaluate a radiolabeled urea-based small molecule inhibitor of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) [18F]DCFBC (DCFBC) as a PET imaging biomarker of prostate cancer detection and aggressiveness at initial diagnosis. PSMA is a well characterized histological marker of prostate cancer tumor aggressiveness but a quantitative non-invasive method for PSMA detection and monitoring is not currently available. Development of such an imaging biomarker would be useful to differentiate indolent from aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes and allow for selection of appropriate risk adaptive therapies. The investigators preliminary first-in-human studies demonstrate high specific DCFBC uptake in metastatic prostate cancer and feasibility for prostate cancer imaging. The investigators propose to study patients initially diagnosed with biopsy-positive prostate cancer to determine if DCFBC uptake and location by PET imaging will be positively correlated with prostate cancer by prostatectomy tissue step-section analysis. DCFBC uptake at sites of suspected metastatic disease will be compared to conventional imaging modalities (CT bone scan) and biopsy results when available. In addition DCFBC-PET uptake quantification will be compared with expression levels of PSMA and other prostate cancer relevant markers (PSA Ki-67 TMPRSS2-ERG) by prostate tissue immunohistochemistry analysis and compared with clinical prognostic markers (PSA Gleason score clinical stage Partin tables derived prediction of pathologic stage).    ,NCT01496157

Prostate Cancer,Cabazitaxel With or Without Carboplatin in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With Docetaxel-Based Therapy, This clinical research study is made up of 2 groups and 2 phases. The goal of Phase 1 of this study is to learn the highest tolerated dose of the combination of cabazitaxel carboplatin and prednisone that can be given to patients with metastatic CRPC. The goal of Phase 2 of this study is to learn if adding cabazitaxel to the combination of carboplatin and prednisone affects how the disease is controlled in patients with metastatic CRPC. In both of these phases the drug combinations will be compared to cabazitaxel alone. The safety of the drug combinations will be studied in both phases and groups. Cabazitaxel and carboplatin are both designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell division. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is similar to a natural hormone made by your body. It is often given in combination with other chemotherapy to treat cancer.    ,NCT01505868

Prostate Cancer,Study of Acai Juice in Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic Prostate Cancer Patients With Rising PSA, Men who have Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) recurrence with low PSA levels and long doubling times do not require immediate treatment with androgen deprivation therapy and may be safely observed. In these situations where current treatment options may cause more unnecessary side effects than anticipated benefit it is reasonable to use a low-risk natural product such as Acai Juice Product with antioxidant properties to evaluate whether there are any anti-cancer effects.    ,NCT01521949
Prostate Cancer,MR-guided Focused Ultrasound Treatment of Prostate Cancer: Focal Therapy for Locally Non-Advanced Disease, Since prostate specific antigen (PSA) was introduced as a clinical screening tool for prostate cancer more men are diagnosed with small foci of cancers instead of the advanced disease. The present choice of treatment for men with localized prostate cancer lies between active surveillance and radical therapy. Thus the option of treating only the cancer within the prostate gland and sparing the non-cancerous tissue is quite appealing yet very controversial. At present there are no consistent scientific data on focal therapy and its major effectiveness. Focal therapy for prostate cancer is defined as therapy that selectively ablates known disease while preserving existing functions with the overall aim of minimizing lifetime morbidity without compromising life expectancy. The aim of the investigators study is to test if Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound ablation can determine non-invasive necrosis of focal locally non-advanced prostate cancer. The study i designed as Phase 1 treatment & resection protocol. With this project the investigators further aim to evaluate the safety and identify side effects of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound in treating focal prostate cancer. This design will also expand knowledge of the effect of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound onto peri-prostatic environment and to determine if surgery can safely be adopted after this non-invasive treatment.    ,NCT01522118
Prostate Cancer,Study of Cabozantinib (XL184) Versus Mitoxantrone Plus Prednisone in Men With Previously Treated Symptomatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer, Bone metastases and associated pain are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Most approved therapies have shown some ability to reduce soft tissue lesions but none meaningfully impacts bone metastases (as demonstrated by lack of resolution of lesions on bone scan with these agents) or the pain associated with these metastases. This study will evaluate the effect of cabozantinib versus mitoxantrone plus prednisone on pain response and bone scan response in men with CRPC.    ,NCT01522443
Prostate Cancer,Response of Patients on Surveillance for Prostate Cancer to Dutasteride, Hypothesis: That in men on surveillance for favorable risk prostate cancer treated with dutasteride prostate specific antigen (PSA) kinetics is of value in identifying those men who harbor occult high grade prostate cancer. The study will determine the prevalence of a secondary rise in PSA > 0.5 ng/ml and the PSA doubling time in subjects on surveillance being treated with dutasteride.    ,NCT01525914
Prostate Cancer,For Cause Prostate Biopsy in REDUCE Population Trial," The REDUCE trial was conducted to determine whether dutasteride reduces the risk of incident prostate cancer as detected on biopsy among men who are at increased risk for the disease. Dutasteride was compared with placebo for 4 years period. Results showed a relative risk reduction of 22.8 % (95% CI: 15.2 to 29.8)in prostate cancer. For REDUCE biopsies were defined as ""protocol biopsy"" if performed at certain timeframes and ""for cause"" if outside these predetermined timeframes. The investigators propose a post hoc analysis that would allow them to include biopsies that really justified a clinical indication but were excluded from ""for cause"" analysis based on occurring at either the 2 or 4 year timeframes. Thus the investigators propose analysis of both REDUCE groups by every yearly timeframe as: Group 1--dutasteride group biopsied ""for cause"" using several definitions: biopsy of patients who received dutasteride whose PSA rose from nadir as defined in your own protocolwho had a PSA rise>0.2 ng/ml or who had a new abnormal DRE or had a free PSA<12% . The investigators define these as such because this would reasonably instigate biopsy if the clinician had a patient with this scenario in the non-study setting. Group 2--placebo group biopsied ""for cause"" using several definitions regardless of timeframe but reported at each year of the study and aggregate with the aggregate number being the primary outcome. Thus the investigators would request results of biopsy of patients who received placebo To establish differences in biopsy positive rates the groups as per each definition listed to determine if dutasteride decreased the likelihood of ""for cause"" biopsy compared to ""not for cause"" biopsy and if there is a difference in cancer detection risk rate depending on cause vs. no cause in that group compared to placebo.

Prostate Cancer,Androgen Deprivation Therapy Prior to Prostatectomy for Patients With Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer, Degarelix is an approved drug that is used to treat prostate cancer by lowering testosterone levels in the body. Degarelix is commonly given with radiation for prostate cancer but less frequently with surgery since there has been no proven benefit with this approach. The investigators do not expect the patient to benefit directly from treatment with degarelix since their prostate will be removed shortly after the drug is given. Instead the investigators hope to learn about how degarelix and other treatment that lowers your testosterone effects prostate cancer cells and use this information to develop better treatments in the future.    ,NCT01542021
Prostate Cancer,Clinical and Molecular Correlates of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) With 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 in Metastatic Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this study is to define the safety and accuracy of 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 PET scans. By improving our ability to find cancer cells the investigators hope to be able to improve treatment for patients in the future. The study doctors want to determine whether a new kind of scan called a 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 PET scan can specifically see prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body especially the bones. The study doctors will also look at how the 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 reacts with the body and how long it stays in the body. The investigators will also ask the patient to have a biopsy performed. The study doctors will compare the findings the investigators see on the scans with findings on the optional tissue biopsy. Finally the investigators will compare the pictures from a 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 PET scan with those of a standard PET scan (called FDG PET) and standard CT scans or magnetic resonance (MRI) scans or bone scans depending on which standard scans the doctor has ordered. PET scanning uses a small amount of radiation attached to a molecule that is taken up by the cancer. In this trial the patient will undergo two types of PET scans. One uses FDG. FDG is a standard tracer for PET scans. The patient will also undergo another type of PET scan that is experimental. This experimental PET uses a radioactive protein called J591. The radiation source is a type of metal called zirconium-89 (89Zr). The whole tracer J591 plus the 89Zr is abbreviated as 89Zr-DFO-huJ591. This tracer is what is being studied. The tracer used in a scan should find where the cancer is in the body.    ,NCT01543659
Prostate Cancer,The Use of Transperineal Ultrasound for Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning and Image Guidance in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer, This study is being done to find out if transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) can help define the prostate gland for radiation treatment planning and improve upon current methods of image guidance for the treatment of prostate cancer. For the patient TPUS involves the placement of an ultrasound probe on the perineum the skin between the scrotum and anus while they are lying on their back in the position they will receive their treatment. Image-guidance is required for the treatment of prostate cancer because the prostate shifts position depending on how full the bladder and rectum are. Image-guided radiation therapy has been done at Fletcher Allen Health Care for approximately three years. Most commonly transabdominal ultrasound images are obtained every day and compared to an ultrasound that was done on the day of treatment planning. Adjustments in radiation field position can be done on a daily basis by comparing these images. Transperineal ultrasound has never been used for image-guidance. The investigators completed an earlier study and have developed a TPUS device and process that allow us to get clear ultrasound pictures of the prostate gland. The TPUS has three potential advantages over the transabdominal method the investigators currently use:   1. Transabdominal ultrasound can be a challenge for some men. A full bladder helps us get clearer images however it is difficult for some men with prostate cancer to comfortably keep a full bladder. It is also particularly difficult to get good images in larger men who have long distances from the skin surface to the prostate gland. TPUS is not dependent on a man having a full bladder and should be less dependent on the size of the man.   2. TPUS images and the planning CT images can be acquired simultaneously. This is not possible with the abdominal probe because it gets in the way of the CT machine. Simultaneous imaging eliminates the possibility of the prostate gland shifting positions during the time between imaging studies.   3. TPUS can be in place and acquire images during patient treatment (the abdominal probe gets in the way of the treatment machine) and may in the future allow us to watch the prostate gland during treatment. If the investigators discover that they can accurately view the prostate gland in real time TPUS may ultimately allow us to treat even smaller radiation fields and possibly decrease the risk of radiation complications. Patients in this study will be treated for their prostate cancer with the standard image guidance techniques used at Fletcher Allen Health Care: transabdominal ultrasound and/or X-ray imaging of gold marker seeds that have been placed the prostate gland. In addition to standard care all men in this study will have TPUS and CT scans done a total of four times over 12 weeks to compare these methods of prostate localization over the course of radiation treatments. Some men may choose to take part in an additional study that will also include MRI of the pelvis to compare with the TPUS and CT. Because the prostate gland can be more clearly defined on MRI some institutions (not Fletcher Allen) routinely have patients with prostate cancer get MRI scans for treatment planning. This has not been proven to improve the care of men with prostate cancer and it is possible that TPUS will provide similarly clear images. The potential advantages to TPUS imaging for prostate localization over MRI include the fact that it is done at the same time as the CT for treatment planning (so eliminates the possibility of movement of the prostate gland from the time of the MRI to the time of the CT) and can be done at a much lower cost.    ,NCT01545154

Prostate Cancer,Hormone Therapy Radiation Therapy and Steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase TAK-700 in Treating Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs such as steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase TAK-700 when used with other hormone therapy may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. This may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer when combined with hormone therapy. Studying quality-of-life in patients having cancer treatment may help identify the intermediate- and long-term effects of treatment on patients with prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the use of hormone therapy including TAK-700 together with radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.    ,NCT01546987

Prostate Cancer,Non-systemic Treatment for Patients With Low-volume Metastatic Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer patients diagnosed with a biochemical recurrence and limited metastases are conventionally treated with androgen deprivation therapy. However in patients with limited metastatic load the time to progression might be. Subsequently active surveillance of these patients until progression might defer the start of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for several months to years. As an alternative salvage treatment of the limited number of metastases with either surgery or radiotherapy might postpone the start of ADT even longer. The current trial hypothesizes that ADT might be deferred longer following salvage treatment as compared to active surveillance.    ,NCT01558427

Prostate Cancer,XL-184+Abiraterone in Post-Chemo CRPC," This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of an investigational drug. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) may not have approved this drug for use in participants including people with your type of cancer. In this research study we are testing the safety of XL184 at different dose levels. XL184 is a new study drug which is taken by mouth. Laboratory studies have shown that XL184 may prevent tumor growth by stopping the formation of blood vessels inside the tumor and also shrink tumors. This drug has been used in early-stage studies and is also currently being studied in other trials. Information from those other research studies suggests that XL184 may help to slow or stop tumor growth including prostate cancer. We will also be taking blood and urine tests to look at how your body processes the drug.    ",NCT01574937
Prostate Cancer,Oncological and Functional Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: Comparing Open With Robot-assisted Surgery, For primary surgical treatment of prostate cancer the investigators compare the classic open surgery (radical retropubic prostatectomy RRP) versus robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALP). Oncological results are obtained at standard follow-up consultations through Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) measurement to detect biochemical recurrence. Functional results (continence potency quality of life) are obtained through standardised questionnaires. Currently the investigators perform all of their prostatectomies in a robot-assisted manner. For results of the open surgery the investigators send questionnaires to patients who had the operation in the past.    ,NCT01578356

Prostate Cancer,Focal Salvage HDR Brachytherapy for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer, Radiation therapy is considered a standard treatment option for the management of localized prostate cancer. Among the 20-30% who recur a proportion of them will present with an isolated local recurrence meaning no distant metastases. If left untreated it may serve as a source for subsequent metastases. Salvage options available for isolated local recurrence include; temporary or permanent implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate complete removal of the prostate gland use of low temperatures to treat the disease and high frequency ultrasound to treat the disease. There are risks of complications associated with all these treatments and there is presently no consensus as to which treatment is the best. Therefore the aim of this pilot study is to look at the feasibility and toxicities of focal treatment of the prostate using temporary implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate which the investigators hope will be less since the entire prostate is not treated.    ,NCT01583920
Prostate Cancer,Prostate Advances in Comparative Evidence, This study is an international multicentre randomised study of organ confined low and intermediate risk prostate cancer and is composed of two parallel randomisation schemes based on applicability of surgery as a treatment for the patient.

Prostate Cancer,External Immobilization Compared to Limited Immobilization Using a Novel Real-time Localization System of the Prostate, This prospective study at MAMC evaluates the utility of a rigid pelvic external immobilization compared to limited immobilization using a novel real-time localization system of the prostate. The sample population will include patients referred to the radiation oncology services of both facilities for definitive treatment of prostate cancer. The study will enroll 20 subjects from MAMC and evaluate data on 860 radiation therapy fractions. Subjects will have Beacon® Transponders implanted into the prostate to more precisely localize the position of the organ during radiation therapy. They will be randomized to rigid pelvic immobilization using a Vac-Lok® system or limited immobilization with a band around the patient's feet. They will then undergo radiation therapy planning with standard planning target margins. The Calypso® 4D Localization System will monitor in real time the position of the prostate target and adjust radiation treatments as required to ensure accurate treatment of the prostate gland. The time of the number and extent of adjustments will be recorded for analysis. Hypothesis: 1. When treating only the prostate treatment with rigid pelvic immobilization is not necessary when using real-time state-of-the-art motion tracking of the prostate.    ,NCT01588938

Prostate Cancer,Metabolic Effects of Treatment in Intermediate and High-Risk Prostate Cancer, This study will work towards understanding the changes in your body (metabolism) that develop with treatment in prostate cancer. Hormonal therapies such as ADT often result in detrimental changes in body composition including lean tissue loss and fat gains compared to those patients receiving radiation therapy. These changes in body composition are linked to risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in survivorship. The investigators will be evaluating 50 patients to primarily examine the changes in metabolism nutrition physical function and body composition at the end of treatment 6 weeks and 6 months following the end of treatment. Patients will continue to be followed every 6 months for up to 5 years following the end of treatment.

Prostate Cancer,11C Acetate Imaging Post Prostatectomy," This research is being conducted to test an imaging technique that may be able to detect small amounts of prostate cancer that can not be detected by standard imaging. Many patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer undergo surgery to remove the prostate. After this surgery some patients have a PSA blood test that reveals a low but detectable level of PSA. This PSA may be produced by cancer cells in one of two locations: (1) near the area where the prostate used to be or (2) elsewhere in the body. If the cancer is only in the area where the prostate used to be it can be successfully treated with radiation to that area. If the cancer is elsewhere radiation is not helpful. Currently there is no available scan that can detect cancer when the PSA is still so low. The test used in this study is called [11C] acetate PET screening. [11C] acetate is a radioactive tracer that is given by vein to patients before PET scanning. The PET scanner then detects radioactivity from the tracer that is attached to cells within your body and uses this information to create images (pictures) on a computer screen. [11C] acetate PET scanning has been shown in early studies to detect smaller amounts of prostate cancer that can be detected by standard imaging tests such as CT scan and bone scan. If it is successful at detecting very small amounts of prostate cancer [11C] acetate PET scanning will help doctors identify patients who will benefit from radiation therapy after their prostate has been surgically removed. It will also help them identify patients who have small amounts of prostate cancer in other parts of the body and will not benefit from radiation to the prostate area. This type of PET scan is investigational. ""Investigational"" means that the scan is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not approved this type of PET scan for your type of cancer. The information collected by this scan will determine whether this type of scanning is helpful but it will not be used to make decisions about your medical care.    ",NCT01602783
Prostate Cancer,External Beam Radiation With or Without Chemotherapy to Treat High Risk Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this study is to compare the effects on prostate cancer using radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy.    ,NCT01603420
Prostate Cancer,High Dose Rate Prostate Brachytherapy: Dose Escalation to Dominant Intra-prostatic Nodule, This study will investigate the feasibility of using technology of ultrasound guided HDR brachytherapy to focally increase dose to regions within the prostate that are heavily infiltrated with cancer. Such regions referred to as dominant intraprostatic lesions (DIL) can be visualized using diffusion contrast enhanced MRI employing an endo-rectal coil. The magnetic resonance (MR) images can be fused with the planning transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prior to the brachytherapy procedure to design a dose distribution that will encompass the malignant volume with higher than the prescription dose. By its nature brachytherapy has subvolumes that receive (for example)125% of the prescription dose or 150% of the prescription dose. With TRUS-guided and TRUS-planned HDR these areas can be manipulated to coincide with the DIL. The limit of dose escalation has been reached at whole prostate external beam doses of 81-86 Gy and still failure rates for intermediate and high risk disease are unacceptable. There is much interest in focal dose escalation and TRUS-guided HDR brachytherapy is perfectly suited to achieving this.    ,NCT01605097

Prostate Cancer,MRI for Assessing Prostate Cancer Response, Prostate cancer is one of most common cancers in America affecting 1 in 6 men. External beam radiation therapy is one of the common methods to treat prostate cancer. Although radiotherapy is effective side effects to the adjacent normal organs limit the therapeutic ratio. Those side effects are usually associated with the radiation damage of the normal tissue surrounding prostate e.g. bladder urethra and rectum etc. Both effectiveness and the side effects of radiation treatment are often accessed after whole course of radiotherapy which makes the early intervention difficult. The current research project is a feasibility study of utilizing advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to access radiotherapy treatment response of prostate cancer during and right after radiotherapy. Many advanced MRI techniques e.g. spectroscopy (MRS) diffusion-weighted (DWI) dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) perfusion weighted images have been used in radiology departments for diagnostic purpose. This research project is to study the feasibility of using advanced MRI sequences to monitor tissue response during and after radiotherapy. The tissue changes revealed from MRI can provide physicians early information on possible tumor recurrence and normal tissue toxicity therefore the early intervention may be possible to spare normal tissue and cure the patient. The project is designed to combine several different advanced MRI imaging techniques systematically to study tissue changes during radiotherapy which has not been seen elsewhere to date. Another important goal of this research project is to study the feasibility of associating functional MRI with radiation treatment dose distribution. Tissue response during radiation treatment depends on dose. The functional MRI can provide more information than simple anatomic information. Mapping the functional MRI spatially and associating them with 3D dose distribution in radiation treatment planning system is one important step to quantitative assess the relationship between radiation treatment and tissue changes due to the radiation.    ,NCT01607008

Prostate Cancer,Proton Therapy vs. IMRT for Low or Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer, We are studying whether men being treated for prostate cancer have the same amount of side effects from either one of two different external radiation treatments: IMRT or PBT. With IMRT a number of x-ray beams are used to shape the radiation to the prostate. PBT is another type of external radiation treatment for prostate cancer that is used in a few centers in the United States. Protons are tiny particles with positive charge that can be controlled to travel a certain distance and stop. PBT is precise like IMRT but it uses proton beams instead of x-ray beams. IMRT and PBT aim to deliver most of the radiation to the prostate cancer while sparing surrounding tissues. Both IMRT and PBT have been used in the treatment of prostate cancer and are thought to be equally effective at curing prostate cancer. However both treatments have also been shown to cause the potential side effects of radiation including bowel urinary and erectile problems. It is possible that side effect rates with PBT will be lower the same or even higher than with IMRT but this has not been studied well to date. Though both of these radiation therapies have been used in the past to treat prostate cancer there has never been a study that compares the effects of these two therapies to see which one has less side effects. In this research study we are comparing IMRT to PBT to determine which therapy best minimizes the side effects of treatment.    ,NCT01617161

Prostate Cancer,Castration Compared to Castration Plus Metformin as First Line Treatment for Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in men. Patients with recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer are treated with androgen-deprivation therapy often termed castration therapy. While the short and medium term benefits of castration are clear in relation to therapeutic efficacy in patients with prostate cancer it is now appreciated that the resulting hypogonadism associated with castration is responsible for adverse consequences or metabolic syndrome that include increase in body mass index (BMI) and fat mass hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance hyperlipidemia reduced lean body mass (LBM) and muscle strength osteoporosis sexual dysfunction poor quality of life and higher cardiovascular mortality. Lower testosterone levels in men independently predict the development of metabolic syndrome. Low testosterone levels in men are associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. Metformin is commonly prescribed for the treatment of type II diabetes because it lowers both glucose and insulin levels. Studies show preliminary evidence that metformin might have both antineoplastic and chemopreventative activity. Castration therapy decreases insulin sensitivity adversely alters lipid profiles and results in weight gain and it may be associated with a greater incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Little is known about the optimal strategy to mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of castration in men with prostate cancer. The rationale for using metformin in castrated men with advanced prostate cancer stems from the observation that castration therapy is associated with the metabolic syndrome hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Furthermore reports that hyperinsulinemia stimulates insulin receptor expression on prostate cancer leading to tumor growth and development of castrate resistant prostate cancer suggest metformin through its activation of the AMPK-LKBI pathway reduces liver gluconeogenesis secondarily decreasing insulin levels may circumvent tumor growth and resistance to castration therapy. More importantly evidence that metformin inhibits the mTOR pathway implicates an added therapeutic benefit as an anti-cancer agent.    ,NCT01620593

Prostate Cancer,Cabazitaxel and Radiation For Patients With Pathologically Determined Stage 3 Prostate Cancer and/or Patients With PSA Elevation (>0.1- < 2.0 ng/mL), There is a high relapse rate for patients who have undergone prostatectomy and have pathologic extracapsular prostate extension positive surgical margins or seminal vesicle involvement (pathologic stage 3 disease). While adjuvant radiation improves progression-free and overall survival approximately half of these patients will develop recurrence. Similarly radiation therapy has become the standard salvage therapy for patients with rising PSA >0.1 - < 2.0 ng/mL. In common solid tumors such as NSCLC head and neck cancer and upper gastrointestinal cancers the addition of chemotherapy to radiation improves survival. It is hypothesized that the addition of radiosensitizing chemotherapy to standard adjuvant radiation will improve survival in patients with stage 3 prostate cancer after prostatectomy and patients with rising PSA < 2.0 ng.mL without detectable disease. Taxanes are powerful radiation enhancers since they synchronize tumor cells in G2/M the most radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle.1718 Cabazitaxel is the most active taxane in the treatment of prostate cancer. Therefore we propose a phase I study establishing the optimal dose of cabazitaxel with adjuvant radiation for stage 3 prostate cancer after prostatectomy (PSA undetectable - < 2.0 ng/mL). and for patients with persistent or rising PSA post prostatectomy (PSA >0.1 - < 2.0 ng/mL).    ,NCT01650285
Prostate Cancer,3-Tesla MRI in Finding Tumors in Patients With Known or Suspected Prostate Cancer, In standard clinical care the prostate is imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is a procedure to take pictures of body structures by using a strong magnetic field and radio waves. The strength of the magnet used is expressed in the unit Tesla (T); a higher Tesla number means the magnet has stronger pull. Standard magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate uses a magnet 1.5 Tesla strong as well as a specialized endorectal coil (antenna) inserted into the body due to the limitations using an external body coil at this magnet strength. MRI using a 3 Tesla magnet has a theoretical advantage over imaging at 1.5 Tesla of creating a signal twice as strong that can be received by the antennas resulting in better pictures. The goal of this study is to make the MRI procedure more comfortable for patients by using an external coil instead of an endorectal coil. With this study researchers also want to help patients' health care teams the surgeons in particular. Researchers will assess the impact of prostate MRI without an endorectal coil done at 3 Tesla and with an external body coil on helping doctors decide which approaches to disease therapy might be best for patients as well as correlate patients' study images with all other clinical imaging    ,NCT01653093

Prostate Cancer,High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer, The first technology is called high dose rate brachytherapy. Brachytherapy is sometimes called internal radiation therapy. High dose rate brachytherapy is a procedure that involves temporarily placing radioactive material inside the patient's body for about 10-20 minutes. Then the remainder of the radiation treatment will be given over a 3 week period using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). SBRT is a novel treatment modality that involves the delivery of very high individual doses of radiation to tumors with high precision. This allows the doctor to deliver the same amount of radiation in a much shorter time. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of brachytherapy when combined with hypofractionated SBRT.    ,NCT01655836

Prostate Cancer,FACBC Outcomes for Post Prostatectomy, Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor with approximately 200000 new cases diagnosed per year. Several different local therapies are available for treatment including surgery and radiotherapy Significant advances have been made in the technical aspects of surgery and of radiotherapy which have improved both the cancer control outcomes as well as the morbidity of treatment. Despite these significant advances approximately 30% of patients treated with definitive local therapy experience recurrent disease. Recurrent disease after prostatectomy usually manifests with rising PSA (blood test for prostate cancer). The PSA level is often of limited use in differentiating local recurrence (ie. recurrence in the prostate bed) from recurrence outside of the prostate bed ( extra-prostatic recurrence). One PET radiotracer which has shown promise in the staging and restaging of patients with prostate carcinoma is anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (anti-3-[18F]FACBC) which is a synthetic amino acid analog. FACBC demonstrated higher accuracy compared with 111Indium-capromab-pendetide in the restaging of patients with suspected recurrent prostate carcinoma. The major goal in this proposed investigation is to use advanced molecular imaging to better guide post-prostatectomy decision making in terms of guiding the decision to deliver radiotherapy and in terms of the exact areas treated with radiotherapy. Investigators will perform a study with 162 patients in whom there is a strong suspicion of prostate cancer that has returned to the body after having a prostatectomy. Half of these patients will have radiotherapy decision-making and delivery per the usual routine and half of these patients will have the radiotherapy decision and volumes guided by the FACBC test. The major goal of the investigation is to see whether the FACBC improves the selection and the cancer control rates of post-surgery patients with a rising PSA who undergo radiotherapy.    ,NCT01666808

Prostate Cancer,Predictive Value of Prostate-specific Antigen Isoform p2psa and Its Derivates in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer, In Europe prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common solid neoplasm with an incidence rate of 214 cases per 1000 men outnumbering lung and colorectal cancer. Early detection tests have been developed in order to identify PCa while it is still confined to the prostate gland. The two most commonly used tests are digital rectal examination and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level: however most of cases is detected in the so called T1c stage i.e. for PSA increasing only. As marker PSA is organ-specific but not cancer-specific and its levels may change as result of physical activity sexual activity in the presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) acute and chronic prostatitis as well as in the presence of PCa. A total serum PSA of 4.0 ng/ml has traditionally been used as threshold for considering prostate biopsy and large programs for the early detection of prostate cancer have shown that almost 70% of cancer cases can be detected using a PSA cutoff of 4.0 ng/ml. However using a PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/ml 20% to 25% of prostate cancer cases are not detected (false-negative) and the false-positive rate is 65%. To improve the usefulness of PSA for identifying patients who require biopsy the PSA threshold has been lowered at 2 ng/ml; moreover the levels of free and bound PSA have been assessed together with PSA density (the rate of PSA over the prostate volume) and PSA velocity (the rate of PSA increase) which seem to have some validity for detecting prostate cancer. Recent studies have shown that other new biomarkers could be used in the diagnosis of early prostate cancer as they showed a higher sensitivity and specificity. In the last two years several investigators showed that PSA isoform [??] proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives namely percentage of p2PSA to free PSA (%p2PSA) and the Prostate Health Index [PHI; (p2PSA / free PSA) × ?tPSA)] improve the accuracy of total PSA (tPSA) and percentage of free PSA (%fPSA) in predicting the presence of PCa at prostate biopsy and they are also related to PCa aggressiveness at biopsy. The aim of this study is to confirm the diagnostic and prognostic predictive value of prostate-specific antigen isoform p2psa and its derivates %p2psa and prostate health index in the detection of prostate cancer in patients with a PSA 2-10 ng/ml and/or suspicious DRE.    ,NCT01672411

Prostate Cancer,A Study of Prostate and pelvIs Versus prOsTate Alone Treatment for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK with 35000 cases diagnosed annually. 35% of these are locally advanced disease. These patients have a high chance of pelvic lymph node involvement and have relatively poor prostate cancer survival rates of 22.5% at 10 years. One of the standard treatments for these patients is radiotherapy to the prostate. PIVOTAL is a multi-centre phase II non-comparative randomised feasibility trial in which patients with a high chance of pelvic lymph node involvement are randomised between prostate radiotherapy alone and prostate + pelvic radiotherapy. Both groups will receive radiotherapy called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). This is a relatively new method of shaping radiotherapy treatment beams which allows the tumour to be treated more precisely whilst avoiding more of the surrounding normal healthy tissues (particularly the rectum bladder and bowel). Using IMRT it is possible to deliver higher doses of radiotherapy to the pelvis than with previous radiotherapy methods - this has been tested in a single hospital single group setting and levels of side effects (toxicity) were acceptable. PIVOTAL aims to find out whether toxicity levels at 18 weeks from the start of radiotherapy remain acceptable when treatment is given in multiple cancer centres across the UK. It is randomised to ensure unbiased collection of acute toxicity data and to provide information on patients' willingness to participate in a randomised study. Should the phase II study be successful the investigators would develop a phase III trial to compare treatment effectiveness (disease control). Patients who enter PIVOTAL will be followed up for two years from the start of radiotherapy and data relating to toxicity will be collected. They will also be asked to complete patient related symptoms questionnaires. Data related to disease recurrence will then be collected annually from patients' standard hospital visits.    ,NCT01685190

Prostate Cancer,Red Yeast Rice in Subjects With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Active Surveillance, Agents that inhibit cholesterol synthesis are being investigated in cancers dependent upon cholesterogenesis. Red yeast rice (RYR) is a reddish-purple fermented rice containing statins which are known to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Laboratory studies have also shown that RYR has direct effects on androgen dependent and androgen independent prostate cancer cells inhibiting their growth. It is thought that RYR may have clinical benefit in those subjects with localized prostate cancer who have chosen to be managed by active surveillance.    ,NCT01687049

Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone is a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone has not been used together with ipilimumab before. This study will test how they work together. Each patient will receive abiraterone acetate prednisone and ipilimumab.    ,NCT01688492
Prostate Cancer,Mild Cognitive Impairment in Men Following Androgen Deprivation, MCI with ageing is thought in part to be related to reduced serum sex hormones which is well-recognised especially in females but poorly understood. International studies assessing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to prevent/reduce MCI are ongoing. MCI leads to morbidity reduced quality of life and substantial healthcare costs. The commonest therapeutically induced reduction in sex hormone level in men is treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). PCa is androgen dependent and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) suppressing testosterone to castrate levels is key therapy for advanced disease. About one million men worldwide have received ADT for PCa mostly using luteinising hormone releasing-hormone agonists (LHRHa) although oral oestrogens were used in the past; eventually perhaps 4% of Caucasians may be castrated. MCI as a side-effect of castration in men remains poorly researched. This pilot study will quantify the extent of MCI in men receiving ADT with LHRHa and oestrogen to inform the design of a larger study to understand mechanisms predict affected patients and determine ways of reducing MCI. Researching relationships of sex hormones and MCI should improve understanding and interventions for slowing/preventing MCI in PCa survivors. HRT in women slows MCI. Alternatives for ADT include parenteral oestrogen. The PATCH clinical trial comparing transdermal oestrogen with LHRHa offers an opportunity to assess oestrogen as preventative for male MCI. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and neuropsychological tests will be used to test this hypothesis.    ,NCT01691976

Prostate Cancer,GTN Therapy on Biomarkers of Immune Escape in Men With Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Primary Therapy, Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in Canada. Over 30% of men over the age of fifty have histological evidence of prostate cancer on biopsy. Despite the stage migration afforded by early detection with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing and an apparent trend toward improved survival over the past several years prostate cancer remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Biochemical failure after primary therapy (surgery or radiation) remains a significant health care burden and strategies to delay clinical prostate cancer progression and prolong the interval from treatment failure to systemic therapy would be of significant clinical benefit for those men suffering from a finding of PSA recurrence. PSA is widely accepted as the most useful prognostic marker of prostate cancer progression particularly after primary therapy with radical surgery or radiation. 5 Despite improved cancer control rates with definitive management of early stage prostate cancer a PSA recurrence is unfortunately a common occurrence (25-50%) in most large case series. Microenvironmental factors have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the selection of neoplastic cell subpopulations expressing more malignant phenotypes and contributing to the progression of localized and metastatic disease. Very low levels of O2 (< 10 mmHg) has been well described in many solid tumours (including prostate cancer) and the extent of hypoxia has been demonstrated to represent an independent marker of a poor prognosis for patients with various types of cancers. Tumour hypoxia contributes to numerous adaptive phenotypes including increased invasion and metastasis as well as evasion of immune cell surveillance increased resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Although cellular adaptive responses to hypoxia are likely mediated by various mechanisms our previous preclinical studies suggest that decreased nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signalling plays a significant role in this progression of a malignant phenotype.    ,NCT01704274

Prostate Cancer,Acute Effects of Exercise on the Cortical Silent Period in Prostate Cancer Patients, In Canadian men prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent form of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Unfortunately PCa survivors are often burdened with feelings of anxiety and depression associated with the disease and associated treatments. Short-term exercise interventions (8-24 weeks) have improved psychosocial well-being in this population but the impact of single bouts of exercise and related psychological or neurological changes have never been studied. The primary objective of the proposed study is to examine the effect of an acute bout of exercise on neurophysiological and psychological indicators of well-being in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 36 men with PCa. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention (60 min exercise) or control (60 min of television) and will undergo a brief neurological test (cortical silent period) and psychological questionnaires before and after their group assignment.    ,NCT01715064

Prostate Cancer,A Feasibility Study of an Online Intervention for Sexual Rehabilitation in Prostate Cancer, Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer for men. When treated early enough it is typically curable. However common treatments such as radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy often result in significant negative outcomes with regard to sexual psychological and social function. Both men and partners have identified the need for more information and support to address sexual health concerns after treatment. However very few sexual rehabilitation interventions have been developed and rigorously assessed. Purpose: The investigators propose to develop and pilot test a new program to meet the sexual health needs of men with PCa and their partners using an online professionally facilitated education/support program. The goals of the program are to improve sexual function intimacy and mood for men and their partners after treatment for localized PCa. The program will be offered through Cancer Chat Canada an existing and well-tested Canadian platform for professionally facilitated support group programs. What Participants Can Expect: A total of 24 men and their female partners (48 individuals) will be recruited and assigned to one of two groups. The first group will participate in the program immediately; the second group will be offered the program after a 5-month delay. The decision about which group will start immediately and which later will be made randomly (by chance). Both groups of men and partners will be asked to complete questionnaires three times and at the end of the program to provide the researchers feedback about how satisfied they were with the program the changes they made things they learned as a result of the program and suggestions for improving the program. Participants must have access to a computer an Internet connection and be willing to attend online chat room meetings each week for 1.5 hours for 6 weeks. Implications: Sexual rehabilitation is a high need for men affected by PCa but is difficult to access. The investigators hope to improve access to sexual health care through this study.    ,NCT01716702

Prostate Cancer,Update and Biodistribution of [F-18]FMDHT pET/CT in Normal Healthy Volunteers and Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer - A First in Human Subject Study With [F-18] FMDHT, Prostate cancer represents a significant health problem in the United States. This year 179000 men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate carcinoma and approximately 25% of them will die of the disease. In addition the incidence and mortality of prostate carcinoma has been increasing steadily in the United States. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are commonly used as a biomarker for the detection of prostate cancer. Nonetheless there is a significant false negative and false positive diagnosis since PSA levels elevate in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis and decrease in patients taking medications and herbal remedies. Twenty percent of biopsy-proven prostate carcinoma have PSA levels within the normal range thus confounding the diagnosis based on the PSA screening test. Current diagnostic methods that include transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and TRUS guided prostate biopsy are logistically difficult and insensitive. These are further complicated by equivocal prostatic biopsy findings such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) or normal PSA with high clinical suspicion. A tracer with high specificity to prostate cancer related structures at a cellular level would enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of prostate cancer and would contribute to the detection localization and quantification of the disease and its metastases. This information will be invaluable in selecting the appropriate treatment regimen. This study will test the utility of [F-18]FMDHT to image prostate cancer and will evaluate if this radiotracer can differentiate primary prostate cancer in the prostate gland from normal prostate gland itself. More specifically we will study the distribution kinetics of [F-18]FMDHT in normal healthy humans and in patients with prostate cancer. As per exploratory IND requirements we performed toxicity assessment of FMDHT through an outside laboratory (ILS Inc.) and the results of that study are attached as Appendix A. Based on our and others data we hypothesize that:   1. [F-18]FMDHT PET/CT will distribute initially in various normal tissues following blood flow pattern and will clear rapidly from tissues with no AR.   2. [F-18]FMDHT PET/CT will detect metastatic disease that expresses AR.   3. [F-18]FMDHT PET/CT uptake will be elevated in AR-expressing prostate cancer lesions compared to surrounding normal prostate. In order to progress [F-18]FMDHT into clinic we are performing a pilot 'first-in-human' biodistribution study in subjects with and without prostate cancer.    ,NCT01724619

Prostate Cancer,Assessment of HIFU-induced Prostate Necrosis With Shear-wave Ultrasound Elastography, Transrectal High-intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally-invasive therapy for prostate cancer that is currently assessed in two indications: as a first-line treatment (either total or focal) for patients who are not eligible for surgery and as a salvage treatment of local recurrences after radiotherapy. It has recently been shown that Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) can accurately assess the position and volume of tissue destruction at the end of prostate HIFU ablation. This can provide live feedback regarding the amount of residual non ablated tissue after HIFU treatment which could allow immediate re-treatment in case of unsatisfactory result. CEUS requires the injection of micro-bubbles of sulphur hexafluoride (Sonovue Bracco Milan Italy) which can at least in theory interfere with HIFU treatment. Therefore it is necessary to wait 20 to 30 minutes before re-treating the patient. Shear-wave ultrasound elastography (SWUE Supersonic Imagine Aix-en-Provence France) can quantify tissue stiffness. Moreover post-HIFU necrosis is known to be stiffer than undestroyed prostate tissue. Therefore SWUE could be an alternative to CEUS and the purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of SWUE in depicting the position and volume of therapeutic necrosis after prostate cancer High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) ablation. The present study is an exploratory monocentric prospective descriptive study. Three groups of 10 patients with prostate cancer will be evaluated: patients referred for first-line prostate HIFU ablation patients referred for first-line HIFU hemi-ablation (focal treatment) and patients referred for salvage HIFU after radiotherapy. SWUE will be obtained the day before HIFU ablation (D-1) immediately after HIFU ablation (D0) and the following day (D+1). CEUS will be performed immediately after HIFU ablation and D0 SWUE. The primary endpoint is the comparison of the thickness of undestroyed parenchyma measured by SWUE and CEUS. The secondary endpoints are:   -  The evolution of shear elasticity within the treated area measured by SWUE at D-1 D0 and D+1   -  Adverse events related to SWUE. The study will last 40 months.    ,NCT01729442

A man's risk of developing prostate cancer increases if he has a first-degree relative (father or brother) who was diagnosed with prostate cancer at a young age. This is why we are looking for men who are affected at a young age or who have a family history of prostate cancer since it is more probable that these prostate cancers are due to an inherited genetic cause rather than an environmental cause. We also ask all men who come to the Royal Marsden Hospital to be treated for prostate cancer if they would like to take part in the study so that we can also look to see if we find genetic alterations in older men and those who do not have a family history of prostate cancer.    ,NCT01737242
Prostate Cancer,The ProCaRis Study: Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in General Practice, The preferred method for early detection of prostate cancer (PCa) in older men with family history is the Prostate Specific Antigen test (PSA test) although the method is imprecise. It produces a high number of false-positive results and increases the risk of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. Yet an increasing number of men get the PSA test as part of unsystematic screening. Genetic risk assessment may be a better way to identify men with low risk of PCa. The main study hypothesis is that genetic information about low risk of PCa can reduce the number of patients who get a PSA test as part of unsystematic screening.    ,NCT01739062
Prostate Cancer,BKM120+Abiraterone Acetate for Metastatic CRPC," This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of an investigational drug in this case an investigational drug combined with standard drug therapy. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is still being studied and taht research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not approved the drug for use in patients including people with your type of cancer. BKM120 is a drug that inhibits the ability of tumors to grow and survive which may lead to better outcomes in many types of cancer. Abiraterone acetate is a drug that is approved for the treatment of prostate cancer and works by inhibiting an enzyme found in prostate tumor tissue. While taking abiraterone acetate individuals must also take a glucocorticoid such as prednisone. Most patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer will receive treatment with docetaxel after which treatment with the combination of abiraterone and prednisone has been shown to be effective. Evidence has shown an interaction between the pathways through which BKM120 and abiraterone act on cancer. Therefore it is thought that the treatment of castrate-resistant prostate cancer will be enhanced by combining BKM120 with abiraterone plus prednisone. The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose for the combination of daily oral BKM120 abiraterone acetate and prednisone in patients with castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer who have received prior treatment with docetaxel.

Prostate Cancer,Prevalence of Neglected Side Effects to Radical Prostatectomy, The purpose of this exploratory data collection is to strengthen our knowledge of some of the rarer distresses following surgical removal of the prostate. In general these are:   -  Side effects related to sexuality including:   -  Altered perception of orgasm   -  Orgasm associated pain   -  Penile shortening and deformity.   -  Side effects related to urinary incontinence.   -  Urinary tract infection after operation.   -  Influence of distress on sexual quality of life.   -  Influence of distress on the patient´s sex drive. In addition information on a range of demographics and information on the patient´s erectile function will be collected.    ,NCT01742962
Prostate Cancer,A Comparison of Totally Intravenous and Inhalation Anesthesia for Intraocular Pressure During Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy, Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) has gained popularity during the past decade and has widely replaced conventional open prostatectomy in many institutions due to reduced blood loss nerve sparing less postoperative pain and shorter hospital stay. However laparoscopic surgery is performed with intraperitoneal carbon dioxide insufflation which leads to increased intraocular pressure (IOP). In particular robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) usually requires a steep Trendelenburg position and often prolonged insufflation times which is known to effect the increase in IOP during surgery and may result in ophthalmic complications such as postoperative vision loss (POVL). The majority of patients undergoing RALRP is old aged and often present with comorbidities. Advanced age underlying diabetes mellitus (DM) or hypertension renders the patient vulnerable to damage due to increased IOP. Moreover the possibility of the patient having undiagnosed glaucoma is also increased and therefore methods to prevent such complications are needed. As of now intravenous hypnotic agents inhalation anesthetics and opioids have been reported to decrease IOP by relaxing extraocular muscle tone and increasing aqueous humour outflow to some extent. Among these agents propofol has been reported to be more effective than other inhalational anesthetics in decreasing IOP. The goal of this prospective randomized controlled trial is to compare the effect of propofol and sevoflurane on IOP in patients undergoing RALRP in the steep Trendelenburg position with carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum.    ,NCT01744262

Prostate Cancer,Clinical Study Evaluating Targeted Biopsies and Cytological Imprints in Prostate Cancer, The investigators will evaluate the accuracy of performing cytological imprints of targeted biopsies when diagnosing prostate cancer. It is useful to know whether the biopsy is cancer or not in order to know when to stop sampling and when to continue. The strategy is used in other types of cancer e.g lung breast etc    ,NCT01745718
Prostate Cancer,Health Interventions in Men Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy, The goal of the study is to assess the impact of a health intervention involving both diet and exercise modification on outcomes following radical prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer. The specific urological outcomes expected to be improved are accelerated and/or improved recovery of erectile function (EF) as well as urinary continence both very commonly affected by this surgery. Furthermore as demonstrated by changes in responses to various questionnaires an improvement in overall health-related quality of life is expected. Finally an improvement in patients participating in the intervention groups in physical parameters including body mass index (BMI) blood pressure (BP) and metabolic parameters including serum glucose and cholesterol levels is expected.    ,NCT01748110
Prostate Cancer,Pantoprazole and Docetaxel for Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, The main objectives of this trial are:   1. To assess the activity and safety of pantoprazole and docetaxel (with prednisone) in men with metastatic CRPC who have not received prior chemotherapy.   2.

Prostate Cancer,A Pilot Trial of Sonoelastography for Planning Tumor-targeted Prostate Biopsy, Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer death amongst men in the United States. Sonoelastography is an imaging technology predicated on reproducible differences in the backscattered ultrasound signal produced by compression of tissues of varying stiffness. It permits measurement of the elastic properties of tissue. These measurements can be transposed onto conventional anatomic ultrasound images producing a colorized overlay that allows direct visualization of the anatomic distribution of tissue stiffness. In this study we aim to determine whether prostate biopsies planned with sonoelastographic guidance would be more likely than random prostate biopsies to intersect with foci of carcinoma in the prostate gland and to determine whether prostate biopsies planned with sonoelastographic guidance would be more likely than random prostate biopsies to yield histopathology representative of the final Gleason Score obtained at pathologic assessment of the resected prostate.    ,NCT01748890
Prostate Cancer,Best Systemic Therapy or Best Systemic Therapy (BST) Plus Definitive Treatment (Radiation or Surgery), The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if treatment with standard systemic therapy (androgen deprivation therapy or bilateral orchiectomy) in combination with surgery or radiation therapy is more effective at controlling prostate cancer than standard systemic therapy alone. The safety of this treatment combination will also be studied.    ,NCT01751438
Prostate Cancer,3-arm Study of Abiraterone Acetate Alone Abiraterone Acetate Plus Degarelix a GnRH Antagonist and Degarelix Alone for Patients With Prostate Cancer With a Rising PSA or a Rising PSA and Nodal Disease Following Definitive Radical Prostatectomy, In April 2011 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the oral drug abiraterone acetate (Zytiga ®) in combination with prednisone (a steroid) to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received prior docetaxel (chemotherapy). In December 2012 the FDA approved Zytiga ® in combination with prednisone to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy. Degarelix (Firmagon ®) a testosterone lowering agent given as a monthly injection is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate abiraterone acetate and prednisone in combination with degarelix as a possible treatment for PSA recurrent prostate cancer as compared to abiraterone acetate alone and degarelix alone. This will be the first time these drugs will be used together.    ,NCT01751451

Prostate Cancer,Vitamin D3 Supplementation for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Randomized Trial, Vitamin D promotes the differentiation of prostate cancer cells and maintains the differentiated phenotype of prostate epithelial cells. The results of the investigators' clinical studies indicate that vitamin D3 supplementation results in a decrease of positive cancer cores at repeat biopsy in subjects with low-risk prostate cancer. The investigators hypothesize that Veterans who have early-stage prostate cancer and who take vitamin D3 at 4000 international units per day (intervention group) will show an improvement in the number of positive cores and in Gleason score at repeat biopsy and a decreased likelihood of undergoing definitive treatment (prostatectomy or radiation therapy) compared to Veteran subjects taking placebo (control group).    ,NCT01759771
Prostate Cancer,Multiparametric MRI for Prostate Cancer Localization and Characterization: New Methods, The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of several new MRI techniques (MR elastography dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with gadofosveset and oscillating gradient diffusion) to determine the location size and grade of prostate carcinoma. Thirty patients with biopsy proven carcinoma awaiting prostatectomy will be included in the study. Ex-vivo MRI will also be conducted on the prostate specimen to obtain high resolution imaging correlates to both in-vivo MRI and whole mount prostatectomy specimens. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of these three techniques will increase the accuracy sensitivity and specificity of MRI for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer.    ,NCT01761812

Prostate Cancer,Pelvic Floor Muscles Training in Men Undergoing Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Randomized Controlled Trial, The pelvic floor disorders are a major problem in our current society with manifestations of micturition disorders defecatory problems and sexual dysfunction. The pelvic floor muscles training arouses interest due the few studies on this subject. Studies are being conducted with emphasis on the post-prostatectomy urinary disorders however not associated with radiotherapy. The study of the effect of radiotherapy in these muscles is still uncertain. At right we do not know if the effect of radiation can trigger important anatomical changes that could lead to pelvic floor disorders manifesting clinically as defecatory and urinary disorders. These issues motivate us to research focusing on the evaluation of these muscles through magnetic nuclear resonance considering that radiation therapy has been increasingly used as a therapeutic option in the treatment of prostate cancer. The primary objective of this is to verify the effect of pelvic floor muscles training (PFMT) tract symptoms (LUTS) anorectal and sexual complaints in men with prostate cancer (PCa) treated with radiotherapy (RT). Secondly the objective is to evaluate the effect of PFMT in its function and in the severity of urinary incontinence (UI) and evaluate the quality of life. The assessment of the changes occurred by the effect of radiation separately and jointly to the training of the pelvic floor muscles can help us to better understand some of the dysfunctions presented in this sample of patients as well as understanding the effect and the possible contribution of training of these muscles for treatment and/or prevention of these disorders.    ,NCT01762956
Prostate Cancer,Carbohydrate Restriction and Prostate Cancer Growth, No treatments have been shown to slow prostate cancer progression after radical prostatectomy. We hypothesize that a carbohydrate restricted diet will slow prostate cancer growth. A total of 60 men with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after failed primary treatment will be recruited and randomized to either a low-carbohydrate diet (<20 grams carbohydrates/day) or a no-diet control (standard of care) for 6 months. The primary outcome is PSA doubling time.    ,NCT01763944

Prostate Cancer,Quality of Life in Patients With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Treated With Radiosurgery, Quality of life data following SBRT for prostate cancer has been obtained in only a small numbers of patients. A prospective study using validated quality of life questionnaires is needed to determine outcomes after treatment with SBRT. Our study will be the first essential step in developing a better evidence base on the comparative risks and benefits of SBRT treatment with regards to quality of life assessment and outcomes.    ,NCT01766492
Prostate Cancer,Improving Cancer Foci Detection in Prostate Cancer Using Multiparametric MRI/MRS, The investigators' goal is to develop a non-selective and non-invasive procedure to identify aggressive tumors and simultaneously identify their exact location in Prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy by combining multiparametric MRI and machine learning techniques. The combination of multi-parametric MRI and machine learning (validated using histopathology) can lead to increased sensitivity and specificity of cancer foci in the prostate and help in isolating aggressive from indolent tumors. This increased sensitivity and specificity may eventually lead to: a) a reduction in the number of patients that undergo unnecessary treatment and b) enhance current treatment options by enabling the use of focused therapies. The investigators will recruit 15 patients with prostate cancer that are currently scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy into the study. All patients will obtain an advanced MRI study prior to the radical prostatectomy. MRI scans will include a) high-resolution volumetric images using T1 and T2-weighted imaging b) vascular images using dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging c) biophysical microstructure images using diffusion-weighted imaging and d) biochemical images using MR spectroscopic imaging. Following radical prostatectomy a pathologist will grade the prostatectomy specimens based on standard of care (Gleason grading system). Correlations will be generated between the parameters obtained from scans and from clinical assessments.    ,NCT01766869
Prostate Cancer,Choline-PET for Evaluating the Incidence of Nodal Metastases Among Newly Diagnosed Patients of Prostate Cancer, Nodal involvement among patients with prostate cancer is known to be a poor prognostic factor. Traditionally the presence or absence of nodal disease in patients with prostate cancer is ascertained with the use of anatomical imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However the sensitivities of CT and MRI for the detection of pelvic nodal disease is rather low with reports placing the value to lie between 50-80%. Positron emission tomography (PET) with the use of carbon-11 or fluorine-18 tagged choline (Choline-PET) is an approach which is known to deliver a high sensitivity for the imaging of prostate cancer disease burden in the primary nodal and the metastatic areas. The investigators in this prospective trial intend to utilize Choline-PET among all newly diagnosed patients of prostate cancer who are presumed to be non-N1 (absence of nodal disease on conventional imaging) and non-M1 (absence of metastatic disease on conventional imaging).    ,NCT01769950
Prostate Cancer,Study of 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A in Patients With Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this study is to see if a new diagnostic research agent named 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A can show prostate cancer tumors on a PET scan; as well as see how long 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A lasts in the blood when given in small amounts. DFO-MSTP2109A is an antibody that works against STEAP1 - found on the surface of prostate cancer cells. Attached to the DFO-MSTP2109A is a radioactive material called 89ZR which allows it to be imaged by a PET scanner. The results of this study may help researchers know whether 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A can be used as a diagnostic agent for finding prostate cancer that have STEAP1 on its surface with a PET scanner. The reason why identifying STEAP1 on prostate cancer cells is that new therapies are being developed to target STEAP1 prostate cancer cells.    ,NCT01774071
Prostate Cancer,Clinical Management Decisions for Recurrent Prostate Cancer Patients Based on [11C]Acetate PET Scan, When evaluating prostate cancer patients for recurrent disease computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both highly sensitive methods for detecting lymph nodes but are not specific as to whether the lymph nodes are malignant or benign. While positron emission tomography (PET) utilizing radioactive glucose (FDG) has revolutionized staging restaging and monitoring response to therapy in many prevalent cancers such as breast colorectal esophageal head and neck lung lymphoma and melanoma findings with prostate cancer have proven less sensitive because prostate cancer has a lower avidity for glucose. A newer PET isotope utilizing acetate that is incorporated into the cell membrane of rapidly proliferating cells has shown greater sensitivity than FDG in detecting prostate cancer. This study will assess the clinical effectiveness of utilizing [11C]Acetate PET scans in identifying recurrent prostate cancer.    ,NCT01777061
Prostate Cancer,Immune Responses in Prostate Lung Melanoma and Breast Cancer Patients Following Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) or Brachytherapy, Success of cancer immunotherapy is limited by the ability of solid tumors to evade local and systemic antitumoral immune responses. Several mechanisms of tumor immune evasion have been identified including low intratumor expression of antigens and elevated expression of inhibitory co-regulatory molecules. An effective immunotherapy is one which would induce necrotic cell death and accompanying proinflammatory cytokine induction. Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) or Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) or brachytherapy which is capable of delivering high confromal radiation doses (>8 Gy) of tumor ablative radiation may be an effective means of conditioning a tumor bed to a state favorable to the initiation of robust antitumoral immune responses.    ,NCT01777802
Prostate Cancer,Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging Study of Prostatic Fats to Distinguish the Difference Between High and Low Risk Prostate Cancer, A prostate cancer diagnosis starts a list of events that often leads to fast-moving treatment thought by many to result in vast over-treatment of this disease. So discovery of different diagnostic methods that allow clinicians to identify slow-growing from potentially fast-growing disease prior to or at the time of prostate biopsy could result in early and suitable treatment for men at greatest risk while greatly decreasing the number of biopsies surgical procedures hormonal and chemotherapeutic treatments cost and patient worry for those with more slow-growing disease.    ,NCT01780701

The endpoints selected reflect measurable short term effects of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) including quality of life and several metabolic parameters. In addition the relative effect of each treatment strategy on PSA suppression as well as testosterone recovery (and subsequent PSA progression) after 12 months of therapy will be evaluated.    ,NCT01790126
Prostate Cancer,Safety and Efficacy of Irreversible Electroporation in Ablation of Prostate Cancer in Humans, Up to 16 patients with confirmed low- or intermediate risk prostate cancer scheduled for a radical prostatectomy will be asked to have the Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) procedure approximately 30 days prior to the prostatectomy. Ablation with IRE will be performed using similar planning criteria procedure protocol instruments and software used for brachytherapy a conventional targeted radiation therapy where radioactive seeds are implanted into prostate tumours. Patients will have an ultrasound of the prostate and the imaging data will be entered into the Planning Software system. The volume of the prostate is measured and a specified ablation zone will be determined. The IRE will be performed under general anaesthetic and the specified zone identified in the planning stage will be ablated. Four IRE electrode needles will be placed into the prostate under ultrasound image guidance. When the needles are in place electric pulses of one to two minutes duration are used to ablate the specified zone. The total procedure time will be approximately 1 hour. Safety data will be collected and patients will be followed up at 1 week 2 weeks post IRE pre- prostatectomy post prostatectomy and 1 week post prostatectomy. The safety data collection is at 2 weeks post IRE. Before the IRE procedure patients will have a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) of the prostate. The patients will have their scheduled prostatectomy at approximately 30 days after the IRE procedure. Pre-prostatectomy the ablation zone will be radiologically assessed by a control MRI/CEUS. Post prostatectomy efficacy of ablation will be determined by histological examination of the prostate by the Pathology Department and measured as complete or incomplete ablation. The primary outcome is safety as measured by the composite of procedural device and post procedural adverse events measured with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4 (CTCAE) Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) score International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) or required catheterization time and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and efficacy of ablation determined by histological examination post prostatectomy. Secondary outcomes will be patients procedure satisfaction measured by patient satisfaction questionnaire post procedural pain management and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score time to ambulation length of hospital stay.    ,NCT01790451

Prostate Cancer,Observational Non-interventional Non Comparative Real Life Data Collection of Depo-Eligard® 7.5 mg 22.5 mg and 45 mg in Male Prostate Cancer Patients, Tremodi is an observational non-interventional prospective open-label non-comparative study that will collect real life data of a treatment with Depo-Eligard® in 3 different administrations in male prostate cancer patients. Once the examining physician has decided on the therapeutic approach and if the selection criteria are fulfilled he will propose the patient to participate in the study. An informed consent form will be collected for all participants in the study. There are 2 possible study visits that coincide with a routine consultation namely visit 1 (inclusion visit) and visit 2 (end of study visit). On both visits Adverse Drug Reactions (adverse event caused by Depo-Eligard®) are collected and the patient will be asked to complete a Quality Of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). At visit 2 the examining physician will give a global evaluation of the treatment with Depo-Eligard® and assesses the treatment benefit of the patient. Testosterone and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) blood values are collected during both visits if available.    ,NCT01793077

Prostate Cancer,Pilot Study of VTI Doppler Probe Use to Identify Neurovascular Bundle During Prostate Surgery, This study is designed to evaluate the use of a disposable laparoscopic Doppler probe in robotic assisted prostatectomies. The Vascular Technology Inc. (VTI) laparoscopic probe is simply a sterile disposable Doppler probe that can be inserted through a laparoscopic trocar and placed on structures to determine if there is vascular flow demonstrating an audible pulse. During robotic-assisted prostatectomy identification of vasculature is critical in order to prevent hemorrhage and effectively treat the underlying pathology. The investigators routinely utilize a combined Doppler ultrasound laparoscopic probe to identify vasculature during renal surgery but Doppler ultrasound usage has not been adopted for prostatic surgery. From a mechanical standpoint these combination probes differ from the VTI probe in that they are approximately 2 times the diameter of the VTI probe and the portion of the probe utilized for imaging much longer and on the side of the device. The VTI probe is much narrower and the portion of the probe utilized for vessel identification is at the tip of the probe. For robotic-assisted prostatectomy patients will be randomized to VTI laparoscopic Doppler System to identify pedicles and neurovascular bundles (NVB) or to robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with no Doppler probe which is the current standard of care.    ,NCT01794936

Prostate Cancer,Tumor TARGET Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is common in males and may develop over the course of an individual's life. This cancer is often discovered at the time of routine physical examinations and/or blood work or on rectal examination. Once diagnosed most patients do require some form of treatment so that the prostate cancer does not progress to cause damage and/or shortened lifespan. Occasionally after patients receive treatment the investigators have found that an area of cancer remains within the prostate. Those patients with a large area of cancer (i.e. seen on MRI image) appear to have a higher chance of remaining or recurrent prostate cancer even after standard treatment. Thus the investigators believe that the area of the prostate gland occupied by a dense area of cancer may need more radiation therapy than normal to remain cancer free. Standard therapy currently in place in North America: Currently patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer have 3 common options: surgery external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) alone or internal radiation (brachytherapy). Patients may or may not receive hormone therapy alongside the radiation depending on their physician's preference. For those who receive radiation therapy the tumor typically receives the same dose as the rest of the prostate gland. Findings to date: In the past few years the investigators have discovered that patients with a tumor large enough to be seen on MRI images (>5mm) have a higher chance than normal of having cancer remain in the prostate despite receiving treatment for their cancer 3 years earlier. Using new technology investigators can deliver radiation therapy after viewing the prostate tumor on MRI. This guides therapy allowing the radiation treatment to be targeted to the tumor within the prostate. Based on this earlier success the investigators believe that they can now safely give a higher dose of radiation to specifically target the cancer within the prostate gland. Reason for the study: The investigators would like to test this technology and expertise to give radiation to a higher than normal dose to the tumor nodule in prostate gland.    ,NCT01802242
Prostate Cancer,Prospective Study Using Hybrid PET/MRI to Evaluate Men With Suspected Recurrence Following Treatment for Prostate Cancer, Evaluate the impact of hybrid 18F-Fluoro-choline (18F-FCH) PET/MRI imaging on the clinical management of men with suspected recurrent prostate cancer post prostatectomy or radiotherapy. We hypothesize that hybrid imaging incorporating 18F-FCH PET/MRI imaging will be feasible and will lead to changes in management decisions among men being re-staged for suspected prostate cancer recurrence post-surgery or radiation who are potentially eligible for local salvage therapy.    ,NCT01804231

Prostate Cancer,Rituximab Neoadjuvant Therapy in Patients With Prostate Cancer Scheduled to Undergo Radical Prostatectomy, There is now substantial evidence that B cells are recruited into prostate cancers by CXCL13 released by the tumor cells. B cells release lymphotoxin which drives malignant cell proliferation through the NFkB pathway. This is a pilot trial in 18 patients to determine whether depletion of B cells by rituximab will result in a decrease in the extent of B cell infiltration of the prostatic cancer.

Prostate Cancer,Application of Megavoltage Imaging to Reduce Artifact After Seed Implants, This is a non-randomized study to evaluate the utility of MVCT as a quality assurance measure in patients treated with interstitial permanent seed implants for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. All patients will received the same standard of care treatment but will receive an additinoal CT image of the prostate.    ,NCT01810627
Prostate Cancer,Proton Therapy for High Risk Prostate Cancer, The most common treatment for men with high risk prostate cancer is radiation therapy (XRT) followed by long term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Long-term AD is toxic with substantial metabolic physical mental and sexual side-effects. In this study the investigators propose a treatment strategy to optimize the control of high risk prostate cancer by using dose-escalated external beam radiation (proton therapy or IMRT) concurrent with docetaxel and adjuvant short-course AD. The investigators hypothesize that this approach will be superior to the current standard of care and obviate the need for long term AD. In this study subjects will be randomized to either XRT with long term ADT or XRT and chemotherapy and short term ADT.    ,NCT01811810
Prostate Cancer,Prospective Study Comparing Extended With Limited Pelvic Lymphadenectomy in Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy, Prostate cancer is currently the second most common cause of cancer death in men in Western countries. Lymphadenectomy is the gold standard procedure for staging pelvic lymph node and is classically indicated in intermediate and high risk prostate cancer patients and is held at the same time of prostatectomy. A traditionally pelvic lymphadenectomy covers the obturator chain bilaterally. Recently some studies have demonstrated the existence of lymph node involvement outside the traditional boundaries of classical lymphadenectomy recommending therefore extended dissection; this also includes the external / internal / common iliac chains and presacral. Thus lymphadenectomy according to these authors would also has a therapeutic role besides helping in better staging. Although some retrospective studies report an association between lymphadenectomy and tumor progression the exact impact of extended lymphadenectomy in oncological outcome of patients with prostate cancer is not clearly established mainly by lack of prospective randomized studies on the subject . The study objectives are to compare the oncologic results of extended lymphadenectomy versus limited in order to elucidate the role of extended dissection in lymph node staging and results of treatment in terms of increased tumor cure. The investigators also intend to identify patients who may benefit from oncologically extended procedure. To do this the investigators will evaluate prospectively patients diagnosed with prostate cancer at intermediate or high risk indicating lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy. These patients will be randomized to the extended versus limited lymphadenectomy and the investigators will compare the lymph node metastasis and pattern of spread of prostate cancer as well as biochemical relapse-free survival freedom from progression to metastasis and cancer-specific survival.    ,NCT01812902

Prostate Cancer,A Registry for Patients Treated on the Clinical Trial TAX 3503, The purpose of this study is to continue follow-up on patients who were treated on the study called TAX 3505 (MSK IRB #07-101). The sponsor of this study has decided to end the study early before all patients have completed all planned follow-up tests. As a result the investigators do not yet know whether hormonal therapy alone or in combination with docetaxel is better at preventing prostate cancer recurrence in patients who had a rising PSA after prostatectomy. This study will continue following patients according to a schedule that is similar to that found in the TAX 3503 (MSK IRB #07-101) study in order to answer that question. This study is known as a registry study. The patients' will not receive any treatment as part of this study. Instead they will be asked to have a blood test performed once every 12 weeks.    ,NCT01813370

Prostate Cancer,Prospective Randomized Trial of Seminal Vesicle-Sparing Prostatectomy and Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy in Men With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer, Surgical removal of the prostate (radical prostatectomy) is a common and generally effective treatment for prostate cancer. However standard prostatectomy can affect urinary continence and sexual function. Different surgical techniques such as nerve-sparing prostatectomy and seminal vesicle-sparing prostatectomy may limit these treatment-related effects. In a standard prostatectomy the seminal vesicles are removed completely. In contrast during a seminal vesicle-sparing prostatectomy the surgeon leaves a portion of the seminal vesicles intact. This is done because the nerves that are important to urinary continence and erectile function are located close to the seminal vesicles. The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients who undergo nerve-sparing prostatectomy with seminal vesicle-sparing experience better urinary and sexual functioning after surgery than patients who undergo standard nerve-sparing prostatectomy.    ,NCT01825642

Prostate Cancer,Comparison Of Effectiveness of Transrectal Ultrasonography-Guided Saturation Biopsy And 10-12 Core Biopsy In Repeated Prostate Biopsies, OBJECTIVE To assessment the results of repeated saturation and 10-12 core biopsy protocols in patients with a negative initial biopsy but continued suspicion for prostate cancer MATERIALS AND METHOD Data of the patients who underwent prostate biopsy between June 2007 and June 2012 were retrospectively assessed. Patients with an abnormal digital examination findings and/or abnormal serum prostate specific antigen levels were biopsied. The indication for a repeated biopsy was determined as the continued suspicion for a malignancy after the initial benign biopsy result and/or a pathology result consistent with a high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical small acinar proliferation. Patients who underwent saturation and core 10-12 biopsies at repeated biopsies were compared. Statistical analyses were performed with Shapiro-Wilk test and Mann- Whitney U test. A p value less than 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.    ,NCT01827813

Prostate Cancer,Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer - A Pilot Study of Focal Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy, This project will develop and evaluate a treatment plan for prostate focal therapy based on low dose rate brachytherapy. The participants entering this study are those suitable for active surveillance. These participants will be monitored with various imaging methods and interventions such as MR elastography Transrectal ultrasound elastography PET/CT and transperineal mapping biopsy to determine the extent of cancer and suitable treatments. Those suitable for focal therapy will be offered the option of low dose rate brachytherapy (LDRB) focal therapy in addition to active surveillance or radical therapy. This study will be used to evaluate the long term use of multi-modal multi-parametric prostate cancer imaging combining data from MRI ultrasound and 11C-choline PET/CT. Such methods can be used to eliminate the need for invasive methods such as mapping biopsies.    ,NCT01830166
Prostate Cancer,Anatomical and Functional Differences Between Continent and Incontinent Men Post Radical Prostatectomy, One out of every six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and post prostatectomy up to 75% report urinary incontinence. There are many hypotheses about the exact cause of post prostatectomy stress incontinence (PPI). Existing studies have focused on surgical or cadaveric dissections to define structures responsible for PPI. Contemporary 3T MRI now allows three dimensional sub-millimeter resolution of the human pelvis and clearly demonstrates pelvic anatomy without the distortion of dissection. It is our overarching hypothesis that PPI is multifactorial and occurs because of a combination of specific anatomical and functional impairments. We propose conducting a case control study with matching for age and race to compare the MRI anatomy and urinary tract function on urodynamics between 20 men with PPI (cases) and 20 men who are continent post prostatectomy (controls) who are all a minimum of 12 months post surgery. We will use static and dynamic MRI at 3 Tesla to make objective measurements of the bladder neck external urethral sphincter pelvic floor urethral anastomotic fibrosis and urethral hypermobility- all believed to play a large part in continence. Multi-channel urodynamic studies will also be performed to assess the leak point and maximum urethral closure pressure. All cases and controls will complete standardized questionnaires - the AUA symptom index and the Incontinence Severity Index as a quality of life measure. This study is needed to provide critical information about causes of male PPI a quality of life altering voiding dysfunction and will assist with the advancement of pharmacological and surgical treatment of this disease.    ,NCT01832831

Prostate Cancer,Multi-Center Randomized Clinical Trial Irreversible Electroporation for the Ablation of Localized Prostate Cancer, Multi-centre Randomized Clinical Trial: 200 patients with confirmed unilateral high-volume low risk (Gleason score 3 + 3) or intermediate risk prostate cancer (Gleason score 3 + 4) will undergo an IRE treatment. These patients will be randomized into one of the two groups of the study. Group 1: Focal ablation of the prostate at the side of the positive biopsies (focal-ablation) Group 2: Extended ablation of the prostate (extended ablation) Patients will have an ultrasound of the prostate and the imaging data will be entered into the Planning Software system of the IRE-device. The volume of the prostate is measured and a specified ablation zone will be determined. The patients will be admitted for overnight stay in the hospital on the morning of the scheduled IRE procedure. The IRE will be performed under general anaesthetic and the specified zone identified in the planning stage will be ablated. Two to four IRE electrode needles will be placed into the prostate under ultrasound image guidance with a perineal approach using a brachytherapy grid. When the needles are in place electric pulses of one to two minutes duration are used to ablate the specified zone. The total procedure time will be approximately 1 hour. Safety data will be collected and patients will be followed up at 1 day post-operatively 1 month 3 months 6 months and 1 2 and 3 year(s) post IRE.    ,NCT01835977

Prostate Cancer,A Couple Support Intervention for Prostate Cancer, Even with careful prostate surgery men find it difficult to have an erection. Our previous research shows that couples are not often supported to cope with the effects of surgery on their sexual relationships. In this study the investigators will design a way of supporting couples and test how well it works. The investigators will decide what the support should include (e.g. duration frequency and timing of the support). The investigators will do this by looking at available literature on the subject. The investigators will recruit 68 couples to the study half will receive standard care and the other half will be invited to attend six sessions of psychosexual support with specially trained professionals (trained by men affected by prostate conditions and a cancer/couple support specialist). Before and after the support men and their partners will be asked to complete questionnaires which measure quality-of-life emotional needs and their relationship. The investigators will ask the couples to fill out the questionnaires again six-months later to see if the support has long-term benefits. At the end of the study the investigators will also interview 10 couples to find out their views of the support and another 10 couples about standard treatment. When the investigators have tested this support they expect to see men and their partners tell us that their quality of life has improved and they have higher satisfaction with their relationship. The investigators will calculate the overall cost of providing this support and the benefits it has on reducing the need for other health-care services (like General Practice use).    ,NCT01842438

The investigators have hypothesized that this treatment technique will effectively control the prostate cancer while minimizing the side effects.    ,NCT01856855
Prostate Cancer,A Phase II Prospective Study of MRI in the Reclassification of Men Considering Active Surveillance in Prostate Cancer, Some men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer do not require immediate treatment. Rather they can be followed closely with regular physical exams blood work and repeated biopsies of the prostate. If the prostate cancer is becoming more aggressive curative treatment can be offered at that time. This strategy of delaying treatment until necessary is called active surveillance in prostate cancer. Active surveillance is a way of monitoring prostate cancer which aims to avoid or delay unnecessary treatment in men with less aggressive cancer. Prostate cancer can be slow growing and for many men the disease may never progress or cause any symptoms. In other words many men with prostate cancer will never need any treatment. Treatments for prostate cancer may cause side effects which can affect your quality of life. By monitoring the cancer with regular tests you can avoid or delay these side effects. Active surveillance is generally suitable for men with low risk early stage prostate cancer that is contained within the prostate gland (localized prostate cancer). If doctors had a better way of identifying who might be best suited for this approach it would likely become more appealing for more men. In this study the investigators are looking at how accurate a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is at identifying high-risk prostate cancer which might make a man a poor candidate for active surveillance. To do this the investigators are collecting data from the MRI scan of men and comparing it to a trans-rectal biopsy performed following the scan. The results of this study will help inform doctors how accurate the MRI is in identifying men who should not be on active surveillance.    ,NCT01858688

Prostate Cancer,Improved Prostate Cancer Diagnosis - Combination of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Biomarkers, Prostate cancer has been the most common cancer in men in Finland over the last ten years. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) plays an important role in screening of prostate cancer. However PSA has a limited sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection. Commonly the diagnosis of prostate cancer is done by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guided biopsy. Due to the low accuracy of TRUS a systematic biopsy is usually performed instead of targeted TRUS biopsy. As biopsy carries a risk of increase in complications there is an increasing interest in developing more accurate non-invasive imaging modalities. This study will enroll 150 men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer due to higher serum level of PSA than 2.5 ng/ml and/or abnormal digital rectal examination. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) at 3 Tesla (T) magnetic field using surface coils will be used to non-invasively predict the presence or absence of prostate cancer. Targeted TRUS guided biopsy based on MRI findings will be performed in addition to routine twelve core TRUS biopsy. Moreover selected serum and urine biomarkers as well as biomarkers extracted from fresh biopsy sample will be collected and correlated with the presence or absence of prostate cancer.    ,NCT01864135
Prostate Cancer,Enzalutamide With or Without Vaccine Therapy for Advanced Prostate Cancer, Background: - Enzalutamide is a hormone therapy that is used to treat advanced prostate cancer. It is given after chemotherapy and surgery to help the body destroy the cancer cells. A new possible way of treating prostate cancer is using a vaccine that may help stimulate the immune system. It will help white blood cells recognize and kill the cancer cells in and around the prostate. Researchers want to see whether this vaccine given with enzalutamide is more effective at treating advanced prostate cancer than enzalutamide alone. Objectives: - To compare the safety and effectiveness of enzalutamide with and without vaccine therapy for advanced prostate cancer. Eligibility: - Men at least 18 years of age who have advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be used to monitor the cancer before treatment.   -  Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will have enzalutamide and the study vaccine. The other group will have enzalutamide alone.   -  All participants will take enzalutamide once a day. They will take the drug during 4-week cycles of treatment.   -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Participants will continue to take the study drug for as long as the cancer does not grow and the side effects are not severe.   -  The vaccine group of participants will also have the new study vaccine. They will have a single injection on the first day of the first study cycle. There will be regular booster injections afterward. There will be one on day 15 of the first cycle the first day of the second cycle. The vaccine will then be given every 4 weeks for the next four cycles and then every 12 weeks (every 3 cycles) thereafter. Participants will continue to have the study vaccine for as long as the cancer does not grow and the side effects are not severe.    ,NCT01867333
Prostate Cancer,Gadoxetate Enhanced Imaging Study to Detect Prostate Cancer, Background: - Prostate cancer is the most common cancer type among men. Some prostate cancers respond to hormonal therapy. However some cell characteristics of other prostate cancers cause it not to respond as well to these therapies. Researchers want to see if gadoxetate a contrast agent used to help identify damaged liver tissue can help tell these types of prostate cancer apart. It may be able to identify if a man has a type of prostate cancer for which hormone therapy may not work as well. Objectives: - To see if gadoxetate can help identify different types of prostate cancers during imaging studies. Eligibility: - Men at least 18 years of age who have prostate cancer. Participants will be having surgery to either remove the prostate or take tumor tissue samples. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples will be collected.   -  Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the lower torso. They will receive gadoxetate during the MRI scan.   -  Participants who have surgery will have a sample of their tumor cells collected. Those who have a biopsy will provide cells from this biopsy for study.   -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.    ,NCT01867424
Prostate Cancer,Abiraterone With Different Steroid Regimens for Side Effect Related to Mineralcorticoid Excess Prevention in Prostate Cancer Prior to Chemotherapy, The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and clinical benefit of the combinations of abiraterone acetate and prednisone or abiraterone and dexamethasone in prostate cancer patients. Prednisone will be given at one of three different dose schedules. Dexamethasone will be given at one dose schedule. This will include looking at what side effects occur and how often they occur. In addition the impact of the study drug on quality of life and pain will be evaluated. The study will also collect data on subsequent treatment of patients after they come off the study drug (up to a maximum of 5 years after the study starts). By analyzing blood samples the study aims to identify if some markers could help to understand if the treatment with abiraterone is effective and also help to understand if patients can become resistant.    ,NCT01867710
Prostate Cancer,Shorter Duration Radiotherapy to Treat Prostate Cancer After Removal of the Prostate," Radiation therapy is one of the standard treatments for men with prostate cancer who have detectable levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA a prostate cancer specific marker) after surgery. When radiation therapy is given to patients who have an increase in PSA after surgery it is called ""salvage radiation therapy"". Currently the standard radiation therapy course length for this type of cancer is around 7 ½ -8 weeks. Sometimes radiation therapy after prostate removal causes unpleasant side effects. A shorter course of radiation therapy known as a ""hypofractionated"" course gives fewer but higher doses of radiation than standard radiation. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a shorter course of radiation therapy at progressively lower dose levels and shorter lengths of treatment (hypofractionated) with patients who have had their prostate removed. The study will assess whether the hypofractionated course works better without causing additional side effects to the remaining cancer cells in the prostate bed.    ",NCT01868386
Prostate Cancer,Enzalutamide in Combination With PSA-TRICOM in Patients With Non-Metastatic Castration Sensitive Prostate Cancer, Background: - Enzalutamide is a well tolerated hormone therapy that is used to treat advanced prostate cancer. It is given to help kill cancer cells and limit cancer cell growth. A new possible way of treating prostate cancer is using a therapeutic cancer vaccine (immune stimulating therapy) that may help activate the immune system against the cancer. The immune stimulating vaccine will help white blood cells recognize and kill the cancer cells throughout the body. This vaccine therapy has been tested in hundreds of patients and is very well tolerated. Researchers want to see whether this vaccine given with enzalutamide is more effective at treating advanced prostate cancer than enzalutamide alone. Objectives: - To compare the safety and effectiveness of enzalutamide with and without vaccine therapy for advanced prostate cancer. Key Eligibility:   -  Men at least 18 years of age who have advanced castration sensitive prostate cancer.   -  Patients must have testosterone within the normal range   -  No evidence of metastatic prostate cancer on CT or Bone scan   -  No history of autoimmune diseases   -  No previous immunotherpy within 3 years Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be used to monitor the cancer before treatment.   -  Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will have enzalutamide and the study vaccine. The other group will have enzalutamide alone.   -  All participants will take enzalutamide once a day. They will take the drug for 3 months. This form of intermittent therapy is common in this population of patients.   -  The vaccine group of participants will receive the new study vaccine. They will have a single injection on the first day of the first study cycle. There will be regular booster injections afterward. There will be one injection during the third week of treatment and one in the fifth week. The vaccine will then be given every 4 weeks until 21 weeks have passed.   -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.    ,NCT01875250

It is hoped that this technique will help doctors provide a higher-quality image of the prostate cancer making it easier to plan the area that will be treated. Using this type of CT scan will also lessen the amount of time patients spend in the scanner. This study will not offer patients a different treatment for their prostate cancer. Patients will receive the most appropriate standard treatment whether or not they are in this study.    ,NCT01878773
Prostate Cancer,Tivozanib + Enzalutamide in Adv Prostate Cancer," This research study is a Phase II clinical trial which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational combination of drugs to learn whether they work in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that the combination of drugs is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it such as the safest dose to use and the side effects they may cause. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the combination. The two drugs being tested in this study are tivozanib and enzalutamide. Enzalutamide has been approved by the FDA for treatment of prostate cancer. On the other hand tivozanib is still investigational and has not been tested in a combination with enzalutamide before. Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist (it blocks the activity of the male sex hormones). Prostate cancers are initially dependent on the male hormone testosterone for growth. Hormonal therapies that lower testosterone or block the ability of testosterone to act at the level of the prostate cancer are currently among the most effective treatments for prostate cancers taht have spread to other body organs (metastasized). The effectiveness of hormonal treatments however is not permanent and over time many prostate cancers progress in spite of these treatments. Enzalutamide is a drug that has been proven to help delay the progression of advanced prostate cancer on average for about 8 months. Tivozanib is an anti-angiogenesis medicine that fights different types of cancer by blocking the blood supply to the tumor so that the tumor does not receive the nutrients it needs to grow. The main goal of this study is to determine whether the combination of tivozanib and enzalutamide is more effective in delaying the progression of disease than when enzalutamide is given alone. This study will also determine whether treatment with the combination of the tivozanib and enzalutamide will have more side effects then treatment with enzalutamide alone.    ",NCT01885949

Prostate Cancer,Periperal Blood Lymphocytes During Prostate RT, Right now it is not possible to predict which patients are going to react more to RT. Many things could affect patient's response to radiation. One of the factors is whether the person can repair damage to the genetic material (DNA/RNA) caused by the RT. There is some evidence that a certain protein called Gamma H2AX is involved in DNA damage and repair and this can be used to predict the sensitivity of individual patients. The investigators will be studying this protein: Gamma H2AX) in the blood samples of prostate cancer patients exposed to both computed tomography (CT) scan and RT treatment. This will help us to understand why different individuals show differences in side effects following RT.    ,NCT01899391

Prostate Cancer,Radiotherapy of the Prostate and the Pelvic Lymph Nodes After Neoadjuvant Antihormonal Treatment, For patients with prostate cancer and a high risk of lymph node involvement or confirmed pelvic lymph node metastases radiotherapy of the whole pelvis is a treatment option. However conventional radiotherapy of the pelvis has limited by gastrointestinal and urogenital side effects. The PLATIN trial investigates an intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic drainage that spares small bowel bladder and rectum. A higher dose is given during each session to the prostate or the prostate bed and to confirmed lymph node metastases. Prior to radiotherapy two months of neoadjuvant antihormonal treatment are required and continuation during radiotherapy and for a further two years are strongly recommended.    ,NCT01903408
Prostate Cancer,Perioperative Changes of Cognitive Function According to Jugular Vein Insufficiency in Robot-assisted Prostatectomy, Internal jugular vein (IJV) is the main pathway of cerebral venous drainage and it has valve system to prevent retrograde blood flow to the brain. Anatomical studies revealed that bicuspid or tricuspid valves were located in both jugular veins 2 cm above the subclavia-jugulars bifurcation and 7-18% of the valves were incompetent. IJVV incompetence (IJVVI) may result in retrograde flow which leads to brain congestion and increase of intracranial pressure which can cause brain dysfunctions in some patients. IJVVI has been reported to be associated with transient global amnesia (TGA) cough syncope exertional headache transient ischemic attack and air embolism. Demographic data are associated with the development of IJVVI. Akkawi et al. demonstrated that old age over 50 years and male gender are the risk factors for IJVVI. A few physiologic conditions are related with IJVVI including elevated intra-thoracic and intra-abdominal pressure and pulmonary hypertension. Robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RLP) is one of the most common robotic surgery because of its significant benefits such as smaller incision less severe postoperative pain less intraoperative bleeding and shorter hospital stay compared to traditional radical prostatectomy. The patients undergoing RLP are mostly over 60 years old have neurologic cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities. For RLP patients are in Trendelenburg position most of the time during surgery which could cause increases in intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressure.    ,NCT01905488
Prostate Cancer,Dose Escalation to Dominant Intraprostatic Lesions (DIL) With MRI-TRUS Fusion High Dose Rate (HDR) Prostate Brachytherapy, The Magnetic Resonance (MR) provides high resolution of soft tissue images allowing an appropriate assessment of the local extent of the disease. Recent studies have shown an increase in sensitivity and specificity for the detection of Dominant intraprostatic lesions when using multiparametric MRI as a diagnostic tool in the staging of the disease. Among the various irradiation techniques currently available for prostate cancer Brachytherapy is the superior in terms of dose conformation; this conformation allows greater dose escalation adjusting the isodoses to the prostate with exquisite accuracy keeping healthy adjacent organs such as the urethra and rectum in a tolerable dose range Brachytherapy companies have recently developed software allowing for TRUS-MR image fusion. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of the delivery of a higher than prescription dose to the dominant intra-prostatic nodule as defined on multiparametric MRI. Dose to prostate and adjacent structure will remain the same as the current treatment practice. Timing and the delivery of brachytherapy will not change from our current practice    ,NCT01909388
Prostate Cancer,Resistance Training and Protein Supplementation in Increasing Lean Body Mass for Prostate Cancer Survivors Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy, This randomized pilot clinical trial studies resistance training and protein supplementation in increasing lean body mass in patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy.

Prostate Cancer,Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to Guide Differential-Dose Prostate Brachytherapy, In standard prostate brachytherapy treatment the seeds are placed throughout the prostate to treat the entire gland. This is done because in the past it was impossible to know where the cancer was located within the prostate. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify tumor(s) with a high degree of accuracy. This trial will assess whether using MRI to guide prostate brachytherapy can result in less chronic toxicity by allowing lower doses to be delivered to the regions of the prostate without tumor while simultaneously allowing higher doses to the tumor. Subjects enrolled in this study will then be followed over two years and evaluated for toxicity. In addition after two years they will undergo an MRI and a biopsy to assess the cancer control rate of the treatment.    ,NCT01913197
Prostate Cancer,Measurements Of Zinc Concentration On Specimens Taken During Trans-Perineal Prostate Biopsy, The purposes of this study are to: i) confirm and improve the accuracy of the correlation between levels of Zinc in prostate tissue and the grade of prostate cancer in that tissue as determined through pathology; and ii) determine the levels of zinc in prostate tissue declared as non-cancerous by pathology and located in the vicinity of tissue declared as cancerous by pathology and verify that the Zinc levels for the declared non-cancerous tissue are lower (statistically significantly) than the levels for benign tissue not in the vicinity of cancerous tissue.    ,NCT01915316
Prostate Cancer,Radiosensitizing and Radioprotectve Effects of Curcumin in Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the second most incident cancer among male population worldwide. Radiation therapy by itself or along with surgery and chemotherapy are the main treatments for prostate cancer however prostate cancer cells are only modestly responsive or even unresponsive to the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy. Recently some in vitro and in vivo studies showed radiosensitizing and radioprotective effects for curcumin. No clinical trial has been done in this area and it is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective with or without curcumin supplements in treating patients with prostate cancer.    ,NCT01917890
Prostate Cancer,Hypofractionated Radiotherapy as Primary Therapy for Prostate Cancer, External beam radiotherapy (RT) is one of the standard curative treatment options for patients with prostate cancer (PC). Several randomised trials have shown excellent long-term biochemical outcome with higher radiation doses. Nowadays RT for PC commonly consists of delivering 74-80 Gy in 2 Gy fractions resulting in an overall treatment time of 7-8 weeks. The sensitivity of different tissues to fractionation changes can be quantified through the α/β ratio in the linear-quadratic model. Dose-response analysis of PC patients treated with both external beam RT and brachytherapy has led to the hypothesis that the α/β ratio of PC is lower than for most other tumors and approaches a value characteristic of late responding tissues. Values between 1.2 and 3.9 Gy have been calculated. If the α/β ratio of PC is indeed low then hypofractionating RT treatments can theoretically maintain high bioequivalent tumor doses shorten overall treatment time and decrease late toxicities.The advantages in terms of patient convenience and treatment cost are obvious. There is level I evidence that shows that hypofractionated radiotherapy schedules have at least equivalent biochemical outcome with only a small increase in acute but not late toxicity when compared to conventional fractionation RT schedules. Results on different hypofractionation schedules have been reported however the optimal hypofractionation is not clear so far. In this randomised trial we would like to compare 2 different radiotherapyschedules: 16 fractions à rato of 4 fractions a week versus 25 fractions à rato of 5 fractions a week. The incidence on acute toxicity and early late toxicity (i.e. within 2 year post radiotherapy) and the impact on quality of life will be registrated and compared. The study will be performed in 2 stages. For stage 1 sample size was calculated to rule out an upper limit of 40% of patients with RTOG grade 2 or worse bowel (GI) complications with an expected rate of 25% based on a one-stage Fleming-A'Hern design. A power of 83.0% (alpha level 0.038 one-sided) was obtained when including 72 patients per group (144 patients in total). If 22 or more patients out of 72 had grade 2 or worse GI complications then the study arm was to be rejected. To allow for a dropout of 10% 160 patients were included in stage 1. Sample size for stage 2 was calculated analogously allowing ruling out an upper limit of 35% of patients with RTOG grade 2 or worse GI complications with an expected rate of 25%. When including 155 patients per group (310 in total) a power of 85.7% (alpha level 0.049 one-sided) was obtained. If 45 or more patients out of 155 had grade 2 or worse GI complications then the study arm was to be rejected. The sample size for stage 1 and stage 2 combined was set at 346 (173 per group) with a 10% allowance for dropout.    ,NCT01921803
Prostate Cancer,Improving Quality of Life After Prostate Brachytherapy: a Comparison of HDR and LDR Brachytherapy," Optimal non surgical treatment of prostate cancer requires dose escalation which is frequently provided by adding a brachytherapy ""boost"" to a short course of external beam radiotherapy. The hypothesis in this randomized study is that a High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost leads to equivalent or better Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival when compared to a Low Dose Rate (LDR) brachytherapy boost and that it is associated with a more favorable toxicity profile and improved quality of life.

Prostate Cancer,Phase II Trial of Enzalutamide for Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer With Correlative Assessment of Androgen Receptor Signaling, This research study is evaluating a drug called enzalutamide in metastatatic castration resistant prostate cancer.Enzalutamide is already FDA approved for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer after treatment with chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to analyze features of tumor specimens sampled prior to therapy and at disease progression to determine why patients respond or stop responding to treatment with Enzalutamide. Prior chemotherapy is not a requirement of this trial. Enzalutamide is a drug designed to block the effects of male hormones in the body that may be helping prostate cancer to grow. It has already been approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received prior chemotherapy. Additionally this study will analyze features of tumor specimens sampled prior to therapy and at disease progression to determine why patients respond or stop responding to treatment with enzalutamide.    ,NCT01942837
Prostate Cancer,Abiraterone Acetate Plus LHRH Agonist and Abiraterone Acetate Plus LHRH Agonist and Enzalutamide, The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding the combination of abiraterone acetate and prednisone with or without enzalutamide to hormonal therapy can help to control prostate cancer when given before surgery. The safety of the drug combination will also be studied.    ,NCT01946165
Prostate Cancer,Effect of Sulforaphane on Prostate CAncer PrEvention, The biology of prostate cancer is associated with changes in genes and metabolites within prostate tissue. There is robust evidence to suggest that a diet rich in broccoli can prevent or retard the development of prostate cancer by influencing these changes. This is likely to be due to a natural chemical that is obtained in these vegetables known as sulforaphane. In this study we are seeking to provide further evidence that a diet rich in broccoli may prevent prostate cancer from developing and to understand how this may happen. We propose to undertake a human intervention study to test the hypothesis that a broccoli-rich diet can alter the metabolism and gene expression within prostate tissue of men under active surveillance in a manner that would reduce the probability of the emergence and progression of aggressive cancerous clones. Participants recruited onto this study will be randomly allocated to one of three dietary groups in which they will be required to consume one portion per week of a broccoli soup delivering a different concentration of sulforaphane. This will be part of their normal diet for one year. Blood urine and prostate biopsy tissue will be obtained before and after a 12 month intervention period. Prostate biopsies will be obtained either though transperineal template biopsies a technique accepted as best clinical practice because it provides better sampling of the prostate or transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy which is currently the standard of care for obtaining biopsies. This study has been funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and Prostate Cancer foundation (PCF).    ,NCT01950143
Prostate Cancer,Hypofractionated Proton Beam Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer, The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if delivering proton therapy in higher doses per treatment may help control prostate cancer just as well as the standard of care treatment. The safety of this treatment will also be studied. Radiation dose is measured in units called Gray (Gy). The standard of care treatment schedule for proton therapy is 1.8-2 Gy given 1 time per day 5 days per week over a period of 8-9 weeks.    ,NCT01950351
Prostate Cancer,Prostate Guided Biopsy Study Evaluating the Diagnostic Performance of Prostate HistoScanning, The primary objective of the PHSTT-01 trial is to determine if prostate HistoScanning (HS) analysis can be used to improve the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa) and potentially reduce the burden and number of biopsies in routine clinical practice. Prostate HS is an ultrasound-based tissue characterization technology specifically developed to detect visualize and locate tissue suspected of harboring PCa. These suspicious tissues are displayed as red areas on an imaging monitor. Recently a new biopsy guidance tool has been developed that uses the results of the prostate HS analysis. The subjects that will participate in this study are all scheduled for a first biopsy of the prostate. They will initially be imaged using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) to obtain data for prostate HS analysis. The results of HS analysis will be used later in the procedure. Subjects will then undergo a routine systematic 10- to 12-core biopsy procedure using TRUS. This will be followed by a TRUS-guided biopsy that uses the result of prostate HS analysis and new biopsy guidance tool.    ,NCT01950871
Prostate Cancer,SABR Including Regional Lymph Node Irradiation for Patients With High Risk Prostate Cancer (SATURN), Current treatment options for high risk localized prostate cancer include radical prostatectomy +/- postoperative radiotherapy radical radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy. Evidence has emerged that prostate cancer has a low α/β ratio in the range of 1-3 Gy. Even with high risk tumors prostate cancer is hypothesized to have a greater sensitivity to large fraction sizes and high dose per fraction radiotherapy theoretically allows for biological dose escalation with fewer visits and no additional toxicity. Therefore we hope to determine the toxicity quality of life biochemical and pathological control of SBRT for high risk prostate cancer incorporating ENI.    ,NCT01953055

Prostate Cancer,Circulating Tumor Cell Analysis in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Prostatectomy, This study will evaluate a method to detect tumor cells that are circulating in the blood without getting a biopsy. The investigators already know from other studies that cancer tumors shed a small number of cells into the bloodstream every day. These are called circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Some early studies indicate the amount and type of CTCs in the blood can help determine the status of the tumor itself and the way it is responding to treatment. In this study the investigators will compare the number of CTCs in the blood at different time frames before and after surgery to remove the prostate.    ,NCT01961713
Prostate Cancer,Abiraterone Acetate for Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer, This research study is a Pilot clinical trial. Pilot clinical trials often examine new tests (such as laboratory or radiology tests) in patients who receive either standard cancer treatments or new treatments that have been well-tested in many patients on other trials. It is often difficult to determine how prostate cancer is going to behave when a new treatment is started. Physicians have no way to predict how a patient's tumor will respond to treatment. Although scientists have learned about changes that happen in tumors due to treatment it is difficult to get cells from tumors because a biopsy (surgical procedure to remove a small piece of tissue) is needed. This study will evaluate a method to detect tumor cells that are circulating in the blood without getting a biopsy. It is known that tumors shed a small number of cells into the blood stream every day. These are called circulating tumor cells or CTCs. Some early studies indicate the amount and type of CTCs in the blood can help determine the status of the tumor itself and the way it is responding to treatment. In this study the investigators will examine protein levels in CTCs from patients' blood at different times before and after drug treatment to determine if they correlate with response to the drug. The new test will not affect whether subjects continue on the study drug. Abiraterone acetate is a marketed drug that has been studied for the treatment of metastatic CRPC. It blocks the remaining or residual male hormones in the body that may be helping prostate cancer to grow. Abiraterone acetate is now FDA-approved for patients with metastatic CRPC who have not yet received docetaxel chemotherapy. Abiraterone acetate has been used by a large number of participants in previous clinical trials. In most of these trials participants with CRPC have been given abiraterone acetate with prednisone. Prednisone is a man-made hormone commonly referred to as a steroid. Prednisone has been approved in the US Canada and Europe for various disorders and diseases such as asthma Lupus and chronic obstructive lung disease. The combination of prednisone with abiraterone acetate has been approved for the treatment of CRPC. Prednisone together with abiraterone acetate will be given in this study in order to reduce or eliminate some side effects. Investigators will use patients' blood samples to study the genes (also called DNA) and their products (RNA and proteins) found in CTCs.    ,NCT01961843

This study will evaluate the feasibility of the NanoKnife??System as a focal therapy.    ,NCT01972867
Prostate Cancer,Efficacy Study Evaluating Chemotherapy in Prostate Cancer, This clinical trial is designed on the basis of an unmet clinical need as well as other factors including: 1) the ability to identify subjects at high risk of dying early from their disease 2) the fact that hormonal therapy has already been shown to improve survival when applied early in the natural history 3) the availability of chemotherapy such as cabazitaxel that can improve survival in subjects with advanced disease and 4) that chemotherapy (docetaxel) given concomitant with hormone treatment has proven to prolong time to progression. It is the investigators hypothesis that a more appropriate group of patients who may benefit from the curative potential of systemic chemo-hormonal modality is that with minimal but detectable disease who have a high probability of developing metastatic disease clinical symptoms and eventually death from prostate cancer in a defined time frame. The investigators hypothesize further that the approach is likely to be more effective at a time of minimal tumour burden resulting in minimization of the overall burden of therapy and better quality of life while on treatment. This trial will determine whether any benefit is gained by adding chemotherapy before hormonal therapy to hormonal therapy alone in the population of subjects with metastatic or high risk disease.    ,NCT01978873
Prostate Cancer,MRI Temperature Mapping of the Prostate and Urogenital Pelvis Cooled by an Endorectal Balloon, Urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction are potential side effects for men undergoing the successful removal of the cancerous prostate via surgery. Hypothermic cooling via the investigational Endorectal Cooling Balloon has been shown by our group to significantly reduce long term urinary incontinence and may reduce sexual dysfunction in men after robotic prostatectomy and improve the patient's long term quality of life (QOL). However before successful translation of the endorectal balloon can proceed into the world wide usage we must understand:   1. How effectively the tissues for continence and sexual function are cooled within the pelvis.   2. What is the capacity of vascularized structures (i.e. the neurovascular bundle) to 'cool sink' or diminish the effective cooling and   3. Determine if the endorectal balloon can be re?designed for improved QOL outcomes in men. This research study marries two new techniques of Thermal MRI imaging and Endorectal cooling for prostate cancer surgery. MRI is non?invasive. A simple confirmation of effective hypothermic cooling can be achieved by novel MRI thermal mapping of the cooling gradient as it comprehensively sweeps through the rectum across the urogenital pelvis. MRI with temperature adaptive software can accurately map these gradients with non?invasive technique and answer formidable questions of the effectiveness of hypothermic cooling of the prostate and its direct translation into improved continence and sexual function after surgery. The purpose of this research study is to use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Thermal MRI with subjects who will receive the investigational endorectal cooling balloon to help further understand how the cooling balloon works which may translate to other uses in the future including the diagnosis of patients at a high risk of developing prostate cancer.    ,NCT01979848

Prostate Cancer,Intra-operative Trans-rectal Ultrasound Guidance for Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy, Radical prostatectomy or the surgical extirpation of the prostate is a standard treatment for prostate cancer. The state of the art radical prostatectomy involves a robotic laparoscopic surgery system (the da Vinci) which provides the surgeon with excellent 3D visualization of the surgical site and improved dexterity over standard laparoscopic instruments. While the long term prognosis of prostate cancer patients who undergo radical prostatectomy has improved significantly over the past two decades there remain significant rates of disease recurrence and complications. The investigators hypothesis is that advanced trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging can be deployed and used easily during surgery can be registered to the robot coordinate systems with high accuracy and can be controlled from the surgeon's console in order to improve the visualization of the prostate and peri-prostatic anatomy and in order to produce a cancer probability map that can be used to make decisions on surgical margins. The investigators objectives are   1. To demonstrate that TRUS imaging can be integrated with the da Vinci radical prostatectomy   2. To determine the ability of TRUS imaging to intra-operatively visualize the prostate and peri-prostatic tissue from the surgical console This is an observational study; trans-rectal ultrasound will be used to visualize the prostate and periprostatic structures during surgery but the standard of care will not be affected by this ultrasound imaging.    ,NCT02001597

Prostate Cancer,Fusion Targeted Biopsy of the Prostate, The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate a new molecular image directed three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound guided biopsy system in human patients. The current biopsy uses ultrasound imaging as guidance. However the procedure uses two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound images and has sampling errors thus some cancers can be missed from the standard 2D image-guided biopsy. In this study an FDA-approved ultrasound device will be used to obtain three-dimensional (3D) images of the prostate from a commercially available ultrasound scanner. The clinician can use the 3D images to guide biopsy record the core location of the biopsy sites and perform re-biopsy to the same sites in a patient follow-up examination. This system can also use images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) and then fuse PET or MR images with 3D ultrasound images to guide the needle to a suspicious tumor target as seen on MRI or PET. We think that this fusion targeted biopsy technology will help to improve the accuracy of the current systematic biopsy approach for prostate cancer detection.    ,NCT02013414

Prostate Cancer,Prostate Cancer Genomic Heterogeneity, The purpose of this study is to carry out very detailed genetic testing on prostate cancer cells. The reason to do this is because researchers do not fully understand   -  How prostate cancer develops   -  Why some cancer cells spread and others do not   -  Why some cancer cells respond to treatment and others do not Researchers and doctors know that 1 in 3 of the male population over the age of 50 has cancer cells in their prostate. However most of these men will never know they have it and it will not affect their quality of life or their life expectancy. However some cancers can be aggressive. These are more likely to spread outside of the prostate and cause problems. Doctors do not have an accurate way to tell the difference between aggressive cancer and those which will not cause any problems. Even within one prostate some tumours are aggressive and others do not cause a problem during the lifetime of a patient. In fact even within one tumour different cells may behave differently. In other words one part of the tumour may be aggressive and spread whilst another part of the same tumour does not. This project will try to find out more about what makes different tumours and different parts of the same tumour aggressive or harmless. It is important to find out what makes some cancer cells spread and others stay where they are. For the investigators to do this they need to collect fresh samples of cancer tissue from the prostate and from different areas of a tumour within the prostate. This is because biopsies used to diagnose or exclude cancer by the hospital laboratory are not good enough to give investigators detailed genetic information. These biopsies have been put into a chemical called formalin which reduces the quality of the genetic information. Investigators are therefore asking patients who are undergoing prostate biopsies as part of their normal care to allow them to take additional biopsies for the purpose of this study. This may be the first time patients are having biopsies. Or patients may be having biopsies after treatment that has been given for the cancer and the doctors are concerned the treatment is not working.    ,NCT02022371

Prostate Cancer,Magnetic Nanoparticle Thermoablation-Retention and Maintenance in the Prostate:A Phase 0 Study in Men, Men with early prostate cancer face a number of options which lie at the extremes of care. On one hand active surveillance involves monitoring the disease and on the other immediate treatment involves surgery or radiotherapy. The difference between these two strategies in terms of reducing the chance of a man dying from his disease is small. Not only is the benefit small surgery or radiotherapy carry significant side-effects. These occur because of damage to surrounding tissue resulting in incontinence of urine (1 in 5) erectile dysfunction (1 in 2) and back-passage bleeding diarrhoea or discomfort (1 in 10). The investigators have been working on new forms of treatment that use heat light or cold to destroy tissue and minimise treatment-related harms. The investigators have not yet found one that delivers the ideal treatment. The ideal treatment is one that can be done under local anaesthetic can effectively destroy areas of cancer limit damage to surrounding tissues is repeatable and adaptable to future discoveries such as molecular targeting of cancer cells. The investigators think magnetic thermoablation may be able to deliver on these ideal attributes. Magnetic thermoablation involves injecting magnetic iron nanoparticles directly into the cancer. When a magnetic field is applied close to them these nanoparticles heat up to very high temperatures that kill cells. Magnetic thermoablation does not use x-rays or surgical incisions. The investigators have done a lot of the preclinical work already to develop this type of treatment. The investigators now need to develop a system that can be used to treat prostate cancer. However before the investigators can do this they need to test whether the magnetic nanoparticles actually stay where they are injected. The consequences of them moving to areas that they should not can be serious. First the nanoparticles could move away from the cancer which means the cancer will not be heated effectively. Second the nanoparticles could move to sensitive structures around the prostate (back-passage bladder sphincter muscle controlling urine flow nerves controlling erections). If this happens damage of those sensitive structures could occur leading to side-effects. The investigators propose a study to try and find out what happens to those nanoparticles. The study will involve approaching men who are having their prostates removed by radical surgery. If these patients agree to participate the investigators will inject their prostate with varying amounts of nanoparticles. The investigators will NOT heat them up. The investigators will use special scans and once they have had their surgery to look at the pathology specimens to see where the nanoparticles have gone. The actual nanoparticles are not harmful but the process of injection can carry a small amount of harm. If the nanoparticles stay where they are injected the investigators will then be able to run another study in which we treat men who have prostate cancer with magnetic thermoablation.    ,NCT02033447

Prostate Cancer,Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment, RATIONALE: Radical prostatectomy is surgery to remove the entire prostate. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells. Sometimes the tumor may not need treatment until it progresses. In this case active surveillance may be sufficient. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective for localized prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying active monitoring to see how well it works compared with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy in treating patients with localized prostate cancer.    ,NCT02044172
Prostate Cancer,An Exercise Trial and Economic Analysis in Men With Prostate Cancer, Prostate Cancer (PC) affects 1 in 7 men. Nearly half of those diagnosed with PC will receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as part of their treatment. ADT is good at managing PC but has many side effects. Researchers have shown that exercise specifically one-on-one supervised exercise improves many of the side effects of ADT. However exercise programs for men on ADT are not widely available. More questions need to be answered in order for exercise programs to become part of PC treatment. First can programs that require fewer resources such as group-exercise or home-based exercise also improve ADT side-effects? Second do exercise-related benefits continue beyond the structured exercise program? And what makes people continue exercising? Third which exercise program is most cost-effective? In this study the investigators will compare: (a) group supervised in-centre; (b) home-based supported; and (c) 1:1 supervised in-centre exercise programs to see which program is most effective for men with PC on ADT. The investigators will also look at what motivates people to continue to exercise both during a structured program and after the program is complete and will examine which exercise program is most cost-effective. The investigators will ask men with PC on ADT that are being treated at either Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto or the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary to participate in the study. When a patient agrees to participate he will be randomly placed in 1 of the 3 exercise programs. All programs will include the same type of exercises (aerobic resistance and flexibility) and all participants will exercise 4-5 days per week for 30 minutes per day (as tolerated) for the length of the program (6 months). The investigators will look at how men with PC on ADT respond to the exercise program by measuring quality of life (QOL) fatigue and different physical measures before during and after the exercise program. Although the investigators know that supervised one-on-one exercise is most effective at improving ADT side-effects it is unknown if other forms of exercise are just as beneficial and more financially responsible. This study will allow the investigators to begin to answer these questions so that structured exercise programs become a regular part of PC treatment.    ,NCT02046837
Prostate Cancer,Phase 1-2 Study of Onapristone in Patients With Advanced Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer, This is an open-label randomized parallel group two-stage phase 1-2 study with an escalation and an expansion component.

A companion diagnostic to select patients whose prostate cancer expresses the activated form of the PR (APR) is under development and will be implemented in this study; it may be used to further enrich the selection of the population based upon ongoing review of the results. Patients will be treated until occurrence of an intolerable safety issue treatment failure if patient elects to withdraw or for non-compliance with either protocol-specified evaluations or onapristone treatment. An additional cohort of patients will be included at the recommended phase 2 dose to gain additional understanding of the onapristone safety profile and potential anti-cancer activity.    ,NCT02049190
Prostate Cancer,Orteronel Maintenance Therapy in Patients With mCRPC Previously Treated With Novel Hormonal Agents, The main object of this multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase III trial is to assess impact of maintenance of orteronel on disease progression and hence on quality of life of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer pretreated with novel hormonal agents who have non-progressive disease after chemotherapy with a taxane.    ,NCT02053311
Prostate Cancer,Phase Ib/II Study Evaluating Orteronel (Without Prednisone) Combined With Itraconazole In Men With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), This research is being done to test the safety and anti-cancer activity of the combination of an investigational drug called orteronel with a drug called itraconazole in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Orteronel is an investigational drug known as a 1720-lyase enzyme inhibitor meaning that it blocks the formation of male sex hormones. Itraconazole is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of various fungal infections such as fingernail/toenail infections and other more serious fungal infections. While it has shown evidence of activity against prostate cancer in prior studies it is not approved for use in cancer. The FDA is allowing the use of orteronel and itraconazole in this research study. In addition to its antifungal properties itraconazole was discovered to function to block angiogenesis (blood vessel formation to tumors) to block a cellular pathway thought to be important in prostate cancer known as the Hedgehog pathway. Investigators hypothesize that blocking male sex hormone production with orteronel will increase reliance on the Hedgehog pathway in prostate cancer cells which can then be blocked with itraconazole and that the combination of these two drugs will be more effective than either alone.    ,NCT02054793

Prostate Cancer,Salvage Therapeutic Radiation With Enzalutamide and ADT in Men With Recurrent Prostate Cancer (STREAM), The purpose of this study is to describe the 2 year progression-free survival in men with recurrent PSA-only disease after prostatectomy receiving combined enzalutamide and standard androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with salvage radiation therapy. Eligible men will have recurrent PSA-only prostate cancer within 4 years of prostatectomy and a PSA of 0.2 - 4 in the absence of metastatic disease on CT and bone scans. In addition to standard ADT and radiation therapy research participants will take enzalutamide once daily for six months. It is primarily hypothesized the 2 year PFS rate will be improved with the combined therapy compared to the historical control data in a similar patients setting.    ,NCT02057939

The researchers are interested in evaluating the safety and tolerability of the vaccine and the effects of the vaccine on survivability time to measurable disease prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in the blood and the immune response to the vaccine. Eligible patients include those with recurrent prostate cancer as shown by elevated levels of PSA although there is no evidence of tumors that are measurable by imaging studies. In addition to be eligible patients must have prostate cancer that either has not been treated by hormonal therapy or is not responsive to hormonal therapy.    ,NCT02058680

The investigators hypothesize that the addition of Palbociclib to initial ADT (Androgen Deprivation Therapy) in patients with newly metastatic RB-positive prostate cancer may significantly increase the efficacy of ADT.    ,NCT02059213
Prostate Cancer,PET Imaging in MCI Following ADT for PCa, Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with ageing is thought in part to be related to reduced serum sex hormones which is well-recognized especially in females but poorly understood. International studies assessing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to prevent/reduce MCI are ongoing. MCI leads to morbidity reduced quality of life and substantial healthcare costs. The commonest therapeutically induced reduction in sex hormone level in men is treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). PCa is androgen dependent and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) suppressing testosterone to castrate levels is key therapy for advanced disease. About one million men worldwide have received ADT for PCa mostly using luteinising hormone releasing hormone agonists (LHRHa) although oral oestrogens were used in the past; eventually perhaps 4% of Caucasians may be castrated. MCI as a side effect of castration in men remains poorly researched. This study aims to demonstrate that pathological changes occur in the brains of a significant proportion of prostate cancer patients subjected to ADT that correlate with MCI symptoms. Highlighting the pathological changes of MCI should improve understanding and interventions for slowing/preventing MCI in PCa survivors. Brain scans employing positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique will be used to detect the presence of pathological changes in the brain that relate to ADT induced MCI. MCI will be assessed by neuropsychological assessments (standard paper-based questionnaires and online) and its neural basis will be investigated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).    ,NCT02061345

Prostate Cancer,Investigating the Effects of AZD2014 Therapy Given Prior to Radical Prostatectomy in Men With High Risk Prostate Cancer, Patients with localised prostate cancer can be treated by radical prostatectomy (prostate gland removal surgery) or radiotherapy. Around 15% of men with prostate cancer are diagnosed with high risk disease meaning they are more likely to suffer treatment failure disease progression and mortality. To date little progress has been made towards identifying effective treatment strategies that might delay or prevent disease recurrence in this patient population. Better identification of patients at high risk of relapse and improvements in therapy are therefore research priorities. A protein named Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is known to play an important role in the development of prostate cancer. mTOR forms two protein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) and sends signals helping cancer cells to grow while controlling their energy use. Blocking the function of mTOR with an inhibitor such as AZD2014 might shut down the supply of energy supply to tumour cells leading to reduced cell growth and potentially slowing the progression of the disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate the molecular pharmacology of AZD2014 treatment given to patients with prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy. The feasibility safety and tolerability of a short course of AZD2014 will also be assessed.    ,NCT02064608

Prostate Cancer,A Study of Dovitinib With Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Receiving Primary ADT, This study will evaluate if adding the investigational drug Dovitinib to standard androgen ablation therapy (ADT) is beneficial in prolonging the time to disease progression in patients with metastatic prostate cancer who are receiving ADT for the first time. Dovitinib belongs to the class of drugs known as tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors. Tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors have been shown to have anti-tumor effects and inhibit new blood vessel formation. New blood vessel development is necessary for the growth and spread of certain tumors such as prostate cancer. It is thought that by inhibiting new blood vessel formation any existing or new tumors may be unable to grow. Dovitinib targets existing cancer cells and also works to stop the formation of new blood vessels. Patients will be randomly assigned to received ADT alone or ADT plus Dovitinib. ADT will be administered per standard of care. Dovitinib will be taken by mouth once daily for 5 continuous days followed by 2 days with no Dovitinib. This schedule will repeat and continue until disease progression or removal from treatment for other reasons. Participants may start ADT prior to entering the study; however treatment with Dovitinib must begin no later than 120 days from the start of ADT. Participants will be asked to donate blood samples for research purposes; this is an optional part of the study. Research on blood samples will study circulating tumor cells and certain biomarkers (proteins on cells) to increase the understanding of prostate cancer and explore if certain biomarkers can help predict how tumors will react to treatment. Samples of existing tumor tissue will also be examined for research purposes.    ,NCT02065323

Prostate Cancer,Robot-Assisted MRI-Guided Prostate Biopsy, Prostate biopsies are commonly performed freehanded under transrectal ultrasound guidance (TRUS). Due to the manual approach and the limitations of the ultrasound imager the procedure has high false-negative rates. This represents a daily problem for urologists managing the disease creates uncertainty and emotional stress for patients and initiates a cascade of repeat testing and biopsies which also burden the investigators healthcare system. The investigators believe that prostate biopsy can be improved by using a new biopsy paradigm. The investigators plan to perform MRI-guided prostate biopsies with robot-assistance for orienting a needle-guide through which the biopsy is taken. The combination of MRI and robotic precision is expected to improve prostate biopsy sensitivity compared to regular TRUS biopsies. The study is a Pilot clinical trial on 5 patients to primarily assess feasibility and safety. The needle-guide robot is an investigational device developed in their Urology Robotics Laboratory.    ,NCT02080052

Prostate Cancer,Prostate Hypoxia - TIC, Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in Canadian men. In 2006 greater than 250000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States and Canada with more than 32000 men dying of their disease. Using the prognostic variables of T-category the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and the pathologic Gleason score (GS) men with localized prostate cancer are placed in low intermediate and high-risk groupings. Usually this is treated with surgery radiation therapy hormone therapy and/or watchful waiting (also known as active surveillance). While these treatments are quite effective tumours are likely to recur in about 40% of cases. There is a need for additional prostate cancer treatments. To address this need many experimental therapies are being developed and tested in mice with prostate tumors. This includes the study of aggressive prostate cancer cells such as stem cells or Tumour Initiating Cells (TICs) or oxygen deprived cells which may be the ones most likely to re-grow into a tumour or spread throughout the body. Researchers want to try and isolate these special cells from the prostate after surgery to study their features and to see if they can re-grow as solid tumours in mice. Researchers would like to test whether the prostate cancer stem cells are more resistant or less resistant to treatments. This will allow researchers to study and test new treatments that specifically target resistant and aggressive prostate cancer cells. The investigators hypothesize that marker-defined TIC cells or hypoxic cancer cells have unique genetics in primary prostate cancers and are relatively chemo- and radio-resistant.    ,NCT02095249

Prostate Cancer,Sexual and Urological Rehabilitation to Men Operated for Prostate Cancer and Their Partners, Today prostate cancer (PC) treatment with curative intent is primarily surgical removal of the prostate gland (prostatectomy) which may be associated with immediate and long lasting erectile dysfunction and decline in urinary function. Besides these physical late effects patients operated for PC have a twofold increased risk for depression up to ten years after the diagnosis. To reduce these late effects affecting both patient and partner the investigators have developed a sexual and urological intervention (PROCAN). The intervention is based on epidemiological data evidence from previous clinical trials a feasibility study and qualitative explorations among PC patients and partners. The investigators hereby suggest the conduction of a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of the PROCAN intervention on urological and sexual dysfunction couples adjustment and quality of life. Results of the proposed trial may provide clinicians and decision makers with the evidence needed to optimize rehabilitation after PC.    ,NCT02103088

Assessment will look at quality of life physical factors and biomarkers associated with secondary disease.    ,NCT02108613
Prostate Cancer,Evaluation Of Transperineal Ultrasound For Image Guidance In The Treatment Of Prostate Cancer in Men Following Prostatectomy, This study is being done to find out if transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) can help define the prostate bed for radiation treatment planning and improve upon current methods of image guidance for the treatment of prostate cancer. For the patient TPUS involves the placement of an ultrasound probe on the perineum the skin between the scrotum and anus while they are lying on their back in the position they will receive their treatment. Image-guidance is required for the treatment of prostate cancer because the prostate bed shifts position depending on how full the bladder and rectum are. Image-guided radiation therapy has been done at Fletcher Allen Health Care for approximately three years. Most commonly transabdominal ultrasound images are obtained every day and compared to an ultrasound that was done on the day of treatment planning. Adjustments in radiation field position can be done on a daily basis by comparing these images. Transperineal ultrasound has never been used for image-guidance. We completed two phases of an earlier study and have developed a TPUS device and process that allow us to get clear ultrasound pictures of the prostate gland and now we would like to explore imaging the prostate bed left after radical prostatectomy.The TPUS has three potential advantages over the transabdominal method we currently use:   1. Transabdominal ultrasound can be a challenge for some men. A full bladder helps us get clearer images however it is difficult for some men with prostate cancer to comfortably keep a full bladder. It is also particularly difficult to get good images in larger men who have long distances from the skin surface to the prostate bed. TPUS is not dependent on a man having a full bladder and should be less dependent on the size of the man.   2. TPUS images and the planning CT images can be acquired simultaneously. This is not possible with the abdominal probe because it gets in the way of the CT machine. Simultaneous imaging eliminates the possibility of the prostate bed shifting positions during the time between imaging studies.   3. TPUS can be in place and acquire images during patient treatment (the abdominal probe gets in the way of the treatment machine) and may in the future allow us to watch the prostate bed during treatment. If we discover that we can accurately view the prostate bed in real time TPUS may ultimately allow us to treat even smaller radiation fields and possibly decrease the risk of radiation complications. Patients in this study will be treated for their prostate cancer with the standard image guidance technique used at Fletcher Allen Health Care: transabdominal ultrasound. In addition one TPUS scan will be acquired at the time of the initial simulation. To summarize the two objectives of this study are:   1. To determine if TPUS can acquire usable clinically pertinent IGRT images of the prostate bed.   2. To preliminarily compare TPUS images of the prostate bed to images obtained with CT and TAUS.    ,NCT02110667

Prostate Cancer,Cultured Circulating Tumor Cells in Prostate and Other Cancers," The purpose of this study is to evaluate the number of circulating tumor cells (CTC) before and after treatment using an experimental method for detecting CTC compared to commercial CTC assay results in patients with prostate breast or colorectal cancers. Experiments will be done to develop a new assay technique and also test how CTC react to commonly used drugs. This information will be analyzed to determine if the experimental assays can be helpful in the future to predict how a patient's cancer may react to certain treatments. The research experiments will also attempt to grow CTC for long-term or ""immortal"" cell lines that can be further studied for proteins and gene mutations related to the specific tumor (not familial) and testing for sensitivity to drugs. Blood samples will be collected at specific time points during routine medical care from patients with prostate breast colorectal or other solid tumor cancer. Samples will also be collected from patients with no cancer for comparison purposes. Samples for the experimental tests will be identified only by codes and results will not be shared with participants. Patients with prostate breast or colorectal cancer will also have blood samples drawn for commercial CTC assays as part of their standard care.    ",NCT02123862
Prostate Cancer,Simultaneous CBCT Acquisition During Arc Radiotherapy, The cone beam image is a part of the radiotherapy treatment machine and uses lower energy xrays as the head of the radiotherapy machine moves around the patient in a circle. This takes pictures that give 3-dimensional information somewhat like a CT scan. These images are better at showing the position of the tumour and surrounding soft tissues than the standard xrays that were previously used. Cone Beam Imaging Technology is not new and has been used regularly at The Christie for many years. The standard cone beam scan is taken before the actual radiotherapy treatment or after the treatment has been delivered. Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT or Arc Radiotherapy) is a novel method of delivering radiotherapy that involves the continuous movement of the radiotherapy treatment machine head around the patient and MLC during radiation. Arc radiotherapy has been clinically implemented at The Christie for prostate radiotherapy treatments and work is in progress for implementation in lung radiotherapy. The continuous gantry rotation inherent to VMAT delivery makes this simultaneous imaging possible although there are concerns associated with the impact that this may have on patient dose and image quality. The aim of this research is to assess whether the image quality of cone beam scans taken during treatment are as good as standard cone beam scans taken before or after treatment used to determine the accuracy of patient position and the tumour coverage by radiotherapy.    ,NCT02123888

Prostate Cancer,MRI Before Biopsy in Diagnosing Patients With Prostate Cancer, This pilot clinical trial studies how well magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before biopsy works in diagnosing patients with prostate cancer. MRI is a procedure in which radio waves and a powerful magnet linked to a computer are used to create detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This diagnostic procedure may aid in identifying lesions in the prostate which may have cancer. The lesions can then be targeted during the prostate biopsy to improve the accuracy of identifying prostate cancer.    ,NCT02131207
Prostate Cancer,PET/MRI for Men Being Considered for Radiotherapy for Suspected Prostate Cancer Recurrence Post-Prostatectomy, The PROPS trial is for men being considered for radiotherapy due to the suspicion that their prostate cancer has recurred following the surgical removal of their prostate (prostatectomy). This suspicion is based on rises seen on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) blood tests. Only men who demonstrate the absence of disease on standard imaging scans (Computed Tomography (CT) and bone scans) will be invited to participate. This study will be assessing if the imaging probe 18-F Fluorocholine (18F-FCH) used during Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans can better predict who will benefit from radiotherapy by identifying the source of cancer recurrence. This will be determined by measuring the number of men who have disease identified outside of the prostate bed (the small pocket or depression where the prostate used to be) on their 18F-FCH PET scan. Since F-18-FCH has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting prostate cancer that may have spread into lymph nodes or bone it may potentially identify areas of prostate cancer spread not seen with standard imaging.    ,NCT02131649

Prostate Cancer,A Phase II Neoadjuvant Study of Enzalutamide Abiraterone Acetate Dutasteride and Degarelix in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer Pre-prostatectomy, This study investigates the pathologic effects of the combination of enzalutamide abiraterone acetate dutasteride and degarelix when given for 12 weeks prior to prostatectomy in men with localized prostate cancer. Enzalutamide an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist blocks binding of testosterone to the AR as well as preventing nuclear translocation of the AR and DNA binding. Abiraterone acetate inhibits the CYP17 pathway which is involved in the formation of androgens. Dutasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor which blocks conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. Degarelix a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist binds to GnRH receptors on the pituitary gland thus suppressing testosterone release from the testes. Therefore it is hypothesized that the combination of enzalutamide abiraterone acetate dutasteride and degarelix will result in near-complete AR inhibition and produce favorable pathologic changes after 12 weeks of therapy.    ,NCT02159690

Prostate Cancer,Point in Time of Radiotherapy for Patients With Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Carcinoma, PSA-recurrence prostate carcinoma is associated with two general problems.   1. Localisation of PSA-recurrence is unconfident. In many cases it's not clear if a local locoregional oder systemic relapse is available.   2. There is no standard therapy proved by randomised clinical trials. Recommended radiotherapy starting with PSA-value < 0.5 ng/ml according to german S3 guidelines is based on retrospective data. These difficulties may lead to a therapy potentially not adapted to patients situation of disease.This study aims to randomised examine if an instant radiotherapy of prostate PSA-recurrence (PSA-value between 0.2 - 0.99 ng/ml) or a delayed radiotherapy with additional imaging (PSA value >= 1 ng/ml) including PET/CT and bone scintigraphy for reliable information about tumor location and expansion is beneficial regarding therapy efficiency quality of life and social economic aspects.    ,NCT02181192

Prostate Cancer,MRI and Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer has been the most common neoplastic disease in men in Finland over the last ten years. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) plays an important role in screening of prostate cancer. However PSA has a limited sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection. Commonly the diagnosis of prostate cancer is done by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guided biopsy. Because of the low accuracy of TRUS a systematic biopsy is usually performed instead of targeted TRUS biopsy. As biopsy carries a significant risk of complications there is an increasing interest in developing more accurate non-invasive imaging modalities. This prospective multi-institutional study will enroll 400 men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer due to higher serum level of PSA than 2.5 ng/ml and/or abnormal digital rectal examination. Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) at 1.5/3 Tesla (T) magnetic field using surface coils will be used to non-invasively predict the presence or absence of prostate cancer. Targeted TRUS guided biopsy based on MRI findings will be performed in addition to routine twelve core TRUS biopsy. Moreover selected serum and urine biomarkers as well as biomarkers extracted from fresh biopsy sample will be collected and correlated with the presence or absence of prostate cancer.    ,NCT02241122
Prostate Cancer,The Miami MAST Trial," 1. Multiparametric MRI ultrasound (MRIus)-guided or direct MRI-guided biopsies will allow for more directed sampling of the tumors from compartments with distinct multiparametric-MRI (MP-MRI) characteristics termed habitats that will increase the rate of ""progression"" on early (first and second) surveillance biopsies and decrease the rate of ""progression"" on late (third and further) surveillance biopsies compared to historic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy rates.   2. Identifying higher risk tumor early on will reduce the proportions of patients with poor response to delayed primary treatment.   3. Radiomics signatures from MP-MRI will define patterns that are associated with progression.   4. Genomic signatures based on RNA from tumor tissue will define patterns that are associated with habitats and radiomics signatures as well as progression.    ",NCT02242773
Prostate Cancer,Phase II Laser Focal Therapy of Prostate Cancer, Target recruitment: 1000 subjects. The purpose of this research study is to continue to investigate the safety and effectiveness of using MR (magnetic resonance) guided laser focal therapy for prostate cancer and to evaluate oncologic control over 20 years. We hypothesize that laser focal therapy can be used to achieve oncologic control in carefully selected patients. MR uses large magnets to produce pictures of areas/organs inside the body. The laser uses light to heat a target area to try to destroy cancerous cells. The laser system that will be used is called the Visualase® Thermal Therapy System. This system has been used for the treatment of brain bone (spine) thyroid and liver cancers. However; this study is the first time this system has been studied for use in the treatment of prostate cancer with a trans-rectal approach. MR-guided biopsies and laser applicator placement will be performed using the Invivo DynaTRIM trans-rectal biopsy guidance system. This system is cleared (approved) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for such uses.    ,NCT02243033

Prostate Cancer,Salvage Radiotherapy Combined With Hormonotherapy in Oligometastatic Pelvic Node Relapses of Prostate Cancer, There is an increasing number of reports describing the existence of a proportion of prostate cancer patients who present with a reduced number of metastases (<5 lesions) at relapse. This oligometastatic status has also been recognized in other tumor types such as melanoma soft tissue sarcoma liver lung and breast cancer and has influenced the management of these malignancies in that a more radical treatment such as surgical resection has been employed. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) studies with tracers such as choline or acetate are reliable tools to help with the diagnosis of oligometastatic disease after biochemical treatment failure in prostate cancer. An aggressive treatment combining androgen depriving therapy (ADT) and and high-dose irradiation to the oligometastatic lesions as detected by PET-CT may be proposed for these oligometastatic patients. Such a treatment strategy may hypothetically succeed to prolong the failure-free interval between two consecutive ADT courses or even cure selected patients with limited metastatic burden. In this study the investigators plan to assess biochemical or clinical relapse-free survival at 2 years of prostate cancer with 1-5 oligometastases treated concomitantly with high-dose conformal Radiation Therapy and LH-RH agonists.    ,NCT02274779

Prostate Cancer,Quantitative Prostate Cancer Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound, Background: Bracco has released the VueBoxTM-Prostate software aimed at distinguishing prostate cancer from prostate benign peripheral zone (PZ) at contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using SonoVue® as contrast agent. The software analyses the ascending phase of enhancement (wash-in) and calculates the mode and the dispersion (sigma) of the wash-in rate in a given region of interest. The diagnosis of cancer is based on the combination of these two parameters. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of the VueBoxTM-Prostate software in distinguishing prostate cancer from normal PZ at contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The secondary objective is to evaluate the diagnostic value of the wash-out rate the time to peak the transit time and the area under the enhancement curve (parameters not used by the VueBoxTM-Prostate software) in distinguishing prostate cancer from prostate benign peripheral zone at contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The study will enroll patients referred for prostate biopsy. The US transrectal probe will be inserted and the local anesthesia performed as per the institution's standard of care protocol. Then the biopsy operator will choose an axial plane likely to contain cancer (e.g. based on MRI or Digital rectal examination results). Half a vial (2.4 ml) of SonoVue® will then be injected and the ultrasound enhancement of this plane will be recorded during 2 minutes while the biopsy gun is already in place. Then the biopsy will be taken while the recording is still on so that it will be possible to calculate quantitative enhancement parameters at the exact location of the biopsy. Then the operator will choose a plane that is likely not to contain cancer in the opposite prostate lobe and the same process will be repeated with injection of the second half of the vial. The rest of the biopsies will be performed as per the institution's standard of care protocol. The two recordings will be sent to Bracco's Research center in Geneva in order to:   -  Predict the biopsy result (cancer vs benign) based on the VueBoxTM-Prostate software results   -  Calculate the wash-out rate the time to peak the transit time and the area under the enhancement curve at the biopsy location. The two biopsy samples performed after the injection of SonoVue® (as the rest of the biopsy samples) will be processed and analysed at the institution's department of Pathology and their results will be blinded to the Bracco's Research center. The correlation between the biopsy results the VueBoxTM-Prostate software results and the wash-out rate time to peak transit time and area under the enhancement curve will be performed by the study investigator. In total 130 patients will be included (hypotheses of 20% of malignant biopsy cores and of an area under the ROC curve of 0.85 for the VueBoxTM-Prostate software).    ,NCT02295449

The investigators want to find out if we can find and monitor changes in cancer using a FDHT PET scan.    ,NCT02297386
Prostate Cancer,Randomized Multi-center Clinical Trial Comparing Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Boost to Conventionally Fractionated Combined With Androgen Deprivation Therapy in a High Risk Group of Prostate Cancer Patients, The main purpose of study is to compare the effectiveness of Hypofractionated IMRT boost Radiotherapy to Conventional IMRT boost Radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients combined with Androgen Deprivation Therapy.    ,NCT02300389
Prostate Cancer,Randomized Trial of Prostate Only or Pelvic RT in High Risk Prostate Cancer, Evidence to justify the use of the pelvic field is lacking for men with high risk localized prostate cancer. An additional randomized study is needed in men with a potential risk of nodal involvement to test the hypothesis that the use of the pelvic field contributed to the benefit observed in those studies. This trial aims to compare the outcomes with whole pelvis RT and Prostate alone RT in patients with High risk non metastatic Prostate cancer with a Lymph nodal >20% with Primary 4 year Biochemical failure free survival and Secondary Disease free survival overall survival Acute toxicity Late toxicity and QOL Patients will be randomized to one of two arms Arm 1 Whole pelvis radiotherapy and Arm 2 Prostate only radiotherapy. The Dose prescription will be 66 Gy in 25 fractions will be prescribed for the prostate PTV in Arm 2 an additional 50 Gy in 25 fractions for nodal PTV in patients in Arm 1. An overlap volume at rectal-prostate interface will receive 64 Gy/25#. All patients will receive hormone therapy starting at least 8 weeks prior to the beginning of radiotherapy. They will continue the hormone therapy and later for a total duration of 2-3 years.    ,NCT02302105
Prostate Cancer,MRI-Targeted Focal Ablation of the Prostate in Men With Prostate Cancer, This is a prospective single center trial to examine the rate of negative biopsy result and quality of life after focal ablation by radiofrequency energy. The primary evaluation involves assessing the rate of negative biopsy result using MR-US fusion biopsy six months after focal ablation of the prostate. Urinary and sexual quality of life will be assessed through validated measures. The hypothesis of our study is that focal ablative therapy will result in a greater likelihood of negative biopsy on followup biopsy than that observed in men who elect not to undergo therapy.    ,NCT02303054
Prostate Cancer,Comparative Study of Radiotherapy Treatments to Treat High Risk Prostate Cancer Patients, In North America the number of new cases of prostate cancer increases every year. Many efforts have been made to develop more efficient and safer curative treatments for high risk prostate cancer patients. This phase III clinical trial is designed to compare the safety of a standard pelvic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) combined with a high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRB) boost (direct insertion of radiation source over a period of minutes via flexible needles temporarily inserted in the prostate) to a shorter course of hypofractionated dose escalation radiotherapy (larger radiation dose per daily treatment) in patients with high risk prostate cancer. The investigators plan to recruit 296 patients across Quebec who will be randomized in either treatment plan.    ,NCT02303327
Prostate Cancer,MRI-Guided Prostate Boosts Via Initial Lattice Stereotactic vs Daily Moderately Hypofractionated Radiotherapy, The BLaStM clinical trial extends the Phase I LEAD trial and compares the LEAD upfront technique for increasing dose to the MP-MRI defined GTVs to the HEIGHT method of using a moderate hypofractionated simultaneous integrated boost to the MP-MRI defined GTVs through the course of radiotherapy. The hypothesis is that alternate mechanisms of cell death including bystander effects are put in place when doses above 8 Gy per fraction are used in a lattice and that the effects on local tumor eradication will be greater using this strategy.    ,NCT02307058
Prostate Cancer,Transurethral Ultrasonic Imaging For Detection and Classification of Prostate Cancer," This study is being performed to verify the ability to use minimally invasive transurethral ultrasonic imaging technology for the purpose of identifying prostate cancer. Transurethral ultrasonic prostate imaging may in the future be used for detection and monitoring these disease processes to minimize the need for obtaining surgical biopsy specimens. The hypothesis is that tissue-density variations as revealed in diagnostic ultrasonic imaging results in unique image signatures for identification of prostate cancer. This imaging procedure provides a multifaceted view of the entire in-situ gland. The current use of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) for determining the likelihood of presence of cancer in the prostate gland requires interpretation and has a good but limited to predict prostate cancer on biopsy with significant false prediction rates. More importantly as a blood test the PSA test lacks the ability to pinpoint the location of the cancer within the prostate gland. Preliminary study findings have suggested that ""Transurethral Ultrasonic Scanning"" (TUUS) presents the desired improved diagnostic sensitivity for detection of cancer within the imaged prostate gland and has the intrinsic capability to provide high resolution images of the transverse and future three-dimensional views of the entire gland better than currently used Transurethral Ultrasound (TRUS). Two important goals of the practicality of this minimally invasive technology will be assessed by this study. 1. The ability of TUUS to directly detect prostate cancer locations in the prostate. 2. The use of TUUS to successfully guide the prostate needle biopsy to cancer loci with a high rate accuracy.    ",NCT02307552
Prostate Cancer,Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer, External beam radiotherapy (RT) is one of the standard curative treatment options for patients with prostate cancer (PC). Several randomised trials have shown excellent long-term biochemical outcome with higher radiation doses. Nowadays RT for PC commonly consists of delivering 74-80 Gy in 2 Gy fractions resulting in an overall treatment time of 7-8 weeks. The sensitivity of different tissues to fractionation changes can be quantified through the alpha/beta ratio in the linear-quadratic model. Dose-response analysis of PC patients treated with both external beam RT and brachytherapy has led to the hypothesis that the alpha/beta ratio of PC is lower than for most other tumors and approaches a value characteristic of late responding tissues. Values between 1.2 and 3.9 Gy have been calculated. If the alpha/beta ratio of PC is indeed low then hypofractionating RT treatments can theoretically maintain high bioequivalent tumor doses shorten overall treatment time and decrease late toxicities.The advantages in terms of patient convenience and treatment cost are obvious. There is level I evidence that shows that hypofractionated radiotherapy schedules have at least equivalent biochemical outcome with only a small increase in acute but not late toxicity when compared to conventional fractionation RT schedules. Results on different hypofractionation schedules have been reported however the optimal hypofractionation is not clear so far. In this randomised trial we would like to compare 2 different radiotherapyschedules: 16 fractions à rato of 4 fractions a week versus 25 fractions à rato of 5 fractions a week. The incidence on acute toxicity and early late toxicity (i.e. within 2 year post radiotherapy) and the impact on quality of life will be registrated and compared. The study will be performed in 2 stages. For stage 1 sample size was calculated to rule out an upper limit of 40% of patients with RTOG grade 2 or worse bowel (GI) complications with an expected rate of 25% based on a one-stage Fleming-A'Hern design. A power of 83.0% (alpha level 0.038 one-sided) was obtained when including 72 patients per group (144 patients in total). If 22 or more patients out of 72 had grade 2 or worse GI complications then the study arm was to be rejected. To allow for a dropout of 10% 160 patients were included in stage 1. Sample size for stage 2 was calculated analogously allowing ruling out an upper limit of 35% of patients with RTOG grade 2 or worse GI complications with an expected rate of 25%. When including 155 patients per group (310 in total) a power of 85.7% (alpha level 0.049 one-sided) was obtained. If 45 or more patients out of 155 had grade 2 or worse GI complications then the study arm was to be rejected. The sample size for stage 1 and stage 2 combined was set at 346 (173 per group) with a 10% allowance for dropout.    ,NCT02311049
Prostate Cancer,Evaluation of Treatment Response Using Multiparametric MRI After Prostate Radiotherapy, The purpose of this study is to better understand prostate cancer changes after radiation treatment through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is an imaging test that allows doctors to see prostate gland without any operation procedures. It can help identifying the tumors in the prostate. For patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer MRI may help doctors manage treatment better and sooner.    ,NCT02312401

Prostate Cancer,C-arm Cone-beam CT in Prostate Brachytherapy, The investigators will assess the feasibility of intraoperative use of C-arm cone-beam CT imaging for intraoperative dosimetric evaluation in prostate low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy. Patients recruited are those who will receive standard LDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer treatment. Consenting patients will undergo additional 3D C-arm cone-beam CT imaging (3D C-arm) and motorized trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS). Volumetric and dosimetric measures will be compared to those using the standard Day-0 CT images. The investigators hope that the intraoperative 3D C-arm provides quality assurance measures sufficient to eliminate the need for Day-0 CT LDR brachytherapy and provide the opportunity for intraoperative modification of seed delivery plan.    ,NCT02322931
Prostate Cancer,Studying the Effects of Olaparib (± Degarelix) Given to Men With Intermediate/High Risk Prostate Cancer Before Radical Prostatectomy, Despite recent advances in the treatment of Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) there remains an unmet medical need to identify and optimise additional treatment for those patients with early prostate cancer who are at greatest risk of relapse following first-line treatment with curative intent. This is a phase I study investigating the feasibility and tolerability of a short course of neoadjuvant treatment with olaparib either as a monotherapy or in combination with degarelix) given in the window-of-opportunity prior to radical prostatectomy in men with early localised intermediate-/high- risk prostate cancer. Our primary objective is to determine the pharmacodynamic biomarker effects of olaparib (a PARP inhibitor) in this patient population. Participants will receive either single agent olaparib or olaparib in combination with degarelix (androgen deprivation) for two weeks prior to routine radical prostatectomy. We will use immunohistochemistry to quantify changes in the levels of biomarkers of PARP inhibition e.g. PAR gamma H2AX pH2A(s129) and Rad51 foci using tumour samples taken at baseline and at the time of radical prostatectomy. An intra-operative prostate biopsy will permit us to examine biomarker variability between the samples. The incidence and severity of Adverse Events will be documented and we will assess the number of trial participants who undergo surgery on schedule. We will assess preliminary evidence of tumour response e.g. pathological changes and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA). We also intend to investigate changes to the ctDNA profile by comparing blood samples collected throughout the study.    ,NCT02324998

Prostate Cancer,Effects of EPA on Prostate Cancer Cells Proliferation and Quality of Life, Prostate cancer the most frequently diagnosed cancer among occidental men is associated with a major individual and societal burden. Although still controversial the literature suggests that a high consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (?3) has protective effects against prostate cancer. One of the proposed mechanisms of action of ?3 lies in their anti-inflammatory properties. In addition there are some observational evidences suggesting an association of ?3 intake with a lower rate of depression in cancer patients. However no clinical study has tested the efficacy of ?3 supplementation on psychological and quality of life outcomes in that population. Several evidences point to a possible involvement of inflammation in psychological issues. Reducing the systemic inflammatory state may have beneficial impact on the quality of life of these patients. Preliminary work from this team of investigators in a cohort of patients managed with active surveillance for their low-grade prostate cancer show a strong inverse association between the risk of prostate cancer progression (to high-grade) and the level of prostatic eicosapentanoic acid (EPA- a type of ?3). HYPOTHESIS: EPA-rich monoglycerides fish oil (MAG-EPA) has global positive effects on prostate cancer cell proliferation inflammation and on the patient's psychosocial functioning and quality of life. The investigators propose a double blind randomized controlled clinical trial. 130 consecutive patients suffering from high-risk prostate cancer who choose to be treated by radical prostatectomy will be eligible to this study. The presence of high-grade cancer will be mandatory. The intervention a daily supplementation with 3g supplement of fish oil monoglycerides rich in EPA vs. placebo capsules containing high oleic sunflower oil will start six weeks before the prostatectomy and will continue for one year after surgery. The potential confounding variables will be measured before the start of the intervention: age anthropometric parameters stage and clinical and pathological tumor grade (Gleason score) pre-operative level of prostate specific antigen and diet. This project proposes a simple intervention by dietary supplementation that could eventually help to reduce the incidence and/or progression of prostate cancer and the consequences of its treatment and thus could contribute to diminish the heavy individual and societal burden of prostate cancer. The clinical data generated by this trial will serve as solid basis for a large-scale phase III clinical trial.    ,NCT02333435

Prostate Cancer,Enzalutamide and Metformin Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer, This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of metformin hydrochloride when given together with enzalutamide in treating patients with prostate cancer that has not responded to previous treatment with hormones. Hormone therapy using enzalutamide may fight prostate cancer by lowering the amount of androgens the body makes and blocking the use of androgens by the tumor cells. Metformin hydrochloride used for diabetes may also help kill tumor cells. Giving enzalutamide together with metformin hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.    ,NCT02339168
Prostate Cancer,Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy vs Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer, The primary goal of this phase II study is to comparing the SBRT and IMRT. The hypothesis for each arm is that the probability of the change in EPIC HRQOL scores (1-year minus baseline) is less than (or equal to) an acceptable limit. If it can be shown that either arm is tolerable in terms of patient-reported outcome (PRO) then that hypofractionated regimen will be considered for further use in a phase III study.    ,NCT02339701
Prostate Cancer,A Study of 2-hydroxyflutamide (Liproca Depot) Injected Into the Prostate in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer, The primary aim of the study was to characterize and quantify the histopathological changes in the surgical specimens obtained in patients undergoing prostatectomy in addition to imaging changes (MRI) following a single injection of Liproca Depot in patients with localized prostate cancer.    ,NCT02341404
Prostate Cancer,Single Fraction Real-time High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy in Patients With Low and Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer, High-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) is an advanced technology theorized to be more advantageous than LDR-BT and External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) to the patient himself and in terms of resource allocation. Studies of HDR-BT monotherapy have encouraging results in terms of biochemical control patient survival and toxicity but there are still certain limitations that preclude recommending HDR-BT monotherapy outside the setting of a clinical trial. The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the safety tolerance and impact on quality of life (QoL) of the BT-HDR 19Gy administered in single fraction in patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. Secondary endpoint is to measure the efficacy in terms of cancer control and satisfaction of the patients undergoing the experimental treatment. Forty nine patients will be recruited for the experimental procedure Quality of Life tolerance gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity will be assessed using standardized procedures and scales. Patient satisfaction with the procedure will be appraised using five-category predetermined Likert scale questions. Two different types of intermediate analyses will be performed: with 15 and 30 recruited patients. The experimental treatment tested in this study is very innovative. Since prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer in men in Spain this trial results are very likely to have a major impact on the standard therapy for prostate cancer in our National Health Service allowing for a higher number of Hospitals within our country and other countries starting protocols of HDR BT 19Gy in single fraction.    ,NCT02342054

Prostate Cancer,A Study Evaluating Intravenous Melphalan With Autologous Whole Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Over Three Cycles in Patients With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of intensified intravenous Melphalan in combination with a transplant of patients' own blood stem cells for a maximum of three cycles. In a recently completed small Phase I study looking at the use of higher doses of intravenous Melphalan with the combination of lenograstim (a drug that stimulates bone marrow to produce white blood cells helping to fight infection) and patients' own blood infusion over 4 cycles of treatment has proved encouraging. The results of this study showed rapid improvement in pain and a fall in circulating tumour cells within two weeks of starting Melphalan. However slow platelet recovery after the fourth cycle meant longer periods of platelet transfusion. For this trial we intend to assess the efficacy of an intensified intravenous Melphalan with transplant of patients' own blood stem cells over a shorter time period. This study will involve approximately 39 patients over a 3 year period.    ,NCT02349347

Prostate Cancer,Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) of Pelvis and Prostate Targets For High Risk Prostate Cancer, Since high risk prostate cancer requires higher radiation this study is being done to determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation to the prostate and pelvic regions. Also to determine the feasibility and safety of each treatment fraction by using cone-beam Computed Tomography(CT) information and high speed Graphics Processing Unit based computation treatment planning systems. We also plan to determine the safety of treatment to the prostate. Health-related quality of life will be measured as part of current clinical practice.   -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or to safely escalate dose to the pelvic nodal using 90 day acute toxicity endpoint   -  Determine feasibility and safety of adaptive real time re-planning of the pelvic nodal region at each treatment fraction by using cone-beam CT (CBCT) information and high speed GPU based computation treatment planning systems   -  Determine the safety and tolerability of 9.5 Gy per fraction in five fractions (47.5 Gy total dose) to the prostate   -  To follow tumor related outcomes (i.e. PSA control progression-free survival (PFS) distant metastasis (DM) free survival and overall survival (OS)   -  Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured as part of current clinical practice Patients in each dose cohort will all be treated as a single group for dose escalation. There will be two levels of dose escalation?to prostate lesions and to pelvic lymph node region. Prostate/SV PTV will be treated at a fixed dose of 9.5 Gy per fraction for 5 fractions (47.5 Gy) based on our previous phase I/II study experiences. The starting dose for the dose escalation to the pelvic region PTV will be 4.5 Gy per fraction for 5 fractions (total dose= 22.5 Gy). Subsequent cohorts of patients will receive an additional 0.5 Gy per treatment (total 2.5 Gy per escalation). The starting dose for MRI-visible prostatic lesions will be 10 Gy and subsequent cohorts will receive an additional 0.5Gy per treatment (total of 2.5Gy per escalation).    ,NCT02353819

Prostate Cancer,Metformin for Rising PSA Remote Trial," Clinical trials are critical to informing the care of patients with cancer. However only 3-5% of patients with cancer enroll in clinical trials. Poor accrual to trials has major implications with regards to the pace of progress the cost of clinical cancer research and the generalizability of results. The investigators have recently shown in an analysis of 7776 cancer clinical trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov that approximately 20% of cancer clinical trials fail to complete enrollment at all; the most often cited reason was poor accrual. Prior research has identified barriers to cancer clinical trial accrual that can be generally categorized in the domains of availability awareness and acceptance. Much attention has been paid to the barriers involvement awareness and acceptance - however trial availability is likely a ""rate limiting step"". This pilot study is the first in a series of planned steps to attempt to shift the current paradigm of ""bringing patients to trials"" to ""bringing trials to patients."" With the integration of telemedicine visits the investigators aim to decrease the burden of participation for patients begin to address geographic barriers and ultimately improve trial accrual. In this study men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (a rising PSA after definitive local therapy) will receive the antidiabetic drug metformin. Patients will require a single on-site visit for study enrollment. The remainder of the 6 month study will be conducted via a HIPPA secure telemonitoring system (monthly visits conducted via telemedicine with tablet computers provided to each patients).

Prostate Cancer,Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patient With Previous Negative Biopsies, Prostate cancer has been the most common neoplastic disease in men in Finland over the last ten years. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) plays an important role in screening of prostate cancer. However PSA has a limited sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection. Commonly the diagnosis of prostate cancer is done by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guided biopsy. Because of the low accuracy of TRUS a systematic biopsy is usually performed instead of targeted TRUS biopsy. While as many as 47% of the ultra-sound guided biopsies may be false negative and biopsies carry a risk of increase in complications there is an increasing interest in developing more accurate non-invasive imaging modalities. This study will enroll 150 men with previous negative biopsies and clinical suspicion of prostate cancer due to serum level of PSA higher than 2.5 ng/ml or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) or patients in active surveillance due to low risk prostate carcinoma. Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) at 3 Tesla (T) magnetic field using surface coils will be used to non-invasively predict the presence or absence of prostate cancer. In addition to routine 12-core TRUS biopsies targeted TRUS guided biopsy based on MRI findings will be performed.    ,NCT02388126
Prostate Cancer,Evaluation of Clarity Ultrasound Guidance for Prostate Therapy, Radiotherapy (RT) is an important treatment for prostate cancer with over 10000 men receiving RT per year in the UK. Prostate RT aims to deliver radiation dose to the prostate to kill cancer cells whilst minimizing the dose given to surrounding normal tissues such as the bladder or the rectum. Radiation is delivered in a number of daily treatments which are called 'fractions'. The position of the prostate varies each day and during the radiation delivery. To accurately aim the radiation the prostate needs to be located before daily treatment. Clarity is an ultrasound image guidance system that locates the prostate and monitors its position during treatment. Ultrasound does not give a radiation dose is non-invasive provides fast imaging and can easily visualise soft tissues. Before Clarity is implemented the investigators wish to ensure that it can accurately locate and monitor the prostate by comparing Clarity with marker-based techniques in 24 patients. Patients receive markers as part of other trials which are currently recruiting at The Royal Marsden (for example patients in the DELINEATE trial and the PACE trials receive implanted gold markers and patients in the PROSPARE trial have received electromagnetic markers). Patients who have received or will be receiving markers as part of other studies will be asked to also to take part in this study. This means that there will be no additional intervention for patients as a result of this study. Clarity will be considered a safe and effective imaging system if the mean and standard deviation of the differences between Clarity measurements and marker measurements of prostate position are less than 1mm. It is possible that markers will influence the Clarity measurements. To find out if this happens the mean and standard deviation of Clarity measurements in a group of 24 patients without markers to the group with markers will be compared. Primary Aim: To evaluate the accuracy of Clarity ultrasound image guidance system for prostate motion estimation during treatment (intra-fraction) by comparison with implanted marker-based image guidance techniques. Primary Hypothesis: Clarity can be safely used to deliver radiotherapy using similar (within 1mm) treatment margins to those that would be employed if fiducial markers based image guidance techniques were used.    ,NCT02388308
Prostate Cancer,VAccination in Prostate caNCEr (VANCE)," This is a clinical trial of a new treatment for prostate cancer that is a type of vaccine that could be a new way to treat cancer. A vaccine that could alert the immune system to the presence of cancer cells in the body may enable the immune system to target and kill those cells effectively. This vaccine is intended to work by making the immune system kill cells that have a special protein (called 5T4) that is present on the surface of cancer cells. The vaccine is made up of two recombinant viruses (""ChAdOx1"" and ""MVA"") that have been designed to produce the 5T4 protein and have been modified so that they are weakened and cannot reproduce themselves within the body like normal viruses. Once injected into the body these viruses make the 5T4 protein and help the body's immune system to learn to target this protein and destroy cancer cells. This is a first-in-human study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1.5T4-MVA.5T4 vaccination regime. It is evaluated in neo-adjuvant setting in low and intermediate risk localised prostate cancer patients who have either decided to have their prostate removed or are stable on active surveillance.

Prostate Cancer,Utilizing MRI to Study the Effect of Sulforaphane on Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is a major public health problem and there is a strong need of new preventive strategies based on drug and lifestyle interventions. It is now well-established that healthy eating patterns and increasing physical activity can prevent or delay prostate cancer progression. Intake of cruciferous vegetables (e.g. broccoli cabbage cauliflower Brussels sprouts kale) has been associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer progression; however the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. The investigators propose to undertake a pilot study on a group of men with early prostate cancer on active surveillance to determine whether a diet rich in broccoli will induce changes in tumor size and blood flow measured by conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques. Men with early prostate cancer on active surveillance who have visible cancer lesions on MRI will be recruited onto this double-blinded randomized intervention and they will be asked to eat one portion of broccoli soup per week for 6 months. The investigators will test two varieties of broccoli (standard and 'Beneforte extra' broccoli) that are able to deliver two different levels of sulforaphane (SF) an active compound extensively studied for its potential anticancer properties. This study will involve MRI scans blood and urine collection before and after a 6 month intervention period. This study design will not only allow us to observe diet-induced changes within the prostate but also at the systemic level. In addition participant's lifestyle (habitual diet and physical activity) will be assessed by food diaries and exercise questionnaires. This study has been funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and Prostate Cancer foundation (PCF).    ,NCT02404428

Prostate Cancer,Relationship of Mitochondrial Enzymes With Cancer Related Fatigue, Project Study: Pilot Human Study Specific Aims: 1. describe levels of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes 2. examine relationships between levels of mitochondrial enzymes fatigue and health-related quality of life; and 3. compare levels of mitochondrial enzymes in men with a clinically-significant change in fatigue from those with no change in fatigue. Significance of Study: Cancer related fatigue is a common side effect of cancer. Cancer related fatigue is poorly understood. Many different biological mechanisms have been theorized including mitochondrial dysfunction. Self-reported descriptions of reduced energy and muscle weakness lend support for a possible relationship of cancer related fatigue to mitochondrial dysfunction. Main Research Variables: Mitochondrial Enzymes Cancer related fatigue and health related quality of life Design: Descriptive longitudinal study Sample/Setting: Men with non-metastatic prostate-cancer who are scheduled to receive radiation therapy Methods: Questionnaires mouth swabs and blood will be collected at four study visits: prior to treatment midpoint of treatment completion of treatment and within 90 days of finishing treatment. Four mouth swabs will be collected per participant at each study visit. Implications for Practice: Understanding the role of mitochondrial enzymes in cancer related fatigue has major clinical implications in the development of targeted interventions and in providing specific knowledge for patients and their families to make informed treatment decisions.    ,NCT02414971

Prostate Cancer,Using Multiparametric MRI to Evaluate Intraprostatic Tumor Responses and Androgen Resistance Patterns in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  There are several ways to treat prostate cancer. Researchers want to see how well a certain kind of imaging helps detect prostate cancer. They also want to see if a particular drug combination used before surgery will benefit people with prostate cancer that hasn t spread in the body (non-metastatic). The combination will be androgen deprivation therapy and enzalutamide.   -  The combination of androgen deprivation therapy and enzalutamide has been shown to make patients with advanced (metastatic disease) live longer. The investigators want to see if using it earlier can increase cure rate of surgery and identify genetic or molecular characteristics that are associated with better outcomes. Objectives: - To develop better ways of detecting prostate cancer before and after pre-operative treatment. Eligibility: - Men at least 18 years old with non-metastatic prostate cancer. They must be candidates for a radical prostatectomy. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with medical history physical exam and blood tests. They will have scans and X-rays.   -  Before starting the study drugs participants will have:   -  Vital signs taken medical history and blood tests.   -  ECG heart test with patches stuck on the skin.   -  Small piece of tumor removed (biopsy) using image guidance from MRI and ultrasound.   -  3T mpMRI. Participants will lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder. A probe will be inserted in the <TAB>rectum. They will be in the scanner for about 60 minutes lying still. The scanner makes loud knocking <TAB>sounds. Participants will get earplugs.   -  Participants will take the 2 study drugs for 6 months.   -  Enzalutamide is taken as 4 pills once a day.   -  Androgen deprivation therapy is given by injection 2 times over 6 months.   -  During these 6 months participants will visit the clinic monthly. They will have physical exam vital signs and blood drawn.   -  After finishing the study drugs participants will have another 3T mpMRI. Then they will have prostate removal surgery.    ,NCT02430480

Prostate Cancer,Radiologically Guided Biopsies of mCRPC, The purpose of this study is to better understand how cancer treatment may affect cancer cells. The research will involve genetic molecular cellular and immunologic experiments using blood and tumor specimens. It is hoped that the information gained from these studies will lead to a greater understanding of castrate-resistant prostate cancer and potentially improvements in cancer treatment. This is a tissue collection protocol requiring image-guided biopsies of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The investigators will focus on enrolling patients with metastatic CRPC who have progressed while receiving novel AR-targeted therapeutics such as abiraterone and enzalutamide. This population of patients was selected because resistance develops relatively rapidly following potent inhibitors of AR activity and the mechanisms of resistance have to be better understood. Without comprehensive analysis of mCRPC tumor the investigators will never gain a full understanding of the biology driving resistance in human disease and developing rational co-targeting approaches will not be possible.    ,NCT02432001

Prostate Cancer,Exercise Prostate Cancer and Circulating Tumour Cells," Obesity known to be associated with a pro-inflammatory pro-thrombotic humoral milieu confers a worse prognosis in prostate cancer (PrCa). Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are identified in the blood in advanced cancer. Their quantitation provides prognostic information. ""Cloaking"" of CTCs by adherent platelets impedes natural killer (NK)-cell clearance of CTCs from the circulation enhancing metastatic spread. NK-cell function in blood and in solid organs is quantitatively and qualitatively reduced in obesity. Platelet cloaking may be enhanced in obesity due to the pro-inflammatory pro-thrombotic state and may be a mechanism for worse cancer-specific outcomes in this group. Obesity and its biochemical effects may be influenced by lifestyle changes such as exercise. Physical activity reduces levels of systemic inflammatory mediators and so an aerobic exercise intervention may represent an accessible and cost-effective means of ameliorating the pro-inflammatory effects of obesity. The ExPeCT trial will determine if a prescribed exercise intervention can ameliorate the degree of platelet cloaking in obese and non-obese men with advanced prostate cancer.    ",NCT02453139

Prostate Cancer,Assessment of Prostate MRI Before Prostate Biopsies," Background: Prostate cancer is difficult to detect using ultrasound. As a result in case of suspicion of prostate cancer based on digital rectal examination (DRE) or Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level it is currently recommended to perform ""blinded"" systematically distributed biopsies with 10-18 samples obtained from predefined locations in the gland. These so-called systematic biopsies (SB) may lead to improper patient management by (i) missing clinically significant cancer especially in the anterior half of the gland that tends to be undersampled (ii) inducing chance detection of clinically insignificant cancer foci that may result in overtreatments (iii) undersampling the tumor foci and thus underestimating their volume and aggressiveness. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mp-MRI) has yielded promising results in detecting aggressive (Gleason ??) prostate cancers. Several monocenter studies showed that targeted biopsies (TB) based on mp-MRI findings could detect significantly more aggressive cancers reduce the diagnosis of clinically insignificant cancers and better evaluate the aggressiveness of detected cancers than SB. However these monocenter studies only provide low-level evidence and three recent independent reviews of literature concluded that there was a need for a robust multicenter trial evaluating the diagnostic yield of TB as compared to SB. This is particularly important since many academic and private centers in France already perform mp-MRI before prostate biopsy in daily routine. Therefore the risk is that this approach becomes the norm without being properly evaluated and it is crucial and urgent to perform a controlled multicentric study to provide high-level evidence as to whether mp-MRI should or should not be obtained before prostate biopsy. One controlled multicentric study has been published recently in which SB and TB had been obtained by two different operators in 95 patients. TB yielded a significantly higher detection rate for all prostate cancers (69% vs 59% p=0.033) and for clinically significant cancers (67% vs 52% p=0.0011). However this study was limited by the fact that patients with negative mp-MRI were not included. Research hypotheses: There is currently no robust multicenter trial comparing prostate TB based on mp-MRI findings versus the current standard of care (SB). We propose a multicentre prospective trial comparing the results of SB and TB performed in the same patients by two independent operators. Our hypothesis is that TB detect aggressive (Gleason ??) cancers in a significantly higher percentage of patients than SB. Main objective: Compare the percentage of patients with ""clinically significant cancer"" (using definition A i.e. cancer with Gleason score ??) detected by SB versus TB.    ",NCT02485379

Prostate Cancer,Hormonal Therapy and Chemotherapy Followed by Prostatectomy in Patients With Prostate Cancer, This is a study for men who have locally-advanced prostate cancer and are eligible to undergo prostatectomy. Standard treatment is prostatectomy alone but there is a chance that cancer may spread to other organs in the future even after the prostate is removed. If this were to occur standard treatment would be androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; hormone therapy that blocks testosterone) plus chemotherapy. Clinical trials suggest that neoadjuvant treatment (treatment given before primary therapy) may prevent a recurrence. The purpose of this research study is to assess the safety and benefit of ADT plus chemotherapy given before prostate removal.    ,NCT02494713
Prostate Cancer,LEE011 (Ribociclib) in Combination With Docetaxel Plus Prednisone in mCRPC, This is a Phase Ib/II open label clinical trial in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. The objective of the phase Ib portion of the study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV q21 days) and prednisone (5mg orally BID) in combination with ribociclib in escalating oral daily doses in patients with metastatic CRPC with prior resistance to abiraterone and/or enzalutamide who have not undergone prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Up to three cohorts will be enrolled to determine the MTD and DLT profile of this combination during Phase 1b. Dose escalation will follow the standard 3+3 design. The dosing schedule is being chosen to allow patients to be exposed to the most efficacious dosing schedule of docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). If there is excess toxicity observed with the treatment combination at the first dose level (dose level I) an alternative dosing schema may be pursued with weekly docetaxel treatment (35 mg/m2 weekly) which has demonstrated activity in mCRPC and decreased risk of cytopenias compared with every 3 week dosing schedule. The Phase II portion (N = 29) of the study is a single arm two stage open-label study of ribociclib (dosed at the RP2D) in combination with docetaxel and prednisone to determine the efficacy and further define the safety of the treatment combination. Patients will be treated with the combination of ribociclib plus docetaxel + prednisone for up to 9 cycles. If there is no evidence of radiographic or clinical disease progression after 9 cycles of protocol therapy patients may continue on single agent maintenance ribociclib until the time of disease progression. Patients will have the option of starting maintenance ribociclib after 6 cycles of docetaxel if stable disease or better on re-staging scans. The dose of ribociclib used during maintenance will be the same dose as that immediately preceding cessation of docetaxel treatment.    ,NCT02494921

Prostate Cancer,Cellular Effect of Cholesterol-Lowering Prior to Prostate Removal, There is evidence in human studies as well as animal studies that treatments to lower cholesterol can reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer.To decide if cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the growth of prostate cancer the investigators would like to lower cholesterol prior to surgery and then measure the growth of prostate cancers cells when the prostate has been removed. The investigators will use the combination of two drugs that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to lower cholesterol. The drug combination is commercially available with a doctor's prescription and sold as Vytorin®. It is known that maximal cholesterol-lower effects are seen after 2 weeks of treatment with Vytorin®. Therefore study patients receive at least 2 weeks but no more than 6 weeks of Vytorin® prior to surgery.    ,NCT02534376
Prostate Cancer,Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Heart-rate Corrected QT(QTc) Interval Prolongation During Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy -Randomized Blind Clinical Trial-, Sympathetic activity could be increased during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy which is performed in a steep trendelenburg position under CO2 pneumoperitoneum. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system prolongs the QT interval and can increases the susceptibility to life threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Dexmedetomidine has sympatholytic effects and potential antiarrhythmic properties. Perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine is a potential preventive and treatment strategy for tachyarrhythmia. Thus the investigators decided to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on heart-rate corrected QT interval during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.

Prostate Cancer,The PROFILE Study: Germline Genetic Profiling: Correlation With Targeted Prostate Cancer Screening and Treatment, Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United Kingdom (UK) with over 40000 men diagnosed each year. Prostate cancer (PrCa) can run in some families and research studies have identified several genetic changes that are thought to increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. This study aims to look at the potential risk of these changes in targeted screening. Some of these changes may cause a very slight increase in prostate cancer risk while others may cause a much larger increase in risk of developing prostate cancer. The investigators will invite men with a family history of prostate cancer for targeted prostate screening (Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) testing and a biopsy of the prostate gland) and genetic profiling. This research will help us to determine what the risk of cancer is for men who have inherited these genetic changes and also increase our knowledge about the role of genetics in developing prostate cancer targeted screening. Some of these changes may cause a very slight increase in prostate cancer risk while others may cause a much larger increase in risk of developing prostate cancer.

Prostate Cancer,Hypofractionated Whole Pelvic Radiotherapy of the Prostate, This is a phase I feasibility study to evaluate the feasibility of hypofractionated whole pelvis radiotherapy in 35 patients with biopsy-proven intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer as defined by NCCN risk criteria. Patients will have >15% risk of lymph node involvement as defined by the Roach equation 2/3(PSA)+10(Gleason Score-6). Day 0 of the study will be defined as the time of first LHRH/agonist/antagonist injection of hormone therapy. Radiation therapy should begin within 8 weeks (+/- 1 week) after the date of the first LHRH agonist/antagonist injection. Patients will be followed at 6 weeks and then every 3 months for the first 24 months after completion of radiotherapy in a similar schedule to usual standard of care. A history and physical PSA testosterone and EPIC-26 questionnaire will be collected at each visit. Any toxicity according to CTCAE v. 4.0 criteria will be documented. An interim analysis for evaluating acute toxicity (??0 days) will be performed after the first follow-up visit of the20th patient enrolled on protocol. The trial will be terminated if >30% acute grade 2 or >5% grade 3 or greater toxicity is observed as a result of radiation treatment by CTCAE v. 4.0 criteria. Grade 2 toxicity is defined as a minimal local or noninvasive intervention. Grade 3 toxicity is defined as a severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening event requiring hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization. Previous studies have demonstrated approximately 30% and 5% incidence of Grade 2 and Grade 3 or greater toxicity respectively with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy followed by brachytherapy.    ,NCT02546427

Prostate Cancer,Phase II Study of Ultra-high-dose Hypofractionated vs. Single-dose Image-Guided Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer, The present study evaluates clinical outcomes and treatment-related toxicity following definitive ultra-high dose external beam radiotherapy delivered with two different regimens in patients with intermediate-risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Modern computer-driven technology enables the implementation of ultra-high hypofractionated Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) safely. Prostate cancer patients classified according to the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as intermediate risk (biopsy Gleason score of 7 and/or Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level >10 and ??0 ng/mL and/or Stage T1 T2a T2b or T2c) are eligible for this study. Patients will undergo IGRT with volumetric intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) with state-of-the-art treatment-planning and quality assurance procedures. Emphasis is placed on normal tissue sparing and delivery accuracy via the use of devices that ensure stability and beam location reproducibility. A rectal balloon with air filling will be used for prostate target immobilization and anatomical reproducibility while a urethral catheter loaded with beacon transponders will be used to ensure set-up reproducibility and online target tracking. Previously untreated patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer will be prospectively randomized to receive either 45 Gy in five fractions of 9 Gy each vs. 24 Gy in a single-dose. Patients will be followed at one month post-treatment and every 3 months for up to 12 months (+/- 4 weeks) and every 6 months thereafter. Acute and chronic toxicity evaluations will focus on urinary rectal and sexual functions and will be assessed through validated questionnaires. Serum PSA values will be regularly acquired during follow-up. A multiparametric MRI will be performed at baseline 6 12 and 24 months following intervention. Additionally a post-treatment diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) will be performed within 15 minutes of the first treatment to measure early physiologic changes such as perfusion and ischemia that may correlate with clinically relevant end-points. Post-treatment prostate needle biopsies will be obtained at 24 months to evaluate pathologic response to therapy. The study will be continuously monitored for a minimum of 5 years. In the event unexpected severe (grade ??) toxicities are observed in any one of the treatment arms the study will be terminated according to the stopping rule >3/first 15 patients.    ,NCT02570919

Prostate Cancer,Can Significant Prostate Cancer Be Detected With a Biparametric MRI?, Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most common male cancer in Denmark and the number is increasing. Annually about 1600 men are referred to the Department of Urology Herlev Gentofte Hospital due to elevated PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) or clinical symptoms suspicious of PCa. In approximately 50% of these patients PCa is diagnosed based on histopathological findings in tissue obtained from transrectal ultrasound biopsy (TRUS-bx). The TRUS-bx is taken from 10 standard zones in the prostate. If PCa lesions are visualized on TRUS they should appear hypo-echoic compared to the normal peripheral zone. But more than 40-50% of the cancerous lesions are iso-echoic and thus difficult to identify. Furthermore benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) in the transitional zone makes it difficult to locate tumours. Therefore there is a risk of missing a significant cancer or an incorrect grading of the tumors aggressiveness (Gleason score) by TRUS-bx. Thus 10 systematic biopsies are not always representative of the whole gland. In addition many men only harbour small in-significant cancer foci that will never cause patient morbidity or mortality. It is often best not to detect these small insignificant tumour foci due to the risk of overtreatment. If MRI was performed before any decision to biopsy was made some patients might not be diagnosed with insignificant PCa since MRI mainly finds significant cancers. The Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mp-MRI) seems to be more accurate in detection and localization of PCa according to clinical studies and several studies have shown that mp-MRI is able to distinguish between patients with significant and insignificant PCa. As mp-MRI visualizes the whole gland it can identify suspicious cancerous regions and be used as a guide for targeted biopsies. Also this has the potential to decrease the number of biopsies as the 10 standard biopsies can be replaced by 1-4 MRI targeted biopsies. Furthermore some patients might not need biopsies at all if the MRI does not show any suspect foci thereby decreasing the risk of complications from the biopsy-procedure. In theory mp-MRI could be used to determine which patients need to be biopsied and which do not - a sort of screening tool. The current standard examination takes about 45-60 minutes. This is too long and too costly for a screening procedure. Based on the investigators three year long experience they have chosen two scanning sequences and one calculated sequence which they believe can answer the question: Is significant cancer present or not? This is the biparametric-MRI (bp-MRI) which takes only 20-25 minutes and does not involve administrating any MRI standard drugs. The chosen sequences are: T2-weighted (T2W) images in the axial plane diffusion weighted (DWI) axial images with multiple b-values and calculation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-map. If on the other hand if MRI is to be used for staging purpose six sequences are needed: T2W images in 3 planes (axial coronal and sagittal) DWI axial images with multiple b-values plus calculation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-map and Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DCE) T1-weighted (T1W). This is called a multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI). The two T2W sequences in the coronal and sagittal planes can be left out because they mainly add information for staging purposes. The hypothesis is that these two are not necessary as the investigators only want to determine whether there is sign of significant cancer or not. Neither is the DCE using contrast medium necessary because it only indicates whether post-biopsy-blood is present or not which is not the case in this patient group. The bp-MRI will be less detailed but most details are not important when using MRI for PCa detection only. Studies show that the ADC-map calculated from DWI correlates with the Gleason score and may be used as a non-invasive measure for cancer aggressiveness. In summary the bp-MRI is designed only to determine whether significant cancer is present or not and will not be able to assess the stage of the cancer (extension through the capsule or invasion into the vesiculae seminalis or urethra/bladder neck). As previously stated half of the patients that are referred due to suspicion of PCa do not have PCa and there is no need for them to undergo the normal mp-MRI scan. In case of a high-risk patient (>cT2b Gleason score >7 and PSA >20 (group 2)) staging is necessary and because of that a normal mp-MRI will be performed.    ,NCT02584179
Prostate Cancer,Japanese Research for Patients With Non-metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer - Enzalutamide, The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in patients with non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. The total duration of the study will be 5 years. All patients will receive enzalutamide 160 mg (four 40 mg capsules) orally once daily. The treatment will be started at Visit 0 within one week after enrollment. Visit 1 is at 2 weeks after the treatment started; clinical assessments are conducted on adverse events and the Japanese version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) scales. Patients who are considered to be adequate by the investigator can continue the treatment with 12-week cycle visit (counted from initial dose) until patients meet withdrawal criteria. Patients will be followed up at 2 and 3 years after enrollment and at 3 years after the last participant enrollment. The end of the study is defined as follow-up assessment date at 3 years after the last participant enrollment. Patients will primarily be assessed by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS).    ,NCT02588001

Prostate Cancer,Androgen Suppression With Stereotactic Body or External Beam Radiation Therapy (ASSERT), Two radiation therapy techniques are commonly used for the treatment of intermediate and high risk prostate cancer: brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). However both have limitations. Brachytherapy in which radioactive seeds are inserted into the prostate produces excellent outcomes but is invasive and not all patients are eligible or willing to receive this treatment. EBRT while gentle at the time of delivery tends to be very prolonged and may have poorer outcomes than brachytherapy. This study will examine the use of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in which patients are given only a few high dose radiation treatments. Treatments are short non-invasive applicable to patients not able to do brachytherapy and may be more effective than conventional EBRT. This study will compare SABR with EBRT in terms of the rates of acute and late toxicities for each treatment disease-free survival and health-related quality of life measures.    ,NCT02594072
Prostate Cancer,Care of the Prostate Cancer Patient and Prospective Procurement of Prostate Cancer Tissue, Background: Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer among men in the U.S. Researchers want to study blood tissue and fluid samples of people with prostate cancer. This will help them understand any changes in cells and genes. These changes might lead to the development and progression of prostate cancer. Researchers think the study could lead to new treatments. Objective: To understand the changes in cells and genes that lead to the development and progression of prostate cancer. This could lead to new treatments. Eligibility: Men ages 18 and older who have or are suspected to have prostate cancer Design: Participants will be screened with physical exam and medical history. Participants will send tissue blocks of their tumor if possible. If not they will provide unstained slides of tumor tissue. Participants may provide samples of blood urine saliva and prostate secretions. Participants may have imaging tests. They will lie in a machine that takes pictures of their body. These tests include: MRI of the prostate CT of the abdomen and pelvis Chest x-ray Participants may need a biopsy or surgery for treatment of their cancer. If so researchers will collect tissue. Participants may answer questions about their prostate cancer and quality of life. Participants may have follow-up visits or other treatments. They may have follow-up phone calls every few months.    ,NCT02594202

Prostate Cancer,Creation of an Image Database for the Development of a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) System in Patients With Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is currently detected by ultrasound-guided biopsy. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems based on multiparametric MRI are now capable of detecting most aggressive cancer foci non-invasively but additional progress is needed for the technique to be accepted in clinical practice. We hypothesize that combining MRI and ultrasound imaging can improve the detection of cancerous tumors. As a first step in this direction we need to create a database with MR images 3D ultrasound images and corresponding histopathology results in patients treated by radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. This is the purpose of the present study. In a later stage (outside the scope of this study) we will be learning how to combine these images to best recognize cancerous tumors we will use that knowledge to develop a new CAD system and we will assess the performance of the new CAD. We expect this future system to improve the detection of prostate cancer and to reduce the number of patients requiring biopsy.    ,NCT02618200
Prostate Cancer,Impact of Yoga As Complementary Therapy in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy, The researchers hope to learn if yoga complementary therapy would improve health-related quality of life recovery of urinary continence and erectile function in patients who underwent prostate cancer surgery (i.e. radical prostatectomy). We hypothesized that in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy preoperative and postoperative Yoga complementary therapy would improve health- related quality of life (HRQOL) recovery of urinary continence and erectile function. This two-arm randomized controlled pilot study will compare Yoga intervention to usual care group. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of Yoga complementary therapy on HRQOL in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). Yoga therapy will be given to the intervention group three times in a week for 6 weeks prior to surgery and then initiated 3 weeks after the surgery for another 6 weeks. The yoga exercise will be tailored to the participant's comfort level. As an exploratory analysis we will evaluate pro-inflammatory and immunological markers.    ,NCT02620033

Prostate Cancer,MRI Assisted Focal Boost With HDR Monotherapy for Prostate Cancer Patients, Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of prostate cancer. In recent years it has become evident that higher doses of radiation are required to optimize disease control. The limiting factor of escalating dose to the prostate is the surrounding normal tissue. Despite advances in escalating radiation therapy failures still occur in 20-30% of patients most often at the site of the original primary disease. As such there is growing interest in further dose escalating to the area of primary disease burden.The aim of this work is to look at the feasibility and toxicities of an integrated focal boost to whole gland prostate treatment using high dose rate brachytherapy.    ,NCT02623933
Prostate Cancer,HDR Brachytherapy vs. LDR Brachytherapy Monotherapy in Localized Prostate Cancer, High-dose rate brachytherapy (HDRB) used as monotherapy is emerging as an alternative to Low-Dose Rate brachytherapy (LDRB) with excellent PSA-progression free survival as high as 90-100% for favorable prostate cancer at a median follow-up of 3-5 years. HDRB has many advantages over LDRB such as prospective dosimetry not impacted by setup errors organ motion and prostate swelling during treatment delivery. In addition HDRB causes less acute and late urinary toxicity compared with LDRB. Acute urinary retention can lead to prolonged catheterization pericatheter urine leakage urinary tract infection and Trans-Urethral Resection of the Prostate resulting in diminished quality of life (QOL) and increased psychological distress. The goal of the investigators' phase II randomized study is to evaluate the differences in QOL in the urinary domain between patients with favourable intermediate risk or extensive low-risk prostate cancer treated with LDRB and HDRB at 3 months using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) QOL scores. The 3 months cut-off endpoint has been chosen since HDRB-induced urinary toxicity subsides at 12 weeks compared to 12 months with LDRB. Secondary objectives include: bowel and sexual domain EPIC scores and International Prostate Symptom Score. The absolute PSA nadir and a prostate biopsy at 36 months will be reported to assess local control.    ,NCT02628041
Prostate Cancer,Perception of Cohesion Within a Relationship (Dyadic Adjustment) on the Quality of Life of Patients With Prostate Cancer With Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone., The general hypothesis put forward in this study is that the degree of cohesion (agreement) in the relationship or dyadic adjustment affects a patient's quality of life and clinical course during the first few critical months following diagnosis and the introduction of treatment. The level of cohesion in the relationship is certainly not the only parameter associated with changes in the quality of life. Other factors must also be investigated such as level of education circumstances surrounding the diagnosis (new diagnosis or relapse) management (single therapy or adjuvant therapy) the level of physical activity the patient's age and the presence of functional disorders etc.    ,NCT02630641
Prostate Cancer,Hypofractionated Radiosurgery for Localised Prostate Cancer," Hypofractionated radiosurgery has been investigated in a few trials and appears to be safe and feasible. Investigators initiated this multicenter phase II prospective trial to analyse feasibility (toxicity) of hypofractionated radiosurgery with 5 fractions in patients with localised prostate cancer who are ineligible for the ""PREFERE trial"" under the hypothesis that the ratio of patients with late toxicity ??grade 2 after 1 year amounts 28% and is significant lower than 17.5%.    ",NCT02635256
Prostate Cancer,A Bio-psychosocial Sexual Health Intervention for Prostate Cancer Survivors and Partners: a Feasibility Study, The burden of sexual dysfunction after prostate cancer surgery is responsible for the single greatest impact on patient/partner health-related quality of life; substantially more so than concern for cancer recurrence or any other post-surgery side-effect. Consequently there is a great need for progressive and distributable sexual health rehabilitation interventions designed to uphold intimacy and optimal sexual health. If the biomedical-psychosocial intervention is ultimately found beneficial it will result in: 1) an empirically-based intervention that helps patients/partners maintain optimal health-related quality of life after prostate cancer surgery and 2) a highly structured protocol and manualized intervention that is translatable to other treatment groups (e.g. radiation therapy) and University/Community-based hospitals.    ,NCT02640131
Prostate Cancer,Hemiablative Focal Brachytherapy Pilot Study, Whole gland LDR brachytherapy has been a well established modality of treating low risk prostate cancer.

Prostate Cancer,Prostvac in Patients With Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer, Background: Some people who have been treated for prostate cancer still have high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. This may indicate cancer. These people have non-metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) or biochemical recurrent prostate cancer. Researchers think the immune system can be taught to fight and kill cancer cells. They think an immunotherapy vaccine called prostvac could help reduce PSA levels in people with this type of prostate cancer. Objective: To test if prostvac can decrease tumor growth rate as measured by PSA compared to getting surveillance alone. Eligibility: Men ages 18 or older who have nmCSPC or biochemical recurrent prostate cancer Design: Participants will be screened with: Medical history Physical exam Blood and urine tests Bone scan CT scan or MRI and PET scan: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. Electrocardiogram: Soft electrodes are stuck to the skin to record heart signals. Participants will be part of 1 of 2 arms: Arm A will get prostvac for 6 months. Arm B will have surveillance for 6 months followed by prostvac for 6 months. During the prostvac period participants will get prostvac as a shot under the skin on weeks 1 3 and 5 and then monthly for a total of 5 months. Participants will have follow-up visits at least every month until they recover from prostvac side effects or their cancer worsens. Visits may include repeats of screening tests. Participants will be followed for up to 15 years. They will have a physical exam every year for the first 5 years. They will have phone calls once a year.    ,NCT02649439
Prostate Cancer,Docetaxel and PROSTVAC for Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer, Background: Metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer is cancer that has spread beyond the prostate area. It can be controlled by lowering the amount of testosterone in the body. This is called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The vaccine PROSTVAC might help the immune system kill cancer cells. Researchers want to add PROSTVAC and docetaxel chemotherapy to ADT. They think this may work better against prostate cancer than ADT alone. Objective: To test if adding PROSTVAC and docetaxel to ADT works better against prostate cancer than ADT alone. Eligibility: Men ages 18 years and over with metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer Design: Participants will be screened with: Physical exam Medical history Blood tests Possible CT MRI or bone scan: Participants lie in a machine. The machine takes pictures of the body. Electrocardiogram: Soft electrodes are stuck to the skin to record heart signals. Participants will have 2 optional tumor biopsies during the study. Participants will join 1 of 2 groups. Both groups will get: ADT Docetaxel by vein Steroids by mouth or vein before each docetaxel infusion PROSTVAC injection Both groups first have ADT. One to 4 months after they have: Group A: Docetaxel every 3 weeks for 6 cycles PROSTVAC 3 weeks after the last infusion Booster injections 2 weeks later and then every 3 weeks for 6 boosters total Group B: PROSTVAC Booster 2 weeks later Docetaxel hours later Docetaxel and the booster every 3 weeks for 6 cycles Participants will have a visit 4-5 weeks after the last treatment. They will then have visits every 12 weeks. Participants will be followed for up to 15 years. This includes physical exams every year for 5 years.    ,NCT02649855

Prostate Cancer,Validation Study on the Impact of Decipher® Testing - VANDAAM Study, The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether a tumor test recently developed by GenomeDx Biosciences known as Decipher® can predict aggressive prostate cancer with the same accuracy in African-American men (AAM) as in non-African-American men (NAAM). The Decipher® test was developed from samples derived mainly from men of European origins and little is known about its performance in AAM. It is important to study whether this test can be used in AAM who are known to experience the highest rates of prostate cancer as well as death from prostate cancer. The use of the Decipher® test result to predict how well a patient will do before treatment may make it possible for doctors to distinguish aggressive disease from low risk prostate cancer and modify treatment accordingly. Thus patients that do not need additional therapies may be spared from unnecessary side effects and those that are at risk may be provided with more aggressive therapy to improve survival. This study is being done to learn whether the Decipher test can really affect these outcomes.    ,NCT02723734

Prostate Cancer,Androgen Deprivation Therapy or Androgen Deprivation Therapy Plus Definitive Treatment (Radiation or Surgery), The goal of this clinical research is to learn if treatment with androgen deprivation therapy in combination with surgery or radiation therapy can prolong the progression-free survival of oligometastatic prostate cancer than androgen deprivation therapy alone. The safety of this treatment combination will also be studied.    ,NCT02742675
Prostate Cancer,Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Men With Suspected Prostate Cancer, The clinical trial aims to address the critical challenge of differentiating aggressive from indolent prostate cancers by correlating prospectively collected MultiParametric (MP) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data (index test) with the histopathology of radical prostatectomy specimens (reference standard). The study design incorporates pre-biopsy MRI routine standard of care Transrectal Ultrasound guided (TRUS) biopsies and MRI/Ultrasound (US) image fusion techniques to guide biopsies to the suspicious areas identified by MRI. The hypothesis is that MP-MRI will allow pre-treatment determination of prostate cancer aggressiveness and MRI/US image fusion is expected to accurately co-locate cancer foci within the prostate gland for guiding biopsies. Pre-treatment prediction of Gleason grade as a marker of cancer aggressiveness will better inform clinicians and patients to improve risk stratification and facilitate decision making on subsequent treatment. Image fusion will allow accurate targeting of the most suspicious areas on MP-MRI for biopsy which could obviate the need for multiple biopsies.    ,NCT02745496
Prostate Cancer,Evaluating the Impact of Prostate Only Versus Pelvic Radiation for N+ Prostate Cancer., At least 40% of the patients with prostate cancer (PC) present with positive lymph nodes (N1). The optimal treatment strategy for these patients remains controversial. Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is still often initiated as only treatment the results are disappointing. Recent studies support the use of more aggressive therapies including external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and ADT. The retrospective studies supporting the additional use of EBRT in N1 PC patients are however not conclusive regarding to the extent of radiation field. Even after an EPLND there might be a role for pelvic EBRT in irradicating microscopic disease. However pelvic irradiation irrevocably results in increased toxicity. Moreover in node negative (N0) PC patients the addition of pelvic EBRT has not resulted in improved outcome in randomised trials. However in the setting of Tumor Node Metastasis pathological stage (p)N1 proven on pathological examination PC patients this has never been evaluated so far. This trial aims to answer the question whether or not pelvic EBRT is beneficial in pathological N1 PC patients. It is also important to realise that not all pathological N1 PC patients have similar outcome. There is a significant impact of number of positive lymph nodes on outcome with two positive nodes being suggested as a significant cut-off value in predicting survival in pathological N1 PC patients. By stratifying the patients according to the number of lymph nodes involved this study will add to the proper selection of those patients who will benefit most of pelvic EBRT and avoid toxicity in patients who have no benefit of pelvic EBRT. Additionally small RNAs constitute potentially valuable markers for the diagnosis prognosis and therapeutic choices in PC patients. Blood samples will be collected to examine the potential role of miRNAs as a biomarker and to develop a prognostic signature for clinical relapse-free survival. The results of this trial will serve as a base for developping new trials in order to optimise the treatment of patients with pathological N1 PC.    ,NCT02745587

Prostate Cancer,Efficiency Study of Aspirin to Prevent the Occurrence of Prostate Cancer, Though the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PCa) is still obscure it has been reported by investigators previous studies and some other researches that PCa is often combined with tissue inflammation which is closely related to prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. Inflammation could play an important role in the process of occurrence and development of PCa however the mechanism is unknown. Inflammatory cytokines could not only mediate inflammatory reactions but also participate in the growth proliferation invasion and progression of tumor cells. It has been found that non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin can effectively prevent several inflammation related tumor and coincidentally PCa is also closely associated with inflammation. Moreover latest researches demonstrated that hormone therapy could induce tissue inflammation in PCa in which a large quantity of immune B cells were attracted into the focal and then a lot of cytokines such as IKK-β NF-κB were released. These cytokines could inhibit apoptosis and promote the growth of tumor cells which might be a possible mechanism for long-term inflammatory infiltration inducing the occurrence of PCa and the transformation to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Based on these proofs investigators presume it could be possibly an effective way to prevent the occurrence of PCa and the transformation from androgen-dependent prostate cancer to CRPC by means of long-term oral aspirin. In this study investigators intend to explore the possible effect of anti-inflammatory therapy on the progress of transformations from inflammation to PCa and from androgen-dependent prostate cancer to CRPC. Investigators plan to conduct both clinical trials in four groups including the control group the NSAIDs group the antibiotics group and the NSAIDs+antibiotics group and a basic experiment in vitro to assess the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs and elucidate the specific molecular mechanism.    ,NCT02757365

The other half will get the same information but not receive the food-package.    ,NCT02759380
Prostate Cancer,Fusion Guided Focal Laser Ablation of Prostate Cancer, Background: Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in U.S. men. Treatments for early or less aggressive disease are limited. Researchers want to test a device that destroys cancerous tissue with laser energy. They want to see if using it with ultrasound is more comfortable than using it with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Objectives: To test a cooled laser applicator system to treat prostate cancer lesions. To see if ultrasound imaging is a practical and feasible treatment with laser ablation for focal prostate cancer treatment. Eligibility: Men at least 18 years old with prostate cancer seen on MRI that has not spread in the body. Design: Participants will be screened with standard cancer care tests. These can include physical exam lab tests and MRI. For the MRI they lie in a machine that takes pictures. Participants will have a prostate biopsy. Needle samples will be taken from 12 places in the prostate. This will be guided by MRI and ultrasound which is obtained through a coil in the rectum. Participants will stay at the clinic for 1 2 days. A cooling catheter (plastic tube) will be put in the bladder. Ultrasound will guide the laser applicator directly to the tumor. The cooling catheter will be removed. A different catheter will be put in the urethra to keep the bladder emptied. The next day participants will have a physical exam and a PSA blood test. Participants will have 6 follow-up visits over 3 years. At each visit they will have a physical exam and lab tests. At some visits they will also have an MRI or other scans and a prostate biopsy.    ,NCT02759744
Prostate Cancer,Conventional Care Versus Radioablation (Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy) for Extracranial Oligometastases, Metastatic spread of cancer from its primary site to distant organs is the commonest cause of death from cancer. The term oligometastases describes an intermediate metastatic state in which cancer exists as a limited number of metastases at first before cells acquire the ability to metastasise more widely. For the large majority of solid cancers once metastatic disease has been diagnosed the chances of cure are small. There are several situations where this is not the case but it is not known if stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligometastatic disease will alter outcomes or whether the toxicity burden of this treatment is justified. SBRT is targeted radiotherapy which destroys cancer cells in the area of the body it is aimed at however low dose radiation may be received by surrounding tissue. It is difficult to quantify incidence of patients with multiple primary cancers developing at intervals that are representative of oligometastatic stage IV disease (defined for the purposes of this trial as ??3 metastatic sites). However an increase in the use of surveillance imaging together with improved diagnostic sensitivity has led to the diagnosis of patients with asymptomatic oligometastatic relapse becoming a more common clinical occurrence. The CORE study is a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in patients with cancer in one of three primary sites where oligometastatic disease relapse is a common clinical scenario: breast prostate and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will evaluate the use of SBRT in this patient population. Eligible patients who consent to participate in this clinical trial will be randomized to receive standard care or standard care plus SBRT we hope to recruit approximately 206 patients to the study and the primary outcome measure is progression free survival.    ,NCT02759783
Prostate Cancer,Does End-fire Technique Increase Detection Rate of Prostate Cancer at First Re-biopsy Compared to Side-fire Technique?, Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in Sweden. During investigation of suspected cancer transrectal ultrasound with needle biopsies from prostate leeds to diagnosis. The most common technique today is side-fire where the needle enter the prostate in angle from the probe. In end-fire technique the needle enters the prostate at tip of probe without angle. The difference in techniques side-fire vs. end-fire affects the possibility to reach the ventral and apical aspects of prostate. Today´s standard is at least five cores from each side of the prostate at first biopsy. If first sample is negative there will usually be another urological exam and a first re-biopsy. The study aim to compare these two methods in cancer detection. The investigators' hypothesis is that when using end-fire technique at first re-biopsy investigators find more cancers compared to side-fire. Patients are prospectively randomized into two groups both assessing 12 core biopsies according to study protocol. Primary endpoint is cancer detection. Data will be collected about patient age PSA-level prostate size digital rectal exam hypoechogenic zones and length of cancers.    ,NCT02761135

Prostate Cancer,Randomized Controlled Trial of ProstAtak® Immunotherapy During Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer (ULYSSES), The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ProstAtak® immunotherapy in patients undergoing active surveillance for localized prostate cancer. ProstAtak® involves the use of aglatimagene besadenovec (AdV-tk) to kill tumor cells and stimulate a cancer vaccine effect. Killing tumor cells in an immune stimulatory environment induces the body's immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells. ProstAtak® has been well tolerated in previous trials in patients with prostate cancer and other tumor types. Biochemical pathologic and immune responses have been demonstrated in newly diagnosed and recurrent prostate cancer. The hypothesis is that ProstAtak can lead to improvement in the clinical outcome for patients with prostate cancer. Participants will be randomized to the ProstAtak® or control arm at a 2:1 ratio. Both arms receive standard of care active surveillance evaluations.    ,NCT02768363

Prostate Cancer,Detection and Localization of Carcinoma Using High Resolution Transrectal Imaging - Proof of Concept Study, An exploratory feasibility and proof-of-concept study to evaluate the capability of a rectal probe scintigraphy device (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific radiopharmaceutical agent (ProstaScintÂ®; as a surrogate marker for prostate cancer) in patients who have undergone a radical prostatectomy for their disease patients with multiple negative prostate biopsies and patients with known primary prostate cancer. Developed by Hybridyne Imaging Technologies Inc. ProxiScanTM is a small cadmium zinc telluride (CST)-based compact gamma camera. It is the same size as a trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) currently used for prostate biopsy guidance. Men with multiple positive biopsies will be considered controls. Prostate cancer sextant biopsy histology results will be correlated with ProxiScanTM TRUS MRI and SPECT/CT. The investigators hypothesize that it will be safe and feasible to utilize a rectal probe scintigraphy (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific ProstaScintÂ® thus identifying and localizing the tumour sites within the prostate and surrounding areas.    ,NCT02786459

Prostate Cancer,STHLM3-MR: Comparing Standard With Targeted Prostate Biopsies, Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men in the Western world. Early detection of prostate cancer has been shown to decrease mortality but has limitations with low specificity leading to unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis of low-risk cancers. The STHLM3 trial has paved the way for improved specificity in early detection of prostate cancer using the blood-based STHLM3 test for identifying men at increased risk of harbouring significant prostate cancer. Targeted prostate biopsies based on MRI images have been shown to increase sensitivity of high-grade cancers compared to the currently used systematic biopsies but existing evidence are contradictory and not free from methodological flaws. The primary aim of STHLM3-MR/Fusion is to increase the specificity in early detection of prostate cancer without decreasing the sensitivity of aggressive prostate cancers by introducing targeted prostate biopsies and comparing to traditional prostate biopsies. The primary endpoints are the number of performed biopsies and the number of detected high-grade prostate cancers defined as Gleason 7 or higher. Secondary endpoints include the number of low risk prostate cancers diagnosed and the proportion of patients with up-or downgraded disease after assessment of prostatectomy specimen. Additional aims include to assess the health economic consequences of implementing MRI based prostate cancer diagnostics and to improve the quality and effectiveness of prostate cancer diagnosis in the routine health care in Stockholm. The STHLM3-MR/Fusion project will be performed in two separate phases analyzed separately. Based on power calculations approximately 500 planned for prostate biopsies will be included in the first phase. Men who have previously been diagnosed with prostate cancer may not take part in the study. The study period of Phase 1 is March 2016 to January 2017. The second phase will start in autumn 2016 and end by December 2017.    ,NCT02788825

This is a pilot study of dose painted permanent I-125 seed implant to verify absence of tumor cells outside a high risk region using multi-parametric MRI and deformable TRUS registration. The high risk region will be dose painted to 160 Gy and the rest of the prostate will receive the normal prescription dose.    ,NCT02790216
Prostate Cancer,Provenge Followed by Docetaxel in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, This clinical study will evaluate the role of combination therapy of Provenge followed by docetaxel for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC (prostate cancer that is resistant to medical or surgical treatments that lower testosterone). The purpose of this study is to look at the combination therapy of Provenge followed by docetaxel to correlate the immunological biomarkers with clinical results for therapy. Biomarkers are genes proteins and other molecules that affect how cancer cells grow multiply die and respond to other compounds in the body. The study drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Patients will receive Provenge followed by 6 cycles of docetaxel. Provenge is an immunotherapy (vaccine made from patient's own blood cells) that reprograms immune cells to attack cancer. A course of therapy consists of three doses of Provenge administered at 2-week intervals. Docetaxel is an antineoplastic (chemotherapy that affects cancer cell growth) agent. Docetaxel dose of 75 mg/m2 will be given intravenously as a 1-hour infusion every 21 days on Day 1 for 6 cycles (21 days). The strategy aims to determine whether cytokine production and T cell infiltration of tumor cells could favor regression using a combination of vaccine plus chemotherapy. Tissue endpoints will include biopsies prior to vaccine therapy and chemotherapy and at the end of therapy. Prostate cancer tissue infiltrates will be studied for expression of CD3 CD4 CD8 CD25/FOX3P CD56 CTLA-4 PD-1 and Ki67. Additional immunological endpoints will be secondary antigen spread and various cytokine biomarkers.    ,NCT02793219

Prostate Cancer,Correlation Between SUV on 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT and Gleason Score in Prostate Cancer, 1.0 Background & Introduction Positron emission tomography / computer tomography (PET/CT) is a nuclear medicine procedure based on the measurement of positron emission from radiolabelled tracers. This technology allows biologic processes to be visualized and measured on whole body images. Common radiotracers in use today in the USA and Europe are radiolabelled choline derivatives such as the analogs 18F-fluoromethylcholine (FMCh) and 18F-fluoroethylcholine (FECh) or more broadly FCH. Both of these fluorinated choline analogs have been extensively studied and display seemingly identical biological radiopharmaceutical and radiochemical properties. Both have been extensively studied in human prostate cancer with FMCh having slightly more published data than FECh. Imaging with radiolabelled choline derivatives is used to determine sites of abnormal choline metabolism and can be used to characterize prostate cancer for which there is extensive data in the literature. PET/CT with radiolabelled choline derivatives is considered standard of care by some experts where available however at the JGH anatomic imaging with CT and MRI and bone scan are the current diagnostic imaging modalities in use for this patient population. Prostate cancer cells have increased choline uptake compared to normal tissues forming the molecular basis for this technique. The Gleason score a histopathologic measure of tumor aggressiveness is one of the most important prognostic factors in the disease. The objective of this study is to evaluate if the degree of uptake measured by maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) on FCH PET/CT in prostate cancer correlates with Gleason score at initial biopsy. 2.0 Study Objectives The objective of this study is to evaluate if the patient-wide SUVmax on 18F-FCH PET/CT in locoregional and metastatic prostate cancer correlates with histopathologic Gleason score at initial biopsy. It is hypothesized that SUVmax will correlate positively with Gleason score. This is of interest because non-invasive risk stratification may be possible in the future. 3.0 Study Design This will be a single-site JGH-only open label study in which one (1) 18F-FCH PET/CT will be performed on study participants. A PET/CT scan takes about 3 hours. 4.0 Safety & Ethics The radiation dose to patients from fluorinated choline derivatives compares favorably to the major PET tracer in widespread clinical use 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). The safety of fluorinated choline derivatives is not disputed and the investigators expect the number of adverse events in this study to be at (or near) zero. There is no established toxicology for diagnostic doses of fluorinated choline derivatives. There are no salient ethical considerations identified. The treating physicians are free to order any diagnostic or therapeutic intervention on study patients and care will not be modified or restricted in any way.

Prostate Cancer,Correlation Between SUV on 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA (DKFZ-11) and Gleason Score in Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in North American men older than 50 years. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a unique membrane bound glycoprotein which is overexpressed manifold on prostate cancer cells and is well-characterized as an imaging biomarker of prostate cancer. Positron emission tomography / computer tomography (PET/CT) is a nuclear medicine procedure based on the measurement of positron emission from radiolabeled tracer molecules. 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA (DKFZ-11) (abbreviated 68Ga-PSMA) is a tracer for prostate cancer PET imaging. The strength of functional imaging methods is in distinguishing tissues according to metabolism rather than structure. Studies have shown that PET/CT imaging with 68Ga-PSMA can detect prostate cancer lesions with excellent contrast and a high detection rate even when the level of prostate specific antigen is low. Study Objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate if the patient-wide SUVmax on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in locoregional and metastatic prostate cancer correlates with histopathologic Gleason score at initial biopsy. It is hypothesized that SUVmax will correlate positively with Gleason score. This is of interest because non-invasive risk stratification may be possible in the future. This will be a single-site JGH-only open label study in which one (1) 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT will be performed on study participants. A PET/CT scan takes 2-3 hours.    ,NCT02796807

Prostate Cancer,MRI Versus PSA in Prostate Cancer Screening, In this open randomized controlled trial we seek to study whether prostate cancer screening using multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) improves the detection rate of clinically-significant prostate cancer (defined as Gleason score ?? on prostate biopsy) compared with prostate cancer screening using prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The current paradigm of prostate cancer screening relies upon an initial PSA blood test with subsequent investigations driven by the serum PSA level. This model has proven highly controversial due to the inability of PSA level to discern between indolent and aggressive forms of prostate cancer. As a result numerous government-sponsored bodies have recommended against PSA screening. Evidence suggests that prostate cancer screening has led to an increased proportion of men being diagnosed with potentially curable prostate cancer. However due to the inability of the PSA level to accurately distinguish patients with indolent and lethal forms of prostate cancer it has led to a significant rate of over-diagnosis of indolent disease. Magnetic resonance imaging has been gaining an increasingly large role in the management of patients with clinically-localized prostate cancer including diagnosis in patients with abnormal PSA levels monitoring of patients on active surveillance and staging prior to definitive interventions. MRI-based prostate cancer risk assessment has been shown to better distinguish between clinically-significant and insignificant tumors than PSA test. Therefore a randomized controlled trial of MRI-based prostate cancer screening and PSA-based prostate cancer screening is warranted.    ,NCT02799303
Prostate Cancer,Trial Comparing Irradiation Plus Long Term Adjuvant Androgen Deprivation With GnRH Antagonist Versus GnRH Agonist Plus Flare Protection in Patients With Very High Risk Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer, The primary objective of the trial is to assess if GnRH antagonists in combination with external beam radiation therapy improve progression free survival (progression that can be biological clinical or death) compared to GnRH agonists in combination with external beam radiation therapy. Secondary objectives include:   -  documentation of effect of GnRH antagonists on clinically significant cardiovascular events in the subgroup of patients at high risk of such events at baseline;   -  documentation of side effects and quality of life I-PSS and urinary tract infections;   -  assessment of relative treatment effect on secondary efficacy endpoints (clinical progression time to next line of systemic therapy time on therapy overall and cancer specific survival) and on PSA at 6 months after end of RT.    ,NCT02799706

Prostate Cancer,Longitudinal Evaluation of Intestinal Haematological and Urinary Toxicity From Pelvic Irradiation for Prostate Cancer, The prophylactic irradiation of pelvic lymph-nodes by means of Whole-Pelvis Radiotherapy (WPRT) in the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) is aimed at the timely eradication of microscopic lymph-nodal metastases. Nevertheless even though delivered by means of modern Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques WPRT may result in intestinal hematologic and urinary toxicity (IT HT UT respectively) severely affecting patients' daily health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) within the so-called and inadequately investigated Pelvic Radiation Disease. The aim of this study is to develop sophisticated predictive models of IMRT-WPRT induced patient-reported HT IT and UT in PCa. The possible correlation between several clinical factors and radiation doses received by various pelvic structures (i.e. pelvic bones subvolumes intestinal loops sigmoid rectum and bladder) and risk and severity of patient-reported IT UT and HT will be analyzed and robust multi-variable models will be developed and internally validated. A secondary end-point will be the identification of specific symptoms affecting patients' HRQoL during irradiation and in the long term overall and in different therapeutic settings (radical adjuvant and salvage). Lastly possible correlation between HT and UT/IT will be investigated.    ,NCT02803086

Prostate Cancer,Apalutamide Plus Intermittent Hormone Therapy Versus Intermittent Hormone Therapy Alone in Prostate Cancer," This study is open to men who have biochemical recurrence (BCR increased PSA) following local treatment of their prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard treatment option but is only effective for 16-24 months and has a number of side effects that impact quality of life. These side effects may include fatigue hot flushing loss of sex drive brain fog decreased bone mineral density loss of muscle mass mild anemia (low levels of red blood cells that can make people feel tired and weak) diabetes (low blood sugar) heart disease metabolic syndromes (sometimes called ""pre-diabetes"" and includes obesity increased blood pressure high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in blood) and risk of fractures. An alternative to continuous ADT is intermittent administration where patients are given ""breaks"" from ADT to let their testosterone levels return to baseline. There are a number of potential benefits to intermittent hormone therapy (IHT): (1) longer time to the development of resistance; (2) improved patient quality of life owing to recovery from adverse effects particularly sexual function; and (3) substantial cost savings owing to less time spent receiving medication. Leuprolide is the name of the ADT / IHT drug. Apalutamide is an investigational drug which means it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is an antitumor drug taken by mouth. The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of Apalutamide to extend the time between the first two injections of leuprolide and improve quality of life. This study will also look at the safety of Apalutamide and the effects that Apalutamide has on prostate cancer. Men will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to receive:   -  Group A: Leuprolide + Apalutamide or   -  Group B: Leuprolide only (until second leuprolide injection) then leuprolide + Apalutamide 45 men will be in Group A and 21 men will be in Group B. Leuprolide is given as an intramuscular shot that lasts for 3 months intermittently and Apalutamide is taken by mouth (4 tablets) daily. Each cycle is 4 weeks long. Intermittent treatment with Apalutamide + leuprolide will continue until continuous leuprolide is needed to maintain undetectable PSA levels (i.e. PSA levels rise above undetectable level unless leuprolide is given without pause every 3 months).

Prostate Cancer,Preoperative Brimonidine on IOP of Patients Undergoing RALP, Patients with prostate cancer undergoing robot assisted radical laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in steep Trendelenburg position (sTBURG) are noted to have elevated intraocular pressures (IOP) intraoperatively. One study showed an increase in IOP of 13 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) from baseline IOP levels intraoperatively. Other studies have shown the IOP to more than double intraoperatively during RALP in sTBURG. IOP is found to be directly related to angle of inclination and increases time dependently with sTBURG. The IOP may remain significantly elevated until the first postoperative day after RALP. There are no previously published data concerning the safe threshold for IOP elevation and the effects of this increased IOP on vision and on generalized eye health are still not entirely known. One study showed postoperative visual field defects in 28% (7/25) of patients who underwent RALP in sTBURG. It has been theorized that sTBURG and subsequent increased IOP are risk factors for postoperative vision loss (PVL). It is believed that the increased IOP decreases optic nerve perfusion pressure causing ischemic optic neuropathy. Some previously recommended ways to reduce the intraoperative IOP spike during RALP include shorter operating times decreased angle of inclination modified Trendelenburg position use of Propofol for maintenance anaesthesia and intraoperative topical hypotensive agents to reduce IOP. Given the challenges with some of the above options this study aims to evaluate the effect of pre-operative treatment with topical Brimonidine Tartrate 0.2% on the IOP of patients undergoing RALP with sTBURG. The goal is to prevent the anticipated IOP spike thereby reducing risk of postoperative vision loss.    ,NCT02818816

Investigators will enroll participants whose cancer has been treated with hormone therapy and now the cancer is not responding to the treatment (Castration -resistant) and so therefore will be started on chemotherapy. Investigators will enroll thirty (30) participants in this study.    ,NCT02830880
Prostate Cancer,CEUS Targeted Biopsies Compared to mpMRI Targeted and Systematic Biopsies for the Detection of Prostate Cancer, The current standard for Prostate Cancer (PCa) detection remains taking 10-12 systematic biopsies of the prostate. This approach leads to overdiagnosis of insignificant PCa on the one hand and underdiagnosis and undergrading of significant PCa on the other. multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) has seen an increasing uptake in the clinics for biopsy targeting but the value in biopsy naive patients remains controversial. With Contrast Enhanced UltraSound (CEUS) cancer induced neovascularisation can be visualised with the potential to improve ultrasound imaging for prostate cancer detection and localisation significantly. The past years numerous studies have been performed with CEUS all basing their results on subjective judgement of the investigator. To overcome these difficulties CEUS quantification techniques have been used with encouraging first results. These imaging techniques have been proposed to improve the yield of prostate biopsies and possibly replacing systematic biopsies. In this trial mpMRI imaging and CEUS + quantification are performed before primary biopsy. Using a fusion device targeted biopsies are taken from predefined MRI lesions and CEUS lesions together with standard systematic biopsies in the same patients by separate blinded clinicians. The main outcome measure is the per-patient (significant) prostate cancer detection rate for each of the biopsy regimens.    ,NCT02831920

Prostate Cancer,ADT Exercise Trial and Economic Analysis, Prostate Cancer (PC) affects 1 in 7 men. Nearly half of those diagnosed with PC will receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as part of their treatment. ADT is good at managing PC but has many side effects. Researchers have shown that exercise specifically one-on-one supervised exercise improves many of the side effects of ADT. However exercise programs for men on ADT are not widely available. More questions need to be answered in order for exercise programs to become part of PC treatment. First can programs that require fewer resources such as group-exercise or home-based exercise also improve ADT side-effects? Second do exercise-related benefits continue beyond the structured exercise program? And what makes people continue exercising? Third which exercise program is most cost-effective? In this study the investigators will compare: (a) group supervised in-centre and (b) home-based supported exercise programs to see which program is most effective for men with PC on ADT. The investigators will also look at what motivates people to continue to exercise both during a structured program and after the program is complete and will examine which exercise program is most cost-effective. Participants (men with PC on ADT) will be recruited from one of the following cancer centres: Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary the Juravinski Cancer Centre in Hamilton and the Southlake Regional Health Centre in Newmarket. When a patient agrees to participate patient will be randomly placed in 1 of 2 exercise programs. All programs will include the same type of exercises (aerobic resistance and flexibility) and all participants will exercise 4-5 days per week for 30 minutes per day (as tolerated) for the length of the program (6 months). The investigators will look at how men with PC on ADT respond to the exercise program by measuring quality of life (QOL) fatigue and different physical measures before during and after the exercise program. Although the investigators know that supervised one-on-one exercise is most effective at improving ADT side-effects it is unknown if other forms of exercise are just as beneficial and more financially responsible. This study will allow the investigators to begin to answer these questions so that structured exercise programs become a regular part of PC treatment.    ,NCT02834416

Prostate Cancer,Transrectal Ultrasound Robot-Assisted Prostate Biopsy, The commonly used diagnostic procedure for prostate cancer a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy has significant limitations. Freehand biopsy cores are often spatially clustered rather than uniformly distributed and do not accurately follow the recommended sextant template. In addition a freehand TRUS-guided biopsy does not allow precise mapping of the biopsy cores within the prostate. Therefore it is nearly impossible to re-biopsy or target the exact cancer foci. As a result most TRUS-guided prostate biopsies today are poorly targeted and their spatial mapping remains subjective.    ,NCT02871726

Prostate Cancer,Formal Consensus Method to Evaluate the Conformity of Prescription of a Recently Approved Chemotherapy Treatment in an Observatory Study, Cabazitaxel is a second line chemotherapy drug recently approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. To investigate whether the precautions for the use of cabazitaxel (contraindications hepatic function premedication for hypersensitivity prophylactic treatments dose and dose adjustment as well as conditions of administration) are respected in routine practice an observational cohort study will be implemented in 32 oncology centres of South-West region of France (CABOBS study). The primary objective of this cohort is to evaluate the conformity of cabazitaxel prescriptions with the Summary of Product haracteristics (SPC) in clinical practice (indications and monitoring methods) and according to the conditions of use. Panel of experts were convened to assess the conformity of prescription of cabazitaxel with a Delphi consensus method. The Delphi method is most suited to areas where a limited number of evidences are available to enable a recommendation or guidelines to be drawn. Moreover all the evaluated items came from an official document provided by the EMA the SPC of cabazitaxel. Thus it is expected from the experts to select the most relevant items. In the frame of the CABOBS study this method will allow to select items of the SPC list according to their importance and to define the primary objective of conformity to cabazitaxel conditions of use.    ,NCT02882178

Prostate Cancer,Improving Bio-availability of the Expensive Oral Oncolytic Drug Abiraterone by Food Intake, Abiraterone is a selective inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis that potently and irreversibly blocks CYP17 a crucial enzyme in testosterone and estrogen synthesis. A pro-drug of abiraterone abiraterone acetate (Zytiga®) was developed to overcome its poor bio-availability and is fully converted to the active moiety abiraterone. Abiraterone acetate tablets are administered at a fixed oral dose of 1000mg QD in a fasted state in combination with 10mg prednisolon daily. Abiraterone acetate has a low solubility in aqueous media and a low permeability. The bioavailability of abiraterone acetate is significantly influenced when ingested with food. Ingesting abiraterone acetate with a low fat or a high fat meal resulted respectively in a 5- or 10-fold increase in AUC0-?? The high and low fat FDA meals used in these food effect studies differ largely from breakfasts taken in everyday life (ca. 800-1000 cal). A continental breakfast contains 160 to 320 calories of which 25-50% is fat is more compatible with a normal lifestyle and therefore easily sustainable in daily practice. However the effect of a continental breakfast on the absorption of abiraterone is unknown yet. Furthermore increasing healthcare costs are a growing concern in all developed countries. Therefore effort should be invested to keep anticancer treatment affordable. A food intervention resulting in a better absorption and enhanced exposure to abiraterone can lead to a reduced dose which could significantly impact health care costs for a tumor which is as prevalent as metastatic prostate cancer. Therefore the investigators want to perform a bioequivalent study to investigate what dose of abiraterone with a continental breakfast equals the dose of 1000mg taken in fasted conditions.    ,NCT02883166
Prostate Cancer,Utility of Dynamic Variables Measured by Calibrated Pulse Contour Analysis of Oesophageal Doppler Monitor for Predicting Fluid Responsiveness During Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy, Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is widely performed due to its many advantages including a reduced need for blood transfusion and fewer surgical complications compared with conventional open prostatectomy. As this approach is also recommended in elderly patients with serious comorbidities optimal fluid therapy guidance during this procedure is important. Dynamic variables such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV) are used to predict and guide fluid therapy during controlled ventilation. These variables arise from heart-lung interactions during positive pressure ventilation which influence left ventricular stroke volume (SV). RALP requires carbon dioxide insufflation and the steep Trendelenburg position to optimise surgical conditions and can reduce cardiac output and respiratory compliance. Accordingly the usefulness of PPV and SVV which are affected by changes in intrathoracic pressure in predicting fluid responsiveness during laparoscopic surgery under these conditions may be questioned. A recent study established that PPV and SVV derived by uncalibrated pulse contour analysis had a relatively poor capacity to predict fluid responsiveness during laparoscopy on dynamic preload indices. In contrast another study SVV measured by oesophageal Doppler monitor (ODM) could predict fluid responsiveness during laparoscopic surgery. The CardioQ-ODM+ combines the proven ODM Doppler measurement of blood flow with pulse contour analysis which is quickly and easily calibrated from the Doppler signal. We hypothesized that PPV and SVV measured by calibrated pulse contour analysis would be a good indicator of fluid responsiveness during laparoscopy with pneumoperitoneum. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that PPV and SVV measured by calibrated pulse contour analysis of CardioQ-ODM+ can accurately predict fluid responsiveness during RALP which involves both pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position. Investigators also assessed the capacity of other dynamic variables (SPV [systolic pressure variation] and SVV determined by ODM Doppler flow dynamic elastance [PPV/SVV] and corrected flow time [FTc]) to predict fluid responsiveness during RALP.    ,NCT02886546

Prostate Cancer,Androgen-Deprivation Therapy and Cardiovascular Risk: A Nationwide Population-based Cohort Study, The research focuses on the safety profile of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). The hypothesis is that safety issue as regards to cardiovascular risk is not homogenous across the spectrum of androgen-deprivation therapy modalities. Our study will encompass all ADT modalities including intermittent ADT. ADT is a cornerstone therapy in prostate cancer management. Decisions about ADT should weigh improvements in cancer-specific outcomes against potential increased risks for cardiovascular diseases. The potential for harm from ADT should be more precisely defined according to the type of ADT. Those potential risks underscore the importance of better understanding benefits of ADT especially in contexts where data are still lacking.ADT is also indicated in sexually deviant behavior.    ,NCT02895230

Prostate Cancer,SPCG17: Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Trigger Trial, A large proportion of men with prostate cancer are overdiagnosed and overtreated mainly due to PSA testing. Active surveillance (AS) aims to reduce these harms by recommending curative treatment only when and if signs of tumor progression occur. There are however a number of uncertainties in AS the most important being when to initiate treatment. The investigators are therefore starting a large randomized multicenter trial testing a standardized active surveillance protocol with specified triggers for repeat biopsies and initiation of curative treatment. The standardized protocol is compared with current practice for active surveillance. The primary aim of the study is to reduce overtreatment and subsequent side effects without increasing the risk of disease progression or prostate cancer mortality.    ,NCT02914873

Prostate Cancer,HDR Focal: Feasibility Study, Brachytherapy as a monotherapy treatment is highly effective for localized prostate cancer traditionally being delivered to the whole prostate gland. Lately low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy has been increasingly replaced by high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment schemes. While brachytherapy's oncologic outcomes are excellent it is not without incidence adverse effects including urinary rectal and sexual toxicities that affect the patient's quality of life. This study will incorporate HDR monotherapy treatment option for early stages and favourable risk prostate cancer. Additionally we aim to evaluate the role of focal HDR brachytherapy for well-defined disease based on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). This approach may offer an option of reducing the treatment toxicities while maintaining oncologic outcomes when compared with whole-gland therapy. Advantages in quality of life could be exhibited in the form of reduced urinary discomfort and incontinence rectal symptoms and improved erectile and prostatic gland function. This study would be particularly relevant in the current era of earlier localized prostate cancer detection where newer imaging modalities (e.g. mpMRI) become a routine component of patient care.    ,NCT02918253

Our hypothesis is that the change of prednisone to dexamethasone in CRPC patients that progress biochemically to AA + prednisone can improve the number and the length of the responses and also improve tolerance to treatment decreasing the adverse events associated to a moderate dosage of steroids used chronically.    ,NCT02928432
Prostate Cancer,Minocycline Attenuate Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction and Delirium, Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and postoperative delirium occurs mainly in aged patients. POCD and POD may increase the mortality and morbidity. However the mechanism of POCD is not clear yet and no effective therapy method was proved. According to previous study the neuroinflammation is the main reason both for POCD and POD. Minocycline is a tetracycline derivative. Due to it's lipophilic structure it is easy to pass through blood brain barrier and attenuate neuroinflammation. It's neuroprotective effects has been proven in many experimental animal models such as Alzheimer's disease Huntington's disease and Parkinson's syndrome. In present study the investigators hypothesized that minocycline would attenuate the incidence of POCD and POD in the aged patients.    ,NCT02928692

Prostate Cancer,Cooking Class Intervention Project for Men With Prostate Cancer and Their Partners, Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in Canada with 24000 new cases estimated for 2015. Prostate cancer patients often live with uncomfortable side effects of treatment such as a decrease in bone health weight gain and challenges to their interpersonal relationships. Nutrition can improve outcomes for PCa survivors; however dietary interventions for prostate cancer patients are limited. Therefore this is a feasibility study that tests the impact of an innovative intervention to promote healthy nutrition and weight control for prostate cancer survivors and their partners. The objectives are to assess the feasibility of the intervention specifically:   -  Accrual retention and adherence and participant satisfaction   -  Candidate measures for primary outcomes in future studies The intent is to evaluate how well the classes work and identify ways to make them more successful. At the end of the study the investigators will know if this approach shows merit to be tested further through a randomized controlled trial.    ,NCT02954289
Prostate Cancer,PROstaTe Cancer - Exercise-STudy (PRO-TEST), Background and purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of exercise on intratumoral natural killer (NK)-cell variability in patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. The primary hypothesis is that exercise induces epinephrine-mediated intratumoral natural killer (NK)-cell infiltration in patients with localized prostate cancer and that the infiltration is greater in patients performing High Intensity Interval Training compared to moderate intensity training. Currently there is a lack of randomized controlled trials examining different types of exercise in patients with localized prostate cancer. Moreover there is a need for studies including biological measurements to allow a full assessment of the effect of exercise on diverse biomarkers and mechanistic pathways which may influence cancer survival. Subjects: Patients with histologically verified prostate adenocarcinoma scheduled for radical prostatectomy at Urologic Department Rigshospitalet Copenhagen Denmark. Methods: In this randomized controlled pilot study 30 patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy will be included and randomized to either High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) exercise intervention Moderate-Intensity Aerobic Exercise and Resistance Training (MI-AT+RT) intervention (standard recommendations) or observational control receiving usual care for a total period of 8 weeks. All patients will undergo assessments at inclusion (baseline) and after 8 weeks (5-7 days prior to surgery) respectively. Assessments include: anthropometrics; blood pressure; resting hearth rate; cardiorespiratory fitness by cardiopulmonary exercise test (VO2 peak.); body composition by DXA scan; quality of life by self-report questionnaires; oral glucose tolerance test; fasting blood sample measuring cholesterol triglycerides insulin c-peptide HbA1c glucose hormones and inflammatory markers. Also the investigators will collect blood samples before during and after an acute exercise bout in order to explore the acute systemic changes in exercise-regulated biomarkers. Biological tissue from tumor (primary prostate biopsies) will be retrieved from the respective local pathological departments and from the perioperative prostate specimen and sent to protocol analyses.    ,NCT02954783

Prostate Cancer,A Phase Ib Study of Intravenous Copper Loading With Oral Disulfiram in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and optimal dosing of intravenous copper chloride and disulfiram in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Eligible men will have neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) adenocarcinoma CRPC with non-liver/peritoneal metastases (lymph nodes bone or lung) or adenocarcinoma CRPC with liver and/or peritoneal metastases. Subjects will receive three doses of intravenous copper chloride and take disulfiram and oral copper gluconate until disease progression (up to two years). Subjects will also undergo a PET scan with radioactive copper 64 to measure the levels of copper in their tumor. The central hypotheses of this project are that (a) copper chloride and disulfiram are safe to give together and that (b) the combination of disulfiram with copper will have efficacy for both mCRPC and NEPC.    ,NCT02963051

Prostate Cancer,Assess Gamma H2AX Positivity in Circulating Prostate Cancer Cells Before and After Radium 223, This is a prospective biomarker study on prostate cancer patients receiving Radium 223 as standard of care. Participants will take part in this research study because they have chosen Radium 223 treatment for their prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and causing pain. Investigators want to find out if a blood test performed before and after the Radium 223 treatment will help to understand how prostate cancer cells react to this therapy. In this pilot study researchers want to find out if Radium 223 given as part of standard treatment for prostate cancer can decrease the number of circulating prostate cancer cells. Radium 223 kills prostate cancer cells by damaging their DNA. Other than looking at the changes in the number of circulating prostate cancer cells before and after Radium 223 researchers would also like to look at the changes in a DNA damage marker called gamma H2AX in the circulating prostate cancer cells before and after treatment with Radium 223. Assessing the DNA damage marker gamma H2AX is investigational. It is performed in the same tube of blood that is used for assessing the changes in the number of circulating prostate cancer cells.    ,NCT02981797

Prostate Cancer,Collection and Measurement of Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy Patients, Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men and nearly 30000 deaths occur from the disease each year. Not only is there significant mortality there is also considerable morbidity from primary and salvage therapies. Understanding which patients require intensified treatment as well as those who might not require treatment would improve outcomes on multiple levels. The cohort to be investigated will be comprised of men with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer who are candidates for radiotherapy (RT). The overarching objective of the CoMBINe trial is to identify pretreatment and post-treatment prognostic and predictive factors derived from quantitative imaging prostate features tumor tissue gene expression signatures and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The CoMBINe trial is a sister trial to another study termed BLaStM (IRB# 20140627) in men who are candidates for radiotherapy. CoMBINe also allows for men with oligometastasis who are sometimes treated with RT to the prostate and limited metastatic sites.    ,NCT02997709

Prostate Cancer,Correlation Between SUV on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and Gleason Score in Prostate Cancer, Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a unique membrane bound glycoprotein which is overexpressed manifold on prostate cancer cells and is well-characterized as an imaging biomarker of prostate cancer. Positron emission tomography / computer tomography (PET/CT) is a nuclear medicine procedure based on the measurement of positron emission from radiolabeled tracer molecules. 18F-DCFPyL is a tracer for prostate cancer PET imaging which binds to PSMA. The strength of functional imaging methods is in distinguishing tissues according to metabolism rather than structure. Studies have shown that PET/CT imaging with 18F-DCFPyL can detect prostate cancer lesions with excellent contrast and a high detection rate even when the level of prostate specific antigen is low. The objective of this study is to evaluate if the patient-wide SUVmax on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in locoregional and metastatic prostate cancer correlates with histopathologic Gleason score at initial biopsy. It is hypothesized that SUVmax will correlate positively with Gleason score. This is of interest because non-invasive risk stratification may be possible in the future.    ,NCT03001895
Prostate Cancer,Trial of Rad-223 Activity in Asymptomatic Patients With mCRPC While on Abiraterone or Enzalutamide Besides AR-V7 Status, Radium-223 is indicated for the treatment of patients with mCRPC with symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease. However very few data have been reported in patients with mCRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Recently results from an International Expanded Access Program have also suggested a benefit of radium-223 in asymptomatic patients with mCRPC. In addition the mechanism of action of radium-223 should not be correlated with the presence/absence of the AR-V7 mutation although this issue has not yet been evaluated. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of radium-223 in asymptomatic patients with mCRPC and to establish the association between AR-V7 status and radium-223 activity.    ,NCT03002220

Prostate Cancer,Robotic Surgery After Focal Ablation Therapy, The toxicity of traditional prostate cancer therapies including radical surgery and external beam radiation is well known. This has prompted a move towards focal therapy where only the cancerous part of the prostate is treated. To date studies have demonstrated very promising outcomes following focal therapy with the majority of men maintaining their urinary and sexual function after therapy. In a small proportion of men disease recurs after focal therapy. The optimal treatment for men with recurrent disease after focal therapy is yet to be defined. Patients may undergo further focal therapy to the recurrent disease undergo radiation therapy whole-gland therapy using a minimally invasive approach such as High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) or cryotherapy. Alternatively patients may undergo radical surgery where the whole prostate is removed. To date the side-effects or toxicity of any treatment for recurrent prostate cancer after focal therapy has not been formally studied. Traditionally the side effects of surgery and radiation therapy performed in patients that have already undergone previous prostate cancer treatment have been considerable with high rates of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. However as focal therapy leaves a significant area of the prostate untreated the investigators believe surgery after focal prostate therapy will be associated with a much lower incidence of urinary and sexual dysfunction. The aim of the RAFT study is to characterise the side effects of prostate cancer surgery in men that have undergone prior focal ablation therapy. In addition the investigators wish to perform a number of basic science studies to attempt to better understand why the patient has experienced recurrent prostate cancer after focal therapy.    ,NCT03011606

Prostate Cancer,PC 360 Survivorship, Prostate Cancer Survivorship 360º is a collaboration-based initiative involving prostate cancer (PC) and survivorship researchers/clinicians from three Canadian prostate centers with the goal of identifying and tracking unmet supportive care needs of patients with localized PC and responding to these needs through survivorship care. The current randomized control trail (RCT) will focus on the development and evaluation of a facilitated electronic Prostate Cancer Survivorship Care Plan (PC-SCP). The aims of this project are: 1) to develop an appropriate and tailored SCP and transition care delivery process; and 2) to conduct an RCT to evaluate whether a personalized PC SCP intervention is more effective than usual care (UC) on patient activation (primary outcome) and access to services self-Management support satisfaction with information HRQoL and cancer worry (secondary outcomes). Data from a multi-site prospective database- Prostate Cancer Survivorship Information System (PC360-IS) will be used to electronically populate the survivorship care plans. Overall this proposal represents initial steps in uniting the country in sharing programmatic resources data expertise and enthusiasm to transform survivorship care for men with PC and their families.    ,NCT03017456
Prostate Cancer,Evaluation of Neuroendocrine Differentiation as a Potential Mechanism of Tumor Recurrence Following Radiotherapy in Prostate Carcinoma, This is a pilot study to test a hypothesis that a greater increase in serum chromogranin A (CgA) after a definitive radiotherapy (RT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer recurrence after RT. Serum CgA level is measured before the start of RT and/or the start of neoadjuvant ADT for patients undergoing a definitive RT with or without ADT. CgA is also measured at various pre-defined post-RT time points. The study will analyze the followings: 1. Change in CgA level at various pre-defined post-RT time points from the baseline 2. Correlation between the extent of post-therapy CgA change and Gleason score of malignancy 3. Correlation between the extent of post-therapy CgA change and treatment outcome.    ,NCT03017794
Prostate Cancer,Explaining the Invisible, Radiotherapy uses high doses of x-rays directed at tumours to kill them an unfortunate side effect is healthy surrounding tissue will receive some of the x-ray dose and is damaged. Approximately 22% of radiotherapy patients receive treatment to cure prostate cancer. The technique used requires patients to maintain full bladder and empty bowel because they are next to the prostate the aim of radiotherapy planning is to minimise the radiation dose received to healthy organs and tissues as this will reduce side effects. PEARL is commercial interactive PC software that shows realistic and functional 3D models of Linac's (machines that deliver radiotherapy treatment). Using PEARL it's possible to display realistic patient treatments including how an individual would be laid on a treatment couch and how the machine will move and sound during treatment. Additionally PEARL provides the opportunity to look inside the body to view internal anatomy and show where the radiotherapy treatment is directed. Information prior to treatment in radiotherapy is normally given verbally one to one. The investigators believe this information can be more easily understood if PEARL is used in conjunction with this verbal exchange. PEARL gives visual and audio representation of the treatment experience and demonstrates the reasons behind required preparations. Research aim is to demonstrate patients who receive information using PEARL have greater understanding reduced anxiety and reduced radiation dose. This will be tested using two groups of patients receiving radiotherapy to the prostate. Group A - Verbal information Group B - Verbal information and PEARL demonstration. Data collection is via patient questionnaires and review of Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT) images that are taken prior to each radiotherapy treatment as standard practice. CBCT's are used to locate the treatment area and assess bladder and bowel status and ensure all of these are suitable to deliver treatment accurately.    ,NCT03025633

Prostate Cancer,Nivolumab in Prostate Cancer With Mutations in DNA Repair Defects (ImmunoProst Trial), Prostate Cancer (PC) is the most frequent cancer in men accounting for 21% of new cases of cancer in men in the United States. Among the four most incident tumors (breast lung and colorectal cancer); prostate cancer is the only that does not have any predictive biomarker to guide the treatment. Even though the molecular heterogeneity of PC is well-documented treatment has not been molecularly stratified and the need for genetic prognostic and predictive markers is critical. DNA repair defects (DRD) mainly in the Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway (such as BRCA1 BRCA2 ATM and CHEK2) are emerging as potential biomarkers in prostate cancer. It is well known BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers have better Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) than non-carriers in ovarian cancer. Differently than ovarian tumors that BRCA mutations provides a good prognosis PC patients who harbor HR defects have a higher Gleason score 6 an increased risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. The predictive role of DRD in PC was demonstrated in a recent trial using Olaparib a PARP inhibitor in DRD carriers. This trial showed 88% of response rate with Olaparib a PARP inhibitor that acts in HR pathway by synthetic lethality. Recent data demonstrated important association between HR deficient high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) high neoantigen load and high expression of PD-1/PD-L1 compared with HR proficient HGSOCs 10. This study showed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations increase the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and confer a better prognosis. The unprecedented success of immunotherapy in malignant disorders has provided evidence that the patient's immune system can be improved to attack established tumors mainly melanoma non-small cell lung cancer and kidney cancer. A high mutational burden increases the likelihood of the development of specific neoepitopes that would confer clinical benefit from CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade. These data showed that specific DNA repair defects increase the mutational burden the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and TILs; and could improve the response to immunotherapy in cancer. This rationale was already tested in a trial that evaluated the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor Pembrolizumab in mismatch-repair deficient patients a kind of DNA repair defect by definition. This important trial showed that this DRD predicted clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade in many types of cancer especially colorectal cancer.    ,NCT03040791

Prostate Cancer,Cohorts of Docetaxel or Cabazitaxel in Combination With the Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitor Clarithromycin, This clinical trial is being conducted to recommend a safe and tolerable phase 2 dose of docetaxel or cabazitaxel when combined with clarithromycin in men who have developed castrate-resistant prostate cancer. In the castrate-resistant setting resistance to taxane therapy inevitably develops. Men who develop resistance to taxanes have a very poor prognosis and few treatment options. It is believed that CYP enzymes contribute to docetaxel and cabazitaxel resistance in metastatic prostate cancer and this resistance can be mitigated through pharmacologic CYP inhibition. In this study a potent CYP3A inhibitor clarithromycin will be co-administered concurrently with either docetaxel or cabazitaxel whose systemic metabolism is dependent of CYP3A4 with the intent to overcome resistance to taxanes.    ,NCT03043989
Prostate Cancer,Discerning Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Transperineal Targeted Biopsy Compared to Standard Transrectal Biopsy, Prostate biopsies are currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Many biopsies however are unnecessary or cannot detect significant prostate cancer (PCa). With multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) we now potentially have a way of increasing the detection of detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) while decreasing the detection of non-significant PCa. The goals and the objective of this study are as follows keeping this in mind.    ,NCT03044197

Prostate Cancer,Trial of ADT and SBRT Versus SBRT for Intermediate Prostate Cancer, Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a very precise form of radiation therapy that allows the physician to deliver more radiation dose in a single session. Because of this the number of radiation sessions can be reduced from the typical 45-48 sessions as in conventional daily session radiation to 5 sessions given every other day over a week and a half. Giving the radiation at a higher dose during each treatment may be more effective in killing the prostate cancer cells than the standard way of using external radiation therapy where a small amount of radiation is given over many sessions. Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) or hormonal therapy is one of the methods to treat intermediate risk prostate cancer. This therapy works by reducing the level of testosterone and stopping them from affecting your cancer. The ADT used in this study is known as Degarelix. Degarelix is an approved medication that reduces the body's production of testosterone; this medication is usually given to all men with intermediate risk prostate cancer getting external radiation. This study is a randomized study to find out whether combining stereotactic (also known as precision) radiation to the prostate cancer combined with a short course of Degarelix will result in a greater likelihood of killing the cancer in the prostate compared to stereotactic radiation therapy given alone. It has been shown that the combination of radiation with medications that interfere with testosterone production and its effects makes prostate cancer cells more sensitive to the radiation.    ,NCT03056638

Prostate Cancer,Zinc/PSA Ratio as a Novel Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Detection, Although Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is a useful marker for early detection of the prostate cancer its specivity is not sufficient. Several PSA variations were defined in order to increase the specivity of the test but they aren't much more effective than the PSA alone for detection of disease. In older studies reported that serum and prostatic tissue zinc levels decreased in prostat cancer disease. In our study we aimed to establish the utility of serum zinc PSA free PSA/PSA (fPSA/tPSA) zinc/PSA levels for early detection of the prostate cancer.    ,NCT02013180
Prostate Cancer,Multi-Institutional Registry for Prostate Cancer Radiosurgery, To address pertinent questions regarding the utilization of stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) to treat prostate cancer. The Florida Robotic Radiosurgery Association (FRRA) launched the first registry for prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT. The registry is designed to track surrogate treatment endpoints including prostate specific antigen (PSA) international prostate symptom score (IPSS)sexual health in men (SHIM) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores in addition to physical and survival data. Utilizing an independent vendor (Advertek Inc.) experienced with the design and implementation of similar electronic registries FRRA developed a data collection tool that staff members with a basic medical background can use to register and upload pertinent patient data requiring no more than 20 to 30 minutes per patient. Participating patients will be monitored in follow-up for three years with analysis and publication of the results semi-annually.    ,NCT01226004
Prostate Cancer,The IMPACT Study - Identification of Men With a Genetic Predisposition to ProstAte Cancer, The IMPACT study is an international targeted prostate screening study of men at increased prostate cancer risk due to the presence of known pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. There are only approximately 150 men with a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation in the UK. Research has shown that these men are at an increased risk of developing prostate cancer but more information is needed about the pathogenesis of prostate cancer in this defined group and the role of screening in these men. The study will offer annual PSA screening to these men to determine the incidence of prostate cancer in this group. The study will also look at new markers of early prostate cancer in this cohort. The power calculations for this study are 850 carriers and 850 controls (age-matched men without BRCA1/2 mutations). It is therefore essential to gain international collaboration to meet the target of recruiting 850 men with these known mutations and a control group of 850 men who have tested negative for a known familial mutation.    ,NCT00261456

Prostate Cancer,Prehabilitation for Prostate Cancer Surgery, Radical prostatectomy is the most common and effective treatment for localized prostate cancer. Unfortunately radical prostatectomy is associated with significant adverse effects such as urinary incontinence sexual dysfunction and reduced physical function that collectively diminish health-related quality of life which may persist for up to two years postoperatively. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the feasibility of conducting of a multi-site randomized controlled trial to test the effect of a comprehensive prehabilitation program versus standard care for men with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. We hypothesize that men with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy in the comprehensive prehabilitation program (full-body exercises and pelvic floor muscle exercises) will report better health-related quality of life urological symptoms and physical fitness physical activity and pain as well as a shorter postoperative length of stay than participants receiving standard preoperative care (pelvic floor muscle exercises alone).

Prostate Cancer,Advanced Pelvic Floor Training Program for Prostate Cancer Surgery, Radical prostatectomy is a common and effective treatment for prostate cancer but is associated with urinary incontinence that can persist for several months after surgery and significantly reduce quality of life. Studies have shown that routine performance of pelvic floor exercises after radical prostatectomy can aid in the recovery of urinary control; however conventional pelvic floor exercises do not produce consistent results. Research indicates that incorporating other deep abdominal muscles can further activate the pelvic floor making it stronger than by activating the pelvic floor alone. Specifically 'Pfilates' and 'Hypopressives' are two new techniques that combine traditional pelvic floor exercises with activation of supportive muscles. Our proposed study will be the first to test the effect of an advanced pelvic floor exercise training program that includes Pfilates and Hypopressives to treat urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy. Our primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale RCT of an advanced pelvic floor exercise training program including standard pelvic floor exercises Pfilates and Hypopressives techniques on urinary incontinence. Feasibility will be determined by measuring recruitment success retention outcome capture and intervention adherence tolerance and safety. We hypothesize men under going radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in the advance pelvic floor training program will report greater improvement in urinary incontinence and health-related quality of life.    ,NCT02233608

Prostate Cancer,Pilot Study of Whole Gland Salvage HDR Prostate Brachytherapy for Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer, Radiation therapy is considered a standard treatment option for the management of localized prostate cancer. Among the 20-30% of patients who recur there is no consensus on the optimal salvage therapy. Salvage options available for isolated local recurrence include; temporary or permanent implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate complete removal of the prostate gland use of low temperatures to treat the disease (cryotherapy) and high frequency ultrasound to treat the disease. There are risks of complications associated with all these treatments and there is presently no consensus as to which treatment is the best.

Prostate Cancer,Salvage Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer Patients With Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy, Despite continuous technical improvements in urologic surgery up to 40% of prostate cancer patients will develop biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) potentially because of micro metastasis at the time of the primary surgery. With improved radiological modalities and nuclear medicine tracers like 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT which allow the localization of the site of recurrence there is increasing interest in metastasis directed therapies such as salvage lymph node dissection. The pelvic extended salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) is a promising option for treating prostate cancer patients with local recurrence after radical prostatectomy with curative intent. Several retrospective series has been published to determine the local value of sLND. Despite the first data seem to be feasible and promising to date no prospective evaluation has been made. Thus sLND is still experimental according to the guidelines and is considered as an off label therapy. This prospective single center phase I/II study was conducted to investigate the safety and early efficacy of salvage lymph node dissection in prostate cancer patients with local pelvic recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) with curative intention.    ,NCT02974075
Prostate Cancer,A Pragmatic Trial of the Effect of a Mailed Patient Flyer About Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Testing Prior to an Annual Exam, 1. Does a one-page American College of Physicians educational flyer about the pros and cons of prostate cancer screening sent to men within two weeks of their scheduled annual health examinations in a general medicine clinic result in a different rate of prostate cancer screening than among men who were not sent the flyer?   2. Do patients find the flyer useful and understandable? Context: The use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer is controversial because of a lack of evidence that such screening saves lives when applied within a population and because such testing can lead to invasive downstream biopsies and aggressive treatment that is associated with a high risk of permanent side effects (e.g. impotence incontinence). Almost all professional societies (American Cancer Society American Urologic Association American College of Physicians United States Preventive Services Task Force) advocate that patients receive education and complete an informed decision-making discussion with their medical providers about the pros and cons of the PSA test as well as their personal preferences before proceeding with this test. Unfortunately despite these recommendations there is seldom sufficient time during clinic visits to achieve this goal.    ,NCT01516801

Further chemotherapy does not normally lead to a cure or dramatic improvement in the disease and there is a need to identify new drugs that are beneficial for these patients without unacceptable side effects. Prodrug chemotherapy is an approach in which an inactive non-toxic agent is administered to the patient and gets activated within the body at specific locations resulting in a higher concentration of the cytotoxic form at a tumour location whilst avoiding general side effects. G-202 is an example of prodrug chemotherapy. It does not have many general side effects because it is converted to a cell toxin only at the tumour or other specific locations in the body. G-202 is activated by Prostate Specific Memory Antigen (PSMA) a substance expressed by prostate cancer cells and in the blood vessels of most solid tumours but not by normal cells or blood vessels in normal tissue. It is believed that activation of the prodrug G-202 will allow the drug to kill cancer cells particularly prostate cancer cells. This study will evaluate the activity and safety of G-202 in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which means the cancer has progressed after hormone blocking treatment but who have not yet received chemotherapy and who have no or only a few symptoms from their CRPC. The study will evaluate clinical activity and safety of G-202 administered on three consecutive days of a 28-day cycle.    ,NCT01734681
Prostate Cancer,FACBC Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography(PET/CT) Used in the Diagnosis of Primary Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this research project is to test if a compound (chemical substance) has a natural tendency to go to prostate cancer. This compound has a small amount of radioactivity attached to it and is called a radiotracer. The name of the radiotracer is FACBC and can be detected on a special imaging device called a PET scanner (positron emission tomography). The radiotracer is treated in the body much like an amino acid which is a nutrient required for normal functioning. Tumors also use these nutrients. Earlier studies have shown that this radiotracer may be able to detect prostate cancer. The investigators will perform a study with 20 patients in whom they know have prostate cancer after a biopsy and who are scheduled for an operation in which the prostate is removed and the nearby lymph nodes are examined. This operation is called prostatectomy. The investigators think that this radiotracer can help us determine where exactly the prostate cancer is present in the prostate or if it has spread. This information may be useful in the future to help with other non-surgical therapy such as radiation beam therapy. The investigators will compare the results of the FACBC PET scan to the results of the pathology analysis of the removed prostate. In this way the investigators can determine how good a test FACBC PET is for finding out where and if prostate cancer is located in the prostate or nearby lymph nodes. The investigators will also do more advanced analysis on the biopsy samples to see if they can tell why FACBC goes into prostate cancer cells. This radiotracer has been tested in over 100 human subjects without incident. It has also been chosen by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a promising radiotracer. The NIH is funding this study.    ,NCT00917865

Prostate Cancer,Study of Metformin With Simvastatin for Men With Prostate Carcinoma, The purpose of this study is to find out whether the two drugs used in the study metformin and simvastatin can slow down the speed of rise of prostate specific antigen (PSA) or stop its rise or even bring the level down. Recently scientists noticed that men who take metformin to treat their high blood sugar or simvastatin to treat their high cholesterol are less likely to develop prostate cancer. Also scientists found that when these drugs are used in preclinical studies they can slow down the growth of the prostate cancer cells. This study will try to find out whether these drugs can actually slow down the growth of prostate cancer in men.    ,NCT01561482
Prostate Cancer,Preoperative Staging and Dose Escalated Radiotherapy of Prostate Carcinoma With PET and MRI, Prostate cancer (PCa) is currently the most common neoplastic disease among men in well-developed countries with 350 000 new cases diagnosed annually in Europe and 4 800 in Finland. Due to widespread use of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) in asymptomatic men most patients present initially with localized disease. Radical prostatectomy radiotherapy (RT) and active surveillance are the most common management options for patients with localized PCa. Proper preoperative staging for patients with adverse features on biopsy who are candidates for radical prostatectomy is urgently needed. For elderly men external beam RT is the preferred modality which can be safely performed utilizing modern techniques such as intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy (IMRT and IGRT). Since randomized studies suggest a dose response effect beyond 78-80 Gy newer techniques aim at dose escalation provided that toxicity can be controlled. Therefore ultra high dose IMRT/IGRT requires visualization of intracapsular disease which will receive the highest dose. Taken together the use of accurate anatomical and functional imaging modalities are essential for planning both nerve sparing radical prostatectomy and ultra high dose IMRT/IGRT Fluorine-18 labeled L-leucine analogue 1-amino-3-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (FACBC) has shown to preferentially accumulate in PCa and its nodal metastases. By assisting in localization of intraprostatic and pelvic disease FACBC with hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) has potential to improve selection of patients for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and IMRT/IGRT. Anatomical MRI at 1.5 Tesla (T) compared with transrectal ultrasound has demonstrated a higher sensitivity for tumor detection but almost the same specificity stressing the need for additional metabolic MRI. Advanced application of MRI such as proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (DCE-MRI) are increasingly being used for detection and characterization of PCa. The use of 3T scanners and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) consisting of anatomical MRI DWI 1H MRS and DCE-MRI demonstrated very promising result for staging and detection of PCa.    ,NCT02002455

Hydroxychloroquine may block this process from happening.    ,NCT02421575
Prostate Cancer,68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin PET/MRI in Imaging Patients With Prostate Cancer," This clinical trial studies the use of gallium-68 (68Ga)-DOTA-Bombesin positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in imaging patients with prostate cancer. PET uses a radioactive substance called 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin which attaches to tumor cells with specific receptors on their surfaces. The PET scanner takes pictures that capture where the radioactive drug is ""lighting up"" and attaching to tumor cells which may help doctors recognize differences between tumor and healthy prostate tissue. MRI uses radio waves and a magnet to make a picture of areas inside the body. Using 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin in diagnostic procedures such as PET/MRI may allow doctors to identify smaller tumors than standard imaging.    ",NCT02440308

Prostate Cancer,F-18 Sodium Fluoride in Prostate Cancer, Background: - Sodium fluoride (NaF) is a common compound that is found in various foods and can be used to increase bone strength. When this compound is added to a small dose of radiation (F-18) it collects in the bones with higher amounts in areas where the bone is rapidly changing such as the site of a healing fracture or a tumor. By giving F-18 NaF before a combined positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) scan researchers hope to be able to better measure the changes in the bone that may indicate that a certain type of cancer (such as prostate cancer) has spread to the bones. Objectives:   -  To evaluate the effectiveness of F-18 NaF in imaging studies to measure bone tumors and their change over time and compare with clinical course in individuals with prostate cancer.   -  To determine the smallest amount of change in the bone tumors that F-18 NaF can accurately measure. Eligibility: - Men at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have had imaging studies to determine whether the cancer has spread to their bones. Both patients with and without known bone involvement will be enrolled. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination medical history and imaging studies and will provide baseline blood samples to evaluate kidney function.   -  For the study participants will have two F-18 NaF PET/CT scans on separate days for baseline. These repeat scans will be used to determine the amount of change that is due to the imaging process alone (i.e. not due to the disease getting better or worse. Participants will receive a dose of F-18 NaF intravenously and will have PET/CT scanning over the body (mid ear to upper thighs) over 1 hour the body followed by a complete whole-body PET/CT scan at approximately 2 hours after F-18 NaF injection. Participants will be watched closely for side effects from the F-18 NaF until the scans are done and will be asked to drink plenty of water to void the F-18 NaF from the body after the scans.   -  As a followup study participants will have two more F-18 NaF PET/CT scans one 4 to 8 months after the first scans and then one 10 to 14 months after the first scans. Participants will provide additional blood samples before the followup scans.    ,NCT01240551

The main complication of PLND is development of a lymphocele which can cause symptoms including lower abdominal pain leg or penile/scrotal edema bladder outlet obstruction deep venous thrombosis or infection/sepsis. The incidence of radiographic (asymptomatic) and symptomatic lymphoceles following PLND varies between 126-63% and 16-33% respectively. Medicated sponges such as Tachosil® are indicated in surgery for improvement of haemostasis and to promote tissue sealing. They could reduce lymphocele development by increased tissue sealing due to a mechanical effect of the sponge itself and a lymphostatic effect of the included thrombin and fibrinogen. Our goal is to prospectively assess the lymphostatic effect of Tachosil(r) in patients undergoing transperitoneal PLND with or without radical prostatectomy or PLND with bladder cancer surgery.    ,NCT02001857

Prostate Cancer,Comparison Study of Two Different Surgical Clips During Laparoscopic Urologic Surgery, Intracorporeal suturing and knot tying during robotic prostatectomy and laparoscopic and robotic renal surgery have historically been considered the most technically challenging and time consuming aspects of these procedures. With improved operative technique as well as the use of innovative surgical devices vascular control during these surgeries is often less cumbersome as compared with traditional techniques. Current standard methods of hemostasis include the use of clips of which the most popular design is the Hemolock a locking nonabsorbable plastic clip or the use of the very expensive endomechanical stapler. Unfortunately while they are associated with time savings in the operating room there is a great deal of disposable costs associated with these various devices as well as a not insignificant device malfunction rate reported in the literature. The aim of this case-controlled study is to evaluate the Aesculap U-clip device compared to our current technique of vascular control using the Teleflex Hemolock clip device during minimally invasive genitourinary surgery.    ,NCT01008709

Prostate Cancer,To Evaluate the Technique and Effects of Separating the Prostate and Rectum With Hyaluronic Acid During Radiotherapy, The dominating problem after local radiotherapy of prostate cancer is rectal toxicity. If the rectum could be completely moved out of the treated volume a substantial decrease of rectal toxicity seems reasonable. In this study we will develop and evaluate a new transrectal injection technique where hyaluronic acid (HA) is injected in the space between the prostate and the rectum prior to external beam radiotherapy to increase the physical distance between prostate and rectum.    ,NCT01787630

Prostate Cancer,Open Anterograde Radical Prostatectomy Compared to Open Retrograde Technique, Prospective randomized study performing open anterograde anatomical radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP2A) using the same technique of minimally invasive surgery described by the Pasadena consensus for the procedure assisted by robot compared with the anatomical radical prostatectomy technique described by Patrick Walsh (RRP). Recent studies have shown benefits in the minimally invasive surgical techniques approaches laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and more recently robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). These minimally invasive techniques were associated with advantages in complications like intraoperative bleeding transfusion rates and in earlier recovery of important genitourinary functions such as urinary continence and penile erection. But still has not been demonstrated conclusively advantages as oncological control and it is believed that there are about 200 to 250 cases of learning curve so that the rates of complications and positive surgical margins become stable and similar to the open radical prostatectomy. These facts associated with the high cost of robotic technology still have limited the generalization of this approach in many developing countries such as Brazil. While the majority of studies made by comparing the radical prostatectomy (RP) robot X laparoscopic X open show a slight advantage in the first two there is a significant bias in these studies which is that the surgical technique used in each procedure differs significantly from minimally invasive and open surgical techniques. The evolution of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy was based on an entirely different anatomical benchmark of that described by Patrick Walsh. While robotics and laparoscopic techniques dissect the prostate bladder neck and the neurovascular bundle in an antegrade way from bladder neck to the apex the Walsh RRP technique is completely different in several ways the dissection is made from prostatic apex to the bladder neck so the retrograde direction the posterior layer of Denonvilliers' fascia is always included with the specimen and urethrovesical anastomosis usually performed with multifilament interrupted suture only for indicating the major differences. The RRP2A will be performed by incision (open surgery) and will be compared with the anatomical radical prostatectomy technique described by Patrick Walsh RRP and performed by the same surgeons.    ,NCT02687308

Prostate Cancer,Imaging of High Grade Prostate Cancer, Management of prostatic carcinoma varies according to stage of disease. Trans-rectal ultrasound guided biopsy is known to underestimate the degree of tumor due to undersampling and random non-targeted technique. Methods to improve pre-operative tumor localization and grading including multi-parametric (MP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an active area of research but requires further validation. High grade tumors can undergo comedo-type necrosis with malignant calcifications which only occurs in Gleason pattern 5 tumors and which we hypothesize can be reliably detected using computed tomography (CT) and/or MRI. Detection of malignant calcification within tumor foci will improve the accuracy of localization and grading in prostatic carcinoma.    ,NCT02177526

Prostate Cancer,AMG 386 and Abiraterone for Advanced Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  Advanced prostate cancer is treated with surgery or drugs that lower the levels of androgens (male hormones) in the body. However some cancers become resistant to this treatment. These types of cancers are known as castration-resistant prostate cancers.   -  Interfering with the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors can slow prostate cancer growth. AMG 386 a new anticancer drug targets the blood vessels that feed tumors. It has been tested for different types of cancer but not for prostate cancer. Researchers want to see if AMG 386 can slow disease progression in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. AMG 386 will be given with abiraterone and prednisone two drugs that are also used to treat advanced prostate cancer. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of AMG 386 with abiraterone for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Eligibility: - Men at least 18 years of age with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam medical history and imaging studies. Blood and urine samples will also be collected.   -  Participants will be separated into two groups.   -  The first group will have AMG 386 once per week for a total of four doses during a 28-day cycle. They will also take abiraterone once a day and prednisone twice a day every day of the cycle.   -  The second group will not have AMG 386. They will take abiraterone once a day and prednisone twice a day every day of the 28-day cycle.   -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.   -  Participants will continue to take the study drugs as long as the disease does not progress and there are no severe side effects.    ,NCT01553188
Prostate Cancer,Long-Term TARP Vaccination Using a Multi-Epitope TARP Peptide Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Previously Vaccinated Men on NCI 09-C-0139, Background: - Few studies or literature are available about the long-term safety of repeated peptide vaccinations in people over a period of time. Long-term vaccination may be needed to control tumors. Researchers gave a group of men a series of vaccine injections over 2 years. Now they want to give those same men the new version of the vaccine. They want to see if it produces different types of immune responses and also ensure that repeated vaccinations are safe. <TAB> Objectives: - To find out the long-term safety of repeated TARP peptide vaccinations. Eligibility: - Men who took part in NCI protocol 09-C-0139. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with blood tests scans physical exam medical history and an evaluation of how well they perform everyday activities.   -  Participants will have apheresis. Blood will be removed with a needle from one arm. A machine will separate the white blood cells. The blood minus the white cells will be returned through a needle in the other arm.   -  Participants will have 14 visits. At each visit they will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will discuss any side effects.   -  Participants will get vaccine injections at weeks 3 6 9 12 15 and 24. The vaccine will be made from the participants own cells.   -  Participants will get a Vaccine Report Card to complete after receiving vaccine.   -  The study lasts 96 weeks.    ,NCT02362464
Prostate Cancer,A Phase II Trial of Leuprolide + Flutamide + Suramin in Untreated Poor Prognosis Prostate Carcinoma, One current hypothesis as to what limits duration of initial hormone response is the rapid emergence of hormone resistant prostate carcinoma cells. Suramin has shown effectiveness as a treatment for hormonally refractory prostate carcinoma. Survival was less in patients with high rather than low circulating androgen levels. Thus suramin might slow the emergence of hormone refractory tumor cells while combined androgen ablation may maximize the effectiveness of suramin. In this trial we will pilot this concept.    ,NCT00001266

Prostate Cancer,Pd-103 Dose De-Escalation for Early Stage Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Randomized Trial, The purpose of this study is to determine the most appropriate radiation implant dose for palladium-103 monotherapy. Radiation dose is related to potential cure. From previously published studies it appears that the prescribed radiation dose can be reduced by 14-20% without any difference in potential cure (in this study the dose is being decreased 10%). Although most patients tolerate brachytherapy well complications to appear to be related to radiation exposure to normal structures (i.e. urethra rectum and proximal penis). By reducing the prescribed dose it is conceivable that fewer patients will experience side effects and complications.    ,NCT00247312
Prostate Cancer,Preop Conformal Radiotherapy - Prostate, Radical prostatectomy and radical radiation therapy remain the standard treatment approaches for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (T1 T2).Radical prostatectomy is most effective when the disease is organ confined at the time of surgery. However in many series up to 60% of patients have positive resection margins at the time of surgery and there is evidence to suggest that these patients may not be curable by surgery alone. A number of preoperative clinical variables including clinical stage serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and Gleason scorea re helpful in determining the probability of finding organ confined disease at the time of syrgery.    ,NCT00252447
Prostate Cancer,CT/MRI Co-registration Prostate Cancer, The target volume in prostate cancer radiotherapy typically consists of the entire prostate gland which is localized by contours drawn on axial computed tomography (CT) radiation planning images. Compared with CT magnetic resonance (MR) can provide better definition of the prostate gland with respect to the surrounding tissues and the use of multi-plannar reconstruction avoids the problem of partial volume averaging inherent in CT. CT has been shown to significantly overestimate the volume of the gland using the MR-defined prostate volume as the gold standard. Co-registration of MR and CT datasets matched on fixed bony landmarks has enabled radiation planning using a MR-defined clinical target volumes combined with CT-based electron density information necessary for radiation treatment planning. Rationale and Hypothesis: Co-registration may allow better delineation of tumour volumes in prostate cancer. This investigation is a fesibility study designed to evaluate and optimize imaging parameters and co-registration techniques for CT planning and MRI Simulator.    ,NCT00252460

Prostate Cancer,Study of Radioimmunoguided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) for Prostate Cancer, The current study involves a novel and aggressive therapeutic approach for patients' prostate cancer. In addition the investigators propose to administer hormonal therapy to patients with an especially high risk: those with initial Gleason scores of > 6 PSA > 10 ng/ml T3/T4 primary tumors and those found to be node positive (N+). The use of hormonal therapy in these specific settings correlates with our current standard of care. IMRT is better able to spare and protect normal tissues from receiving radiation than 3-D conformal RT. The radiotherapy would be followed by continued hormonal therapy for a total of 6 months in those who have one of the following Gleason 7 and PSA 10-20 and as per the previous version of this trial 1 year similar to that delivered by the EORTC for higher risk patients (those with initial Gleason scores of > 8 PSA > 20 ng/ml or T3/T4 tumors). Those found to be N(+) would have the hormonal therapy continued indefinitely or until disease progression occurred in a manner analogous to the Messing et. al. series in prostatectomy patients. The goals are to develop and administer a program of treatment that includes the most recent developments in imaging integrating data from both the CT scan and the ProstaScint scan to optimize prostate cancer RT. The CT scan will be used for staging and to determine the exact location of the entire prostate which will receive a reasonable dose of RT. The ProstaScint will be used to assess the spread of disease to lymph nodes as well as to determine the exact location of the tumor within the prostate gland. This region will then be boosted to a tumorcidal dose. The investigators then plan to monitor the toxicity and outcome of this treatment. The investigators expect that this program of radioimmunoguided IMRT will likely result in similar or less toxicity and increased cure rates when compared to conventional radiotherapy and standard IMRT programs.    ,NCT00956228

Prostate Cancer,Prevention of Metabolic Syndrome and Increased Weight Using Metformin Concurrent to Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, In current clinical practice an acceptable standard treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer is radiation therapy in combination with hormone therapy (called Treatment B or Group B in this study). However despite our best treatments there is a risk that the prostate cancer may eventually return. As well the hormonal therapy that is given to treat the prostate cancer is known to cause some harmful effects with some patients using the hormones gaining weight developing diabetes having increased cholesterol levels having increased blood pressure and/or heart problems. This study is looking at whether Metformin a drug that is commonly used to treat diabetes can prevent patients from developing some of the harmful effects of the hormonal therapy. In treating diabetes Metformin is known to decrease patients' sugar levels and also prevents patients from gaining weight decreases their cholesterol levels decreases the number of heart problems and allows patients to live longer. As a result the researchers in this study are hopeful that Metformin will also be beneficial for men with prostate cancer on hormonal therapy by preventing them from developing these problems.    ,NCT01996696

Prostate Cancer,Ketoconazole Plus Docetaxel to Treat Prostate Cancer, This study will determine the maximum dose of docetaxel that can be given safely in combination with ketoconazole for treating advanced prostate cancer. Docetaxel is approved for the treatment of several other types of cancers; ketoconazole is an approved antifungal medication that is also commonly used in high doses to treat prostate cancer. Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced prostate cancer that does not respond to hormone therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with blood tests to evaluate liver kidney and other organ function and with x-rays scans or other imaging tests to determine the extent of disease. Participants will take the following medications:   -  Docetaxel daily infused through a vein over 30 minutes in 4-week cycles-3 consecutive weeks of drug followed by one week of rest   -  Dexamethasone 12 hours and 1 hour before and 12 hours after docetaxel infusions to help prevent fluid retention caused by the docetaxel   -  Ketoconazole 3 times a day   -  Hydrocortisone twice a day to replace a loss of natural steroids caused by the ketoconazole Patients will be hospitalized 1 to 2 days each for the first and second doses of docetaxel to allow for frequent blood draws to measure blood levels of the drug. Ketoconazole will be started about 2 weeks after the first dose of docetaxel and the second dose of docetaxel will be given 2 days after that. In order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel the first few patients in the study will be given a low dose of the drug and subsequent patients will get increasingly higher doses until unacceptable side effects occur. Because prostate cancer cells may grow if exposed to testosterone patients may have to have their testosterone production suppressed either surgically (removal of the testicles) or medically with an injection of leuprolide or goserelin which are luteinizing hormone-release hormone agonists that reduce the amount of testosterone. Imaging studies such as x-rays bone scans or computed tomography (CT) scans will be done about every 3 months to examine how the tumor is responding to therapy. After six treatment cycles patients will have monthly chest x-rays to check for fluid around the lining of the lungs which may occur as a result of docetaxel therapy. Treatment is expected to continue for at least 3 to 6 months although this time could be shortened or extended depending on the tumor response to therapy or side effects of the drugs. Patients who do not experience bad side effects and whose tumor does not grow during the first 3 treatment cycles will continue treatment; those who experience unacceptable side effects will be taken off the study.    ,NCT00032825

Prostate Cancer,Amifostine to Protect the Rectum During External Beam Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer, This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a drug called amifostine in reducing the bowel side effects of radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Amifostine is a 'radioprotector' medicine that to protects normal tissue from radiation damage. This study will determine whether placing amifostine in the rectum during radiation treatment for prostate cancer can decrease common side effects of treatment including diarrhea painful bowel movements bleeding and gas. Patients 18 years of age or older with prostate cancer may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination blood tests bone scan if a recent one is not available and possibly computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the pelvis. They will also have a liquid retention test in which they are given an enema of 4 tablespoons of salt water that they must retain for 20 minutes. Participants will receive standard radiation therapy for prostate cancer-5 consecutive days for 8 weeks-in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Radiation Oncology Clinic. Amifostine will be placed in the rectum by a mini-enema before each radiation treatment so that it covers the lining of the rectum. To determine the side effects of the treatment patients will undergo a proctoscopic examination before beginning radiation therapy two times during therapy and at each follow-up visit for 5 years after treatment ends. This examination involves inserting a proctoscope (a thin flexible tube with a light at the end) into the rectum and taking pictures. Patients will be followed in the clinic at visits scheduled 1 3 6 12 18 24 36 48 and 60 months after treatment for a physical examination and routine blood tests proctoscopic examination and review of bowel symptoms.    ,NCT00040365

Prostate Cancer,Docetaxel Thalidomide Prednisone and Bevacizumab to Treat Metastatic Prostate Cancer, This is a Phase II study of docetaxel bevacizumab prednisone and thalidomide in patients with androgen independent metastatic prostate cancer who are previously untreated with chemotherapy. The primary objective of this study is to determine if the combination of docetaxel thalidomide and bevacizumab is able to be associated with a sufficiently high proportion of patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to be worthy of further investigation in metastatic prostate cancer. We will also be looking at multiple secondary endpoints. These will include possible pharmacokinetic interactions among the study agents potential correlation between patient genotype and efficacy of treatment. We will also be looking for circulating tumor cells in blood before and after treatment. Additionally we will be monitoring the tolerability of the regimen and survival duration as endpoints as well. We hope to use this trial to build on the promising results seen in our thalidomide/docetaxel protocol where there was a significant PSA decline and a trend toward survival benefit.    ,NCT00089609
Prostate Cancer,A Phase I Feasibility Study of an Intraprostatic PSA-Based Vaccine in Men With Prostate Cancer With Local Failure Following Radiotherapy or Cryotherapy or Clinical Progression on Androgen Deprivation Therapy in the Absence of Local Definitive Therapy, Background:   -  Pox viral vectors can induce a PSA-specific T-cell responses and clinical responses in patients with advanced prostate cancer.   -  Intratumoral vaccines of recombinant fowlpox vectors appear to be more potent in inducing antitumor effects than the s.c. route of administration especially when the recombinant rF-vector given intratumorally is preceded by a rV-recombinant given s.c. This may be due to:   -  Making the tumor cell an antigen presenting cell via upregulation of both antigen (signal 1) and costimulatory molecules (signal 2).   -  Making the tumor cell more susceptible to killing via upregulation of ICAM.   -  The increased expression of perforin in peptide-specific T cells that came into contact with the TRICOM-infected targets.   -  Potentially allowing the immune system to select for other tumor encoded antigens to generate a polyvalent immune response. Objectives:   -  1: Safety and feasibility of an intraprostatic vaccine strategy.   -  2: To assess the change in PSA-specific T-cell response as measured by ELISPOT assay.   -  2: To evaluate T-cell infiltration histologically in patients who have pre- and post-vaccine prostate biopsies. Eligibility:   -  Must have either a) biopsy proven locally recurrent prostate cancer following local radiation as defined by the ASTRO consensus criteria as 3 consecutively rising PSA levels or b) have refused or not be candidates for local definitive therapy (surgery or radiation therapy) and have clinically progressive disease on androgen deprivation therapy (eg. three increases in PSA over nadir separated by at least one week). For patients with previous RT the biopsy confirming local recurrence must be done at least 18 months after the completion of RT.   -  Since this may also generate a systemic immune response patients with minimal extraprostatic disease may be enrolled.   -  Hepatic function: Bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dl AST and ALT< 2.5 times upper limit of normal Design:   -  Dose escalation Phase I design. Each cohort will consist of 3-6 patients with cohorts 4 & 5 restricted to include only HLA-A2 + patients; maximum accrual is 30   -  Patients in all cohorts receive initial priming with rV- PSA(L155)/TRICOM and rF-GM-CSF s.c.   -  The first two cohorts utilize a booster intraprostatic with dose escalation of rF-PSA(L155)/TRICOM.   -  Third and fourth cohorts add dose escalations of rF-GM-CSF along with the highest dose of rF-PSA(L155)/TRICOM   -  Last (5th) cohort u...    ,NCT00096551
Prostate Cancer,Gene Therapy for Prostate Cancer That Returns After Radiation Therapy, The purpose of this research study is to test a new treatment for prostate cancer. We have been exploring the use of cytokine (immune stimulating) gene therapy by directly injecting a virus which produces a cytokine called interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the prostate gland to control tumor growth. We propose to explore the use of adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12 (Ad.hIL-12) in patients with recurrent non-metastatic prostate cancer following radiation therapy in a Phase I trial. Participants will be placed in rising dose groups with the primary endpoint of learning the maximum dose that can safely be given by injection directly into the prostate gland. Toxicity will be determined through physical examination laboratory values and blood levels of cytokines. Evidence of an immune response against prostate proteins will also be monitored. If the treatment works the cancer will shrink or not grow. This will be monitored by prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in the blood. However we do not know if this treatment will be effective. If the PSA continues to rise after treatment participants will be taken off study and offered other treatment. There is no compensation for participation in this research study. There will be no charge for the treatment with gene therapy or the monitoring associated with this research study. Monitoring will occur in a specially designated clinical research center.    ,NCT00110526
Prostate Cancer,Vaccine and Antibody Treatment of Prostate Cancer," This study will evaluate the side effects of a fixed dose of vaccine and GM-CSF with increasing doses of anti-CTLA-4 antibody in patients with advanced prostate cancer. The vaccine consists of a ""priming vaccine"" called PROSTVAC/TRICOM made from vaccinia virus and a ""boosting vaccine"" called PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM made from fowlpox virus. GM-CSF is a chemical that boosts the immune system and anti-CTLA-4 antibody is a protein that may improve anti-tumor activity and the response to the vaccines. DNA is inserted into the priming and boosting vaccine viruses to cause production of proteins that enhance immune activity and also to produce prostate specific antigen (PSA)-a protein that is normally produced by the patient's tumor cells. Patients 18 years of age and older with androgen-insensitive prostate cancer that has spread beyond the original site may be eligible for this 7-month study. Candidates must have disease that has worsened despite treatments with hormones and up to one chemotherapy regimen. Their tumor must produce PSA and they must have no history of allergy to eggs or egg products Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination blood and urine tests electrocardiogram pathological confirmation of the diagnosis and presence of the PSA marker chest x-rays imaging studies to assess the extent of tumor and if clinically indicated a cardiologic evaluation. Participants receive the priming vaccination on study day 1. After 2 weeks and then again every 4 weeks while on the study they receive a boosting vaccine. All vaccines are injected under the skin. On the day of each vaccination and daily for the next 3 days patients receive an injection of GM-CSF to increase the number of immune cells at the vaccination site. On the day of the first six boosting vaccinations they receive anti-CTLA-4 antibody as an infusion through a vein over 90 minutes. Patients are monitored for safety and treatment response with the following tests and procedures:   -  Blood and urine tests monthly or more often if needed to monitor liver kidney and other organ function.   -  Imaging studies to assess the tumor before starting treatment again around study days 99 and 183 and then every 3 months after that while on study.   -  Apheresis (a procedure for collecting immune cells called lymphocytes) to measure the immune response to treatment. Apheresis is done three times: before starting the study and again around study days 99 and 183. For this procedure blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components by spinning and the lymphocytes are extracted. The rest of the blood is returned to the patient through the same needle. This will only be done in participants who have the tissue marker HLA-A2 (about 50% of patients). Patients whose disease responds to treatment and who do not develop severe side effects may continue treatment beyond the initial 7-month study period on vaccine alone (without the antibody). After treatment is completed patients are monitored for up to 15 years. This includes a medical history and physical examination for 5 years following the last vaccination. Information beyond 5 years is collected once a year by telephone.    ",NCT00113984

Prostate Cancer,Normal Prostate: Oxygenation of the Prostate Gland in Men Undergoing Prostate Biopsy, This study is based on previous observation that in men with localized prostate cancer non-cancerous prostate tissue is hypoxic and on the known contribution of hypoxia to the progression of cancer. Patients undergoing diagnostic prostate biopsy with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) less than 10ng/ml and who have given informed consent will have oxygen measurements of the prostate and peri-prostatic tissue taken with the Eppendorf electrode at the time of biopsy. The oxygenation of normal prostate tissue will be compared to that of cancerous prostate tissue. In men with negative biopsies the prostate tissue oxygen measurements will be compared with the peri-prostatic tissue oxygen measurements.    ,NCT00152789
Prostate Cancer,Mobicox: Study of Meloxicam to Reduce Prostate Swelling in Permanent Seed Prostate Brachytherapy, Swelling of the prostate can occur during and after a brachytherapy. This swelling can cause urinary problems ranging from difficulty voiding to urinary retention. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Mobicox started one week before brachytherapy and then continued afterwards is more effective in reducing the risk of needing a catheter than Mobicox given only afterwards.    ,NCT00152919
Prostate Cancer,Endorectal Coil Magnetic Resonance Images (ERC-MRI), When we acquired MR images of the prostate gland using a coil (receiver antenna) inside the rectum we can see areas with tumour in the prostate gland and well as details of the anatomy. The coil inside the rectum changes the shape of the prostate gland. In order to use this images to help target radiation therapy to the tumour better we need to deform the images to the original shape of the prostate gland without the coil. In this study we will develop a way to deform the images accurately.    ,NCT00160953
Prostate Cancer,Transrectal Tumour Oxygen - US Army, Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed tumor among men in the United States. Most patients have tumors that are confined to the prostate gland at diagnosis and are suitable for treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) that is aimed at curing the disease. Nevertheless despite recent improvements in these treatments a large number of men continue to die of prostate cancer. These patients often have spread of tumor to other areas of the body and are treated with hormones that produce initial tumor shrinkage. However over time the tumor learns to grow despite continued hormonal treatment. Effective therapy for patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer is lacking and patients often deteriorate quickly and die. Thus there is a need for better treatment that cures prostate cancer at an early stage and a better understanding of the biology of prostate cancer specifically with respect to factors that determine the effectiveness of RT the spread of tumor and the development of hormone-resistant disease. Low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) are known to exist in many human tumors and studies have shown that hypoxic tumors are less likely to be cured by RT. In addition hypoxia may lead to lower cure rates following surgery spread of cancer to other areas of the body and changes in the genetic characteristics of the cancer cells that cause them to behave more aggressively. The importance of hypoxia in prostate cancer has not previously been evaluated. The aims of this study are to determine how often hypoxia occurs in early prostate cancer and whether hypoxia influences the success of RT tumor spread beyond the prostate to bones and other organs and the development of hormone-resistant disease. Patients will have tumor oxygen levels measured using a special fine-needle electrode system prior to beginning treatment with either RT or the combination of hormones plus RT. The measurements will be made through the rectum using ultrasound to position and guide the electrode. A biopsy of the tumor will be obtained at the site of the measurements and this will be used to determine how oxygen influences changes in the genetic character of prostate cancer cells. A total of 195 patients will be evaluated in this way over 3 years. This study will provide unique information about the behavior of prostate cancer which may help explain why currently available treatments including surgery RT and hormones fail to cure patients. Assuming that this study shows hypoxia to be important in prostate cancer future work will focus on new anti-hypoxia treatments to be used in combination with surgery or RT with the aim of overcoming this obstacle and improving cure rates.    ,NCT00160979
Prostate Cancer,Exisulind Versus Placebo After Surgical Removal of the Prostate, This is a study in which patients with prostate cancer treated by surgical removal of the prostate and considered to be at risk for prostate cancer recurrence will receive Exisulind 250 mg twice a day or placebo twice a day for two years.    ,NCT00166426

Prostate Cancer,Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Evaluate Prostate Cancer, This study will determine whether scanning the prostate using special magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can detect prostate cancers with greater accuracy than other methods. MRI uses a strong magnet and radio waves to produce images of body tissues. Unlike many cancers prostate cancer is difficult to see on most imaging studies like x-rays computed tomography (CT) scans and conventional MRI scans. This study will use a magnet twice as strong as the magnets commonly used in MRI tests. Patients 18 years of age and older with prostate cancer confirmed by prostate biopsy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination and review of pathology reports. Participants undergo MRI of the prostate and possibly a biopsy of the prostate gland as follows: Prostate MRI Before coming to the NIH Clinical Center for the biopsy patients take a Fleets enema to empty the rectum of fecal matter. For the MRI an endorectal coil (a tube containing a specially designed antenna) is placed in the rectum which is just behind the prostate. The coil increases the amount of signal received by the MRI unit. Additional coils may be wrapped around the pelvis to further improve the quality of the scan. The patient lies on a stretcher that moves into the scanner. A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in an arm vein for injection of a contrast agent called gadolinium which brightens the images. Patients may also be asked to breathe an oxygen-rich gas through a mask during the scan to test the use of oxygen as a contrast agent in MRI. Patients may be asked to repeat the MRI to test the reproducibility of the procedure. The repeat test is optional. Prostate Biopsy Depending on the MRI findings patients may be asked to undergo a prostate biopsy to obtain a sample of tumor tissue. The tissue is obtained with a needle placed through the rectum. Medicines may be used to reduce pain during the biopsy and to reduce the chance of infection.    ,NCT00182624
Prostate Cancer,MR-Lymphography and Lymph Node Staging in Prostate Cancer, This proposal is targeted at all patients with prostate cancer who are candidates for either curative surgery or curative radiotherapy in whom lymph node staging is indicated. Recently it has been shown that in patients with PSA <10 ng/ml and Gleason score < 7 the risk of lymph node metastases is low. Therefore unnecessary PLND and non-invasive imaging can be avoided safely in this group. PLND is nowadays performed only in patients with intermediate or high risk for nodal metastases. Thus the subgroup of patients targeted in this study consists of patients with prostate cancer with a PSA >10 ng/ml and Gleason score > 6.   -  If the high sensitivity (90%) and negative predictive value (96%) of MRL can be validated in the 8 participating centres in patients with a negative MRL invasive PLND may be avoided.   -  In patients with a positive MRL with enlarged nodes (larger than 8 mm) histological diagnosis may be obtained by imaged guided biopsy and thus also in these patients avoid PLND. A limitation of image guide biopsy however is the 30% false negative rate. [Barentsz Oyen Wolf]   -  In patients with positive small nodes (smaller than 8 mm) the urologist may focussed by the MRL findings of a positive node outside his ?surgical field-of-view??extend his dissection and thus improve his accuracy.   -  Based on the expected higher sensitivity of MRL this technique will completely replace CT-scanning.    ,NCT00185029
Prostate Cancer,Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy - Prostate Cancer, There are several different treatment schedules being used across the world for treatment of prostate cancer with radiation therapy. In order to determine the best radiation treatment for this disease a study is being performed by the doctors at the Princess Margaret Hospital. This study will try to measure the effectiveness and side effects of an increased dose of radiation to the prostate that is also given over a shorter number of weeks than is usually done. In order to try to reduce the possible side effects of the radiation therapy the treatment will be given using special techniques to shield as much of your normal body tissues as possible. This method of treatment is called conformal intensity modulated radiation therapy or IMRT.    ,NCT00188513
Prostate Cancer,Effect of Casodex on Tumour Hypoxia - Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancers in common with many other tumours are often hypoxic; that is they have low levels of oxygen. It is thought that tumour hypoxia may hasten the progression of cancers and make them more resistant to treatment. One previous study has suggested that hormone therapy such as Casodex may improve the prostate oxygen level. This study is designed to test that finding.    ,NCT00188708
Prostate Cancer,Cone Beam CT for Daily Image Guidance - Prostate Cancer, Conformal dose escalated radiation therapy (CRT) is standard treatment for patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. CRT requires accurate daily localization of the prostate prior to treatment to correct for prostate motion and set-up errors. Cone beam computed tomography (CT) can accurately localize fiducial markers within the prostate. Cone Beam CT also provides important information on daily position of organs within the pelvis. This study aims to assess the feasibility of cone beam CT for daily localization of the prostate as well as document changes in size and location of pelvic organs during an entire course of CRT.    ,NCT00188786
Prostate Cancer,Xray Volume Imaging (Cone Beam CT) - Prostate Cancer, Conformal dose escalated radiotherapy was adopted as the standard treatment technique at PMH for intermediate risk patients with localised disease in 1997. This technique provides a much smaller margin of error for treatment set-up and delivery than with conventional techniques. One way to ensure the accuracy of treatment delivery is to image the prostate position daily prior to therapy to allow for appropriate set-up corrections. To do so imaging markers are implanted into the prostate under guided ultrasound (a standard procedure at PMH). However there are disadvantages in using imaging markers which include added time to the treatment planning process and an invasive procedure with a potential for discomfort bleeding and infection. This study will investigate and compare X-ray volume imaging to the gold standard imaging markers.    ,NCT00188799
Prostate Cancer,Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Perfusion to Detect Disease in Prostate Carcinoma, This is a pilot study of 50 patients to establish whether there is a potential role for MRI perfusion in the detection of locally recurrent or persistent prostate carcinoma after previous treatment with radiotherapy. All subjects will be patients who have had localised prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and have already agreed to undergo a biopsy of the prostate to look at local control within the prostate as part of their management. The objective of the study is to establish whether there is a relationship between recurrent or persistent disease within the prostate and increased perfusion on MRI at these sites.    ,NCT00230386
Prostate Cancer,External Beam Radiation Therapy - Target Volume, Delivery of conformal radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy is limited by the inability to define the clinical target volume (CTV). This stems from a poor understanding of patterns of local recurrence and limitations of standard imaging techniques.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising modality for imaging the prostatic bed following radical prostatectomy. MRI provides more detailed postoperative anatomy to guide CTV delineation the ability to document local recurrence patterns and a method to assess intrafraction prostatic bed motion and deformity to define appropriate planning target volume margins. The aim of this pilot study is to develop a technique for external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) following radical prostatectomy based on MRI-delineation of the CTV. Twenty patients will be enrolled in this pilot development phase.    ,NCT00230438

Prostate Cancer,Erectile Dysfunction/Prostate/RT/Androgen, The optimal duration of hormonal therapy is yet to be determined in the treatment of locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate. The RTOG performed a trial of 4 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent hormones(consisting of Goserelin and Flutamide) compared to radiation alone and found that there was an improvement in local control and progression-free survival but no improvement in overall survival. The EORTC performed a similar trial but used Goserelin alone for a period of 3 years. This trial showed an improvement in local control disease-free survival and in contrast to the RTOG trial an improvement in overall survival. The rate of erectile dysfunction in men who receive a prolonged period of Gosereline (i.e. 2 yrs) is not known but suspected according to expert opinion to be significantly higher than a shorter course of hormonal ablation. Therefore the price of of a survival advantage in locally advanced prostate cancer maybe at a cost of increased rates of erectile dysfunction.    ,NCT00242138

Prostate Cancer,Collection of Blood From Patients With Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  It is not fully understood why prostate cancer in some men becomes androgen-independent (no longer responds to anti-androgen medication) but genetics likely plays an important role.   -  Genes contain the hereditary information that is passed down from parents to children. Although everyone has the same set of genes individuals can have different forms of the same gene.   -  Differences in genes may explain at least in part why some people develop a more aggressive form of prostate cancer than others. Objectives: -To obtain blood samples from patients with prostate cancer to try to identify gene differences associated with progression to the androgen independent state. Eligibility: -All patients participating in NCI prostate cancer protocols. Design:   -  Patients with prostate cancer are evaluated in the NCI s Medical Oncology Clinic.   -  Blood samples are collected at the initial visit or at follow-up visits.   -  DNA (genetic material) and white blood cells are extracted from these samples to be used for genotyping and establishment of cell lines.   -  Gene variations are correlated with prostate cancer prognosis and prognostic indicators.    ,NCT00923221

Prostate Cancer,A Pilot Study of Vaccination With Epitope-Enhanced TARP Peptide and TARP Peptide-Pulsed Dendritic Cells in the Treatment of Stage D0 Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  PSA (prostate specific antigen) is a protein found on normal and cancerous prostate cells. Levels of this protein are used to identify men who are at risk for prostate cancer and to monitor responses to treatment in men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer.   -  Research has shown that men who continue to have an elevated PSA level following primary treatment for prostate cancer are at increased risk for cancer progression. Studies have shown that the change in PSA levels over time or PSA doubling time (PSADT) can be accurate in predicting how quickly the cancer is likely to progress. Individuals with a PSADT of less than 3 months are at extremely high risk for disease progression and death from prostate cancer. Individuals with a PSADT of greater than 15 months have a very low risk of death from prostate cancer.   -  TARP is a protein that is found in about 95% of prostate cancers and is known to stimulate the immune system. The TARP prostate cancer vaccine is made from pieces of the TARP protein called peptides and includes peptides that have been modified to make them more effective at stimulating immunity. Although these TARP peptides have been shown to stimulate the immune systems of mice information is needed to determine if they also stimulate the immune system in humans. Since it is unclear what is the best way to give peptide vaccines the TARP peptides will be given with substances known to stimulate the immune system or in a vaccine made with the patient s own cells. Objectives:   -  To determine the immune system s response to vaccination with TARP peptides.   -  To determine the safety and toxicity of TARP peptide vaccination.   -  To determine if vaccination with the TARP prostate cancer vaccine can slow down PSADT in men with an intermediate PSADT of 3 to 15 months. Eligibility:   -  Males 18 years of age and older who have completed their primary treatment for prostate cancer have stage D0 disease are HLA A*0201 positive and who have a PSADT greater than 3 and less than 15 months. Design:   -  Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms:   -  Arm A will receive the TARP vaccine with other substances that stimulate the immune system.   -  Arm B will receive the TARP vaccine that includes a patient s own white blood cells.   -  First week of study after screening for eligibility has been completed:   -  Day 1: Apheresis procedure to extract white blood cells to test the immune response to the vaccine.   -  Day 3: Flu vaccine to allow researchers to determine how well a patient s immune system is working.   -  Clinic visits in Weeks 3 6 9 12 and 15 for physical examination blood samples and administration of the TARP peptide vaccine.   -  Physical examination and blood samples only in Weeks 18 and 36.   -  Additional blood samples and apheresis procedures in Weeks 24 and 48.   -  A 6th dose of TARP peptide vaccine will be administer to those patients who have a response to vaccination at week 24.   -  No follow-up or long-term study is associated with this study.    ,NCT00972309

Prostate Cancer,Vitamin C as an Anti-cancer Drug, Can high dose intravenous Vitamin C prolong life for patients with metastatic prostate cancer? Prostate cancer is the most common cancer (excluding skin cancer) in men in Denmark and the Unites States. When metastatic disease is present cure is no longer possible. The main treatment at this stage is castration either surgical or medical ending the patients testosterone production and causing a temporary regression in disease activity. Eventually the cancer will progress usually within 2 years from the castration with a more aggressive course and a survival of 2-3 years. The current treatment option for the patients who have undergone castration and have disease progression is chemotherapy with only limited gains in quality of life and survival. This clinical study is a phase 2 study to evaluate the effects of high dose intravenous vitamin c in subjects with early castration resistant prostate cancer. Primary endpoint:   -  Prostate specific antigen (PSA) changes after 12 to 20 weekly vitamin c infusions Secondary endpoints:   -  Bone metastases changes after 12 to 20 weekly vitamin c infusions   -  Changes in bone specific alkaline phosphates oxidative DNA-damage PINP NTX after 12 to 20 weekly vitamin c infusions   -  RNA-expression changes in prostatic tumor tissue after 12 to 20 weekly vitamin c infusions   -  RNA-expression changes in lymphocytes after 12 to 20 weekly vitamin c infusions Tertiary endpoints:   -  Pharmacokinetics of vitamin c in the elderly cancer patients Methods and material:   -  80 subjects are included (efficacy evaluation when 20 subjects have been evaluated for extension arm)   -  Each subject receives a weekly infusion of 60 grams vitamin c (in the form of ascorbate) for 12 to 20 weeks    ,NCT01080352

Prostate Cancer,Evaluation of Modern MRI in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in a Danish Setup, Clinical staging of prostate cancer in Denmark is determined solely by digital rectal examination and sometimes by TRUS even though the investigators know these examinations are inaccurate and have limitations. Since the majority of men diagnosed with prostate cancer will die with their disease and not of their disease and the different treatment-options may imply greater side effects it is important to improve the diagnostic localization and staging of the tumour for optimal clinical management and therapy selection. The development of modern multiparametric-high-field-magnetic-imaging (mMRI) offers new possibilities and approaches in detection localization and staging of prostate cancer due to its high resolution and soft-tissue contrast. mMRI can provide information about the morphological metabolic and cellular changes and characterize tissue- and tumour- vascularity and correlate it with tumour aggressiveness. This helps to locate and stage a possible tumour and to guide targeted-biopsies towards disease-suspicious areas. Internationally published data support the rapidly growing use of multiparametric MRI as being the most sensitive and specific imaging tool for prostate cancer patients. While mMRI internationally is a well recognized and accepted method for detection localization and staging of prostate cancer the use of mMRI in the diagnosis of PCa in Denmark has never been applied. Therefore this project is carried out in order to evaluate the use of modern mMRI in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in a Danish setup.    ,NCT01640262

Prostate Cancer,Health Effects of Soccer Training in Men With Prostate Cancer Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy, Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is standard treatment for locally advanced or advanced Prostate Cancer (PC). The musculoskeletal toxicity associated with ADT is well established leading to a decrease in muscle mass increased fat percentage weight gain sexual dysfunction and increased risk of depression fatigue diabetes cardiovascular disease and reduced quality of life. Numerous studies have shown an association between physical activity physical capacity and quality of life in cancer patients and recent epidemiological research suggest that regular moderate-intensity physical activity may have a positive effect on survival in men with prostate cancer. Within exercise physiology there is new evidence pointing to recreational soccer as a unique form of intermittent exercise that effectively stimulates aerobic and anaerobic energy delivery systems leading to beneficial musculoskeletal metabolic and cardiovascular adaptations of importance for health. It is our overall hypothesis that 12 weeks of recreational soccer training 2-3 times per week will improve the health profile of PC patients receiving ADT treatment.    ,NCT01711892

Prostate Cancer,Metformin-Docetaxel Association in Metastatic Hormone-refractory Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in men representing 10 deaths about of 100 cancers (INVS 2009). Treatment for metastatic prostate cancer when becoming resistant to hormone-treatment is mostly resumed to a relatively ineffective chemotherapy (Docetaxel/TAXOTERE®) (1). Recently numerous clinical and preclinical works showed that Metformin could represent an excellent candidate for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. This is a widely prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes with clinical advantage of exhibiting very rare serious side effects. On the other hand the use of this molecule in patients was associated with a decrease of tumors incidence in particular prostate cancer (2). Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies support its role as an anti-cancer drug in several cell lines (3). These experimental results are consistent with a clinical trial pilot study performed in colorectal cancer showing anti proliferative effect of Metformin (4). In the field of prostate F. Bost in J.F. Tanti's team (INSERM U895 Nice) demonstrated that Metformin inhibits cell viability of human prostate cancer cells via mTOR downregulation and decrease tumor growth in a xenograft model (5). Furthermore preclinical data performed by this team showed that Metformin increased significantly apoptosis induced by TAXOTERE®. Therefore by targeting specifically cancer cell metabolism Metformin offers new promising therapeutic strategy. The primary objective of this randomized study is to evaluate the biological efficacy of Metformin combination with TAXOTERE® in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. To achieve this purpose PSA response rate will be evaluated according to ASTRO definitions (Bubley Carducci et al. 1999). Concurrently secondary endpoints will be under investigation in order to evaluate the clinical response according to RECIST criteria the overall and free-progression survival and the quality of life. Toxicity assessment will also be performed regarding to this drug combination. Considering the well tolerability of Metformin and the first clinical and pre-clinical data reports of it use in cancer treatment combining Docetaxel (TAXOTERE®) with Metformin may represent a promising strategy for treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.    ,NCT01796028
Prostate Cancer,Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the most common solid organ cancer among men and is the second leading cause of cancer death. In 2013 about 238590 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 29720 men will die of the cancer. Overall about 1 in 6 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime but only 1 in 36 men will die. Currently there are over 2.5 million men in the US living with prostate cancer. Standard treatment for prostate cancer has involved either removal of the prostate (radical prostatectomy) or application of some type of energy to the entire prostate gland in order to kill all of the cells--usually with radiation or cryotherapy (freezing). Over the past decade it has become apparent that while some men will benefit from treatment for prostate cancer many will not. Particularly for men with a small amount of low-grade (not very aggressive) type of prostate cancer the risk of death from this very slow-growing cancer is very low. However the risk of harm from some of the treatments for prostate cancer is very high. Treatment for prostate cancer can cause erectile dysfunction urinary leakage difficulty urinating and overactive bladder and bowel symptoms. One strategy for men with low risk prostate cancer has been to avoid immediate treatment and wait until the cancer starts to grow. The risk of this strategy is that some men may not be able to be cured once the cancer starts to grow. In addition men who are on this active surveillance protocol can become very nervous fearing that the cancer will start to spread. A new strategy to avoid some of the treatment harms of prostate cancer while also attempting to avoid allowing the cancer to grow is called focal therapy. Many men with low-risk prostate cancer will have only a small piece of cancer within the prostate gland. These men may benefit from treating only this one area instead of the entire prostate. This will allow the physician to kill the cancer cells and to avoid some of the problems associated with treating the entire prostate. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of focal targeted treatment of prostate cancer that is to treat only the small area of cancer instead of the entire prostate. We hope to show that this strategy will reduce the amount of side effects without compromising cancer cure.    ,NCT01802307

Prostate Cancer,Imaging Studies to Check the Local Response of Prostate Cancer to Radiation Therapy, Background: - Radiation is a common treatment for prostate cancer. It helps damage tumor cells and causes them to die. Radiation can be effective but some tumors may be harder to treat with radiation or even with surgery. This happens to a small number of men who have either radiation or surgery for prostate cancer. Most men who have these hard-to-treat tumors do not know if the tumor has recurred only in the prostate or has spread to another area. Also men whose prostate cancer has recurred only after radiation may have different treatment options. This study will use improved imaging studies to better understand why some men do not respond as well to initial radiation treatments. Objectives: - To use detailed imaging studies to look at the results of local radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Eligibility:   -  Men at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have radiation for prostate cancer.   -  Men at least 18 years of age whose prostate cancer has returned after earlier treatments. Design:   -  All participants will have a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be used to evaluate the cancer at the start of the study.   -  All participants will have an initial full magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate. Tumor and healthy tissue samples will be collected.   -  Those whose cancer has recurred after treatment will discuss possible treatment options with the study doctors.   -  Participants who are scheduled to have radiation will have radiation therapy. This will be given according to the current standard of treatment.   -  After radiation participants will have regular follow-up tests and imaging studies. They will have another full MRI scan 6 months after the end of radiation treatment.    ,NCT01834001

Prostate Cancer,Outpatient Radical Prostatectomy - Surgical and Anesthetic Considerations, Radical prostatectomy has become the gold standard treatment for prostate cancer. Regarding of morbidity of access on open retropubic radical prostatectomy a lot of centers around the world start to develop laparoscopic and robotic approach over the past years. The problems regarding this techniques is that the pure laparoscopic prostatectomy shows a steep learning curve with a high initial complication rate and the use of robotic assistance surgery despite of lower learning curve is associated with higher surgical supply and operative room costs. These costs may have a significant impact on overall cost of prostate cancer care especially in Brazil. In Brazil the open route for radical prostatectomy is still the most frequent approach. One of the disadvantages of open prostatectomy from the other surgeries is the longest hospital stay. However the question of what length of stay after this operation is optimal and necessary is unresolved. In this trial the investigators have compared a randomized group of patients that had discharged on postoperative day 2 1 and same day surgery. The investigators had intent to evaluate the feasibility of ambulatory open radical prostatectomy (patient discharge in the same day of surgery - average 12 hours of hospitalization) maintaining patient satisfaction and safety.    ,NCT01955863

Prostate Cancer,Functional MR-guided Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy of Prostate Cancer, To improve radiation therapy of prostate cancer the investigators must be able to accurately identify the tumour. By using advanced functional imaging techniques available on state-of-the-art MRI scanners to clearly show the specific location of the tumour inside the prostate the investigators can use advanced radiation therapy techniques to specifically target the tumor and control it with as few radiotherapy clinic visits as possible. This is different than current techniques which treat the whole prostate gland to the same dose delivered over 7-8 weeks of daily radiotherapy visits. By increasing the radiation dose to the active tumor while still maintaining adequate radiation dose to the rest of the prostate the investigators hope to better control prostate cancer and reduce complications to nearby normal tissues.    ,NCT01976962

Prostate Cancer,A Study for Patients With Prostate Cancer to See Whether Delivering an Extra Dose of Radiation to Parts of the Body With More Cancer is Better Than Standard Treatment in Which the Same Dose of Radiation is Given Throughout the Prostate Gland, Patients with localized prostate cancer are routinely treated with radiation therapy to the entire prostate gland. The investigators can identify where the cancer is concentrated in the prostate gland using a newer specialized imaging technique called 11C Choline PET (stands for choline positron emission tomography). This is different from the older type of PET scan that has been used in the past (called FDG PET) which has not been as accurate as the new PET scan for identifying where the cancer is in the prostate gland. It has also been shown that delivering higher doses of radiation to prostate cancer cells in the prostate have resulted in better cure rates in patients with prostate cancer. Therefore for goal number one the investigators want to give higher radiation dose to the prostate cancer cells. But the challenge has been that delivering higher doses of radiation to the prostate gland may also increase the chance of complications from the higher doses of radiation to the rectum bladder and surrounding area. Therefore for goal number two the investigators want to minimize radiation dose to the rectum bladder and surrounding area. 3-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T MRI) is a new kink of scan that will be used in this study to identify the urethra in the prostate so that the investigators can minimize the radiation dose to the urethra. The investigators believe the 3T MRI scan is able to point to the areas of cancer that may be able to predict how well the treatments may work as well as which areas of the tumor appear to be responding to failing. In this study the investigators will keep the dose of radiation to the rectum and bladder as low as possible while increasing radiation dose to parts of the prostate with more cancer cells. The investigators will compare the cure rates in this study with the cure rates of other patients receiving the standard treatment in which the same dose of radiation is delivered throughout the prostate gland. The investigators will also compare the rates of complications in this study with the rates of complications in patients receiving the standard treatment in which the same dose of radiation is delivered throughout the prostate gland.    ,NCT02004418

Subjects will be randomized to one of 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:1 fashion: a standard regimen of radium-223 dichloride of 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) injections every month for 6 months a high dose regimen of 80 kBq/kg (88 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update)injections every month for 6 months or an extended duration regimen of 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) injections every month for 12 months. Following the treatment phase subjects will be followed up every 12 weeks for a minimum of 2 years at which point they will enter a long term follow-up period during which they are seen every 6 months for up to 7 years after the last dose of radium dichloride. Symptomatic skeletal event and safety endpoints will be assessed at each clinic visit. Pain and analgesic use data will be collected every 4 weeks through Week 48. Additionally radiological assessments including MRI/CT of the abdomen and pelvis and chest CT as well as technetium-99 bone scans will be performed at Weeks 8 16 and 24 and continue every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression is documented in either the bone or in soft tissue. Radiological imaging will be evaluated by blinded central review.    ,NCT02023697
Prostate Cancer,A Randomized Phase IIa Efficacy and Safety Study of Radium-223 Dichloride With Abiraterone Acetate or Enzalutamide in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), The primary objective in this study is to evaluate bone scan response at Week 24 based on the quantified technetium-99 bone scan lesion area (BSLA). The safety of radium-223 dichloride in combination with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide will be investigated. The study will evaluate radiological progression free survival overall survival and skeletal events. This study will also explore the clinical utility of different imaging modalities (whole body quantified technetium-99 bone scan DW-MRI and NaF PET-CT scan) and will have a separate central radiological review for applicable secondary and exploratory imaging endpoints. All subjects will be randomized as assigned randomly by the IXRS system in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of the treatment arms: radium-223 dichloride alone 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) every 4 weeks for up to 6 doses; radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) every 4 weeks up to 6 doses together with abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg bid; radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) every 4 weeks up to 6 doses together with enzalutamide 160 mg daily.The study will consist of screening treatment and follow-up periods. Study will continue until disease progression as determined by investigator or when patient meets criteria for withdrawal from study. Subjects in treatment arms with abiraterone/prednisone or enzalutamide will have the option to continue taking oral study therapy until the end of the study (2 years from the last dose of radium-223 dichloride) if the investigator deems the subject may benefit and there is no clinical or radiological progression. Subjects who discontinue all study treatment prior to 2 years from last radium-223 dichloride treatment will enter active follow-up. During the active follow-up period the subject will have a safety visit at the clinic every 12 weeks from the EOT for up to 2 years from the last dose of radium-223 dichloride. Beyond 2 years from last radium-223 dichloride treatmentsubjects will enter long-term follow-up and will be followed via phone contact at intervals to assess for safety (hematological toxicity and new primary malignancies) and overall survival. A separate long-term safety follow-up study protocol is planned. Once implemented the study subjects surviving after the end of the active follow-up will be transitioned to this separate long-term safety follow-up protocol.    ,NCT02034552
Prostate Cancer,Improving Adherence to Oral Cancer Agents and Self Care of Symptoms Using an IVR, Improving Adherence to Oral Cancer Agents and Self Care of Symptoms Using an IVR The goals of this study are to improve adherence to oral chemotherapeutic medications and self-management of symptoms among cancer patients. More than 40 oral agents currently are on the market with projections that in three years 30% of the cancer treatment agents will be delivered in oral form. As a result patients must assume responsibility for taking medications and self-management of associated side effects. This longitudinal randomized trial tests and compares 'two strategies' for improving patient adherence to their oral cancer medication prescriptions to standard care. Both strategies incorporate symptom management support using an interactive voice response system (IVR) for symptom assessment and a printed evidence-based Medication Management and Symptom Management Toolkit (Toolkit) with helpful strategies and information for symptom management. We will collaborate with NCI Comprehensive Cancer Centers to recruit patients into this study. Recruiters will identify patients as they are prescribed oral cancer medications present the study to the patient and ask them to consent to be part of the study. Study Aims Following are the Aims of the study.   1. Cancer patients assigned to the intervention will have greater adherence to their prescribed regimen: a) at week 4 (immediate effect) and b) at weeks 8 and 12 (sustained effect).   2. When compared with patients receiving weekly assessments only patients receiving weekly assessments plus daily adherence reminders and printed symptom management strategies for 4 weeks will report: lower symptom severity during weeks 2-4 that will be sustained at weeks 5-8 and at 12 weeks. Two exploratory aims are assessed:   1. To test how patient characteristics (age sex depression) dose variation symptom severity and concurrent infusion therapy moderate the impact of the novel intervention on adherence at 4 8 and 12 weeks.   2. To test the impact of the novel intervention on dose alterations emergency department visits and hospital admissions over the 12 weeks in order to support the translation of this system into oncology practices.    ,NCT02043184

The study will include 32 men with high-risk prostate cancer who are eligible for radical prostatectomy. Informed consent is a requirement for inclusion in the study.    ,NCT02076503
Prostate Cancer,Multi-Center Trial of High-resolution Transrectal Ultrasound Versus Standard Low-resolution Transrectal Ultrasound for the Identification of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer, This trial uses a ultra high-resolution ultrasound system and specialized transducer intended for use in prostate imaging. The system's image resolution is significantly better than the standard of care due to its higher frequency. This allows the system to visualize suspicious areas and structures and for greater accuracy for guided biopsy. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that ultra high-resolution transrectal ultrasound (UHR-TRUS) is superior to conventional low-resolution transrectal ultrasound (LR-TRUS) in detecting clinically significant cancer among men without known prostate cancer and with an indication for prostate biopsy. The secondary objective of this study is to compare the difference in the rate of detection of clinically significant cancer between LR-TRUS and UHR-TRUS from before investigator training to after investigator training. The tertiary objective for the investigation is to compare the combined sensitivity and specificity in determining cancer detection overall for image-guided biopsy in UHR-TRUS vs. LR-TRUS.    ,NCT02079025
Prostate Cancer,Surgery Versus Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer, This prospective open randomized phase III surgical trial seeks to study whether radical prostatectomy (with or without the combination of external radiation) improves prostate-cancer specific survival in comparison with primary radiation treatment and hormonal treatment among patients diagnosed with locally advanced (T3) prostate cancer. Untreated or conservatively treated locally advanced prostate cancer is associated with high mortality. Modern curative treatment for advanced solid malign tumors include surgery and/or radiation plus attempted chemotherapy if available to achieve both local control and elimination of potential micro metastases. Whereas there is evidence that surgery can cure localized prostate cancer there are no clinical trials of multi-modal treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer that includes surgical removal of the prostate. One potential advantage of adding prostatectomy to the treatment of LAPC is that removing the prostate enables a full pathological assessment of the tumor characteristics and thus a better estimation of the risk of recurrence. Surgical treatment could thus reduce the numbers needed to treat with chemotherapy and radiation and thus improve quality of life after treatment. In addition evidence indicate that residual cancer in the prostate occurs in 25% after radiation treatment (56)and surgical removal of the prostate may improve survival beyond what can be achieved by radiation and ADT. On the other hand patients treated with surgery radiation and hormones will experience side effects of all three treatment modalities and might fare better if radiotherapy plus hormones can provide oncological control without prior surgery. A randomized clinical trial comparing two multimodal treatment regimens of which one includes a radical prostatectomy is therefore warranted.    ,NCT02102477

Prostate Cancer,18F-DCFBC PET/CT in Prostate Cancer, Background: - Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. A chemical called a radiotracer helps doctors get images of this type of cancer. Researchers want to test a radiotracer called 18F-DCFBC. Objective: - To see if the radiotracer 18F-DCFBC can identify sites of prostate cancer in the body. Eligibility: - Men ages 18 and over with prostate cancer. The cancer must be newly diagnosed have relapsed or has spread outside the prostate. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with physical exam and medical history. They will give a blood sample.   -  Participants will be divided into three groups. Group 1: people with cancer only in the prostate scheduled for surgical prostate removal or biopsy at NIH. Group 2: people who had their prostate removed or had radiation therapy and now have a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) without other signs of disease. Group 3: people whose cancer has spread to other areas of the body.   -  Participants will have 18F-DCFBC injected into a vein then imaged in a PET/CT camera. During the scans they will lie on their back on the scanner table.   -  Group 1 will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A tube will be placed in the rectum. Coils may be wrapped around the outside of the pelvis. Participants will have a contrast agent injected through an intravenous line.   -  Group 3 will have another PET/CT scan with a different radiotracer 18F NaF within 21 days of the 18F-DCFBC scan to look for prostate cancer in the bone.   -  Group 3 will repeat the two PET/CT scans 4-6 months after the initial scans.   -  A few days after each scan participants will be contacted for follow-up.    ,NCT02190279

Prostate Cancer,MRI / Ultrasound Fusion With Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Guidance, Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. It is most often detected by an abnormal digital rectal exam or an elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen -determine by a blood test. When it is suspected that someone may have prostate cancer a biopsy is ordered. This biopsy is performed by the Radiologist with ultrasound guidance through the rectum. In some patients a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate may be ordered to further evaluate the prostate. In some situations the MRI and Ultrasound images will be fused (digitally merged) together during the ultrasound procedure to help localize the questionable lesions. Recent research has used an additional component known as a contrast agent - an intravenously injected inert substance - which is identifiable by ultrasound. This inert substance is more obvious in areas of increased blood flow which is a common finding in cancerous lesions. In this research project we would like to determine whether the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound is beneficial in improving accuracy of the biopsies taken and the relative correlation to the MRI/ Ultrasound-fused images.    ,NCT02233725
Prostate Cancer,Safety Efficacy and Pharmacokinetic Behavior of Leuprolide Mesylate in Subjects With Advanced Prostate Carcinoma, The study will evaluate if Leuprolide Mesylate is safe and effective in the treatment of subjects with advanced prostate carcinoma when administered as two injections six months apart.    ,NCT02234115
Prostate Cancer,Contrast Enhanced MRI of the Prostate, Prostate cancer detection and disease progression monitoring relies on systematic multi-core biopsies. Minimal invasive imaging capacities for lesion targeting and monitoring are badly needed. The purpose of this study is to determine if a new MRI technique can identify prostate lesions or to monitor prostate disease progression. If so biopsy core number can be reduced to as small as one and frequency for biopsy repeat can be reduced. The new technique is about a new way of analyzing the pictures taken as part of prostate MRI exam. This part is called dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. It involves an injection of contrast reagent (or dye) through the arm vein during a time period when prostate MRI pictures are continuously taken.    ,NCT02245282

Prostate Cancer,Interest of Indocyanine Green in Neoplastic Prostatic Tissue, Prostate cancer with more than 70000 new cases and 8900 deaths a year in France is a major public health problem. Until 28% of patients treated with surgery will present a positive surgical margin resulting in an incomplete clearance of the tumoral process and exposing so the patient at a local systemic recurrence and increased morbidity. An increasing number of international publications have shown (ICG) was interesting for the detection of the sentinel lymph node in the surgery of tumors of type hepatocarcinoma and liver metastases from colorectal diseases but also in the surgery of the kidney bladder or breast. ICG has affinity for tumor and tissues around the tumor related to micro-vascular histology for a localized and specific deposit (EPR effect). The detection of ICG 's deposits is now possible with to the use of a device which allow to visualize the infra-red fluorescence (NIR; Near Infra-Red) for objects larger than 0.15 mm. Thanks to this feature the location of residual tumor tissue when performing a radical prostatectomy could be made much easier.    ,NCT02260349
Prostate Cancer,Single Fraction HDR Brachytherapy Plus Hypofractionated EBRT for Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Phase II Trial, The hypofractionated external radiation (EBRT) is a technique that radiation dose delivery using higher daily fractions than those used routinely. In this way can cause more damage tumor especially in tissues that have a slower proliferation rate as in the case of prostate cancer. Furthermore achieves a reduction in total treatment time and probably a lesser chance of development of collateral in tissues of high multiplication rate as the lining of the rectum and bladder effects. With brachytherapy boost for high dose rate is achieved by administering a more intense dose on the tumor and lower the sound around the region to be treated tissues improving the therapeutic window. Treatment with retracted and fully ambulatory time has potential benefit as early patient return to usual activities and optimizing the flow of patients who require treatment with radiotherapy. This prospective study aims to assess the results and the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen retracted.    ,NCT02283346

Prostate Cancer,SmartTarget THERAPY, The purpose of this study is to assess how accurately SmartTarget can direct high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to a pre-defined area (cancer) in the prostate. The current standard methods for treating prostate cancer are directed to the whole gland - either surgery to remove it or radiotherapy. An alternative method is focal therapy. This is surgery that uses an energy source to ablate the cancer whilst preserving the normal healthy tissue. Prior to surgery prostate cancer can often be localised using MRI imaging and detailed prostate biopsy techniques. The difficulty is that during surgery it is very difficult to accurately locate the cancer on the live ultrasound images - to compensate surgeons will treat half or a quarter of the prostate to ensure that the cancer is treated. This may cause higher rates of side-effects. SmartTarget is an MRI to ultrasound fusion device that maps the pre-treatment MRI onto the live ultrasound during surgery. It then provides a target for the surgeons to treat during the operation. The results will measure if the area intended to treat was covered and if how accurate the treatment was by comparing the pre-treatment MRI with a 1 week post treatment scan    ,NCT02290561

Prostate Cancer,SmartTarget: BIOPSY," The purpose of this study is to determine how well SmartTarget guided prostate biopsies perform compared with our current standard of ""visually directed biopsies"" in the detection of prostate cancer. The diagnosis of prostate cancer is dependent upon sampling the prostate to confirm disease. Standard trans-rectal biopsies are taken in a random fashion without prior knowledge of the disease location. Transperineal mapping biopsies overcome this by systematically samples the entire gland but are very intensive and time consuming to perform. An alternative method is to perform targeted prostate biopsies where an MRI prior to biopsy can be used to inform doctors about the location of the disease. This is a difficult procedure to perform as it requires the surgeon to mentally translate the location of disease on MRI image to the live ultrasound seen in theatre. SmartTarget may help this procedure by providing guidance to the location of the disease by fusing the MRI image onto the live ultrasound thereby providing the clinician a target to biopsy. This trial will compare the outcomes of ""visually directed biopsies"" with those directed by SmartTarget    ",NCT02341677
Prostate Cancer,Feasibility Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for Localized Prostate Cancer: Cyberknife vs. VMAT, Recent studies support the use of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for the treatment of localized prostate cancer (PrCa). SBRT is a way to deliver radiation very precisely allowing higher doses to be delivered with fewer treatments potentially improving patient outcomes. Cyberknife and Volume Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) are accepted SBRT techniques. However the effects of the specific SBRT treatment technique on patient outcomes have not been evaluated in randomized trials. Although such a trial would be of great interest patients' willingness to participate is unclear. Multiple patient and clinician factors contribute to the decision to enter a randomized trial. This feasibility study will evaluate patients' willingness to participate in a trial comparing Cyberknife and VMAT SBRT for the treatment of early stage PrCa. Patients accepting enrolment will be randomized to one of the two types of SBRT delivery. Up to 66 patients will be approached and up to 40 randomized. A questionnaire will help to identify the factors influencing the patient's decision to participate or not. This study will gather information on feasibility PSA control patient outcomes and side effects and will inform the design of a future randomized phase II/III study.    ,NCT02344667
Prostate Cancer,Multi-Epitope TARP Peptide Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Men With Stage D0 Prostate Cancer, Background: - Men who continue to have an elevated or rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) level after their primary prostate cancer treatment are at increased risk for their cancer to progress. The time it takes to progress is highly variable. One way to predict this progression is based on the change in PSA levels over time. This is called the PSA doubling time (PSADT). Researchers want to test a vaccine on men with Stage D0 prostate cancer. Stage D0 means the PSA has become detectable again or has started to rise after primary treatment but has not spread to other organs. Objectives: - To test a vaccine s effectiveness on the rate of PSA increase using PSADT and tumor growth rates. Eligibility: - Men with Stage D0 prostate cancer with a PSADT between 3 and 15 months. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with blood tests scans physical exam and medical history. Their prostate cancer will be confirmed.   -  Participants will undergo apheresis. Blood will be removed with a needle from one arm. A machine will separate the white blood cells. The blood minus the white cells will be returned through a needle in the other arm.   -  Participants will have 14 visits. At each visit they will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will discuss any side effects.   -  Participants will get injections of either the vaccine or placebo at weeks 3 6 9 12 15 and 24. Both will be made from the participants own cells.   -  Participants will be selected randomly to receive either active vaccine or placebo. For every two participants assigned to active vaccine one participant will be assigned to placebo vaccine.   -  Participants will get a Vaccine Report Card to to complete after receiving vaccine.   -  The study lasts 96 weeks.    ,NCT02362451

Prostate Cancer,Preservation of Endopelvic Fascia: Effects on Postoperative Incontinence and Impotence. Randomized Clinical Trial., Urinary incontinence and impotence are typical disturbances after radical prostatectomy. Although several surgical methods are developed to decrease these disturbances 8% and 50% of the patients suffer from permanent urinary incontinence and impotence respectively. Previously two studies have shown that endopelvic fascia preservation may decrease postoperative incontinence and impotence rates. Unfortunately these studies are retrospective decreasing their reliability. The present study is prospective and randomized clinical trial. The investigators are going to randomize 180 patient to preservation and opening the endopelvic fascia groups. Functional and oncological results are followed up to 1 year after surgery.    ,NCT02526602

Prostate Cancer,Tumor Hypoxia With HX4 PET in Several Diseases, Regulation of tissue oxygen homeostasis is critical for cell function proliferation and survival. Evidence for this continues to accumulate along with our understanding of the complex oxygen-sensing pathways present within cells. Several pathophysiological disorders are associated with a loss in oxygen homeostasis including heart disease stroke and cancer. The microenvironment of tumors in particular is very oxygen heterogeneous with hypoxic areas which may explain our difficulty treating cancer effectively. Prostate carcinomas are known to be hypoxic. Increasing levels of hypoxia within prostatic tissue is related to increasing clinical stage patient age and a more aggressive prostate cancer. Several researches indicated that hypoxia might also play a role in esophageal cancer. In glial brain tumors hypoxia is correlated with more rapid tumor recurrence and the hypoxic burden in newly diagnosed glioblastomas is linked to the biological aggressiveness. In brain metastases CA-IX expression (a marker for hypoxia) is correlated to the primary non-small cell lung carcinomas. Hypoxia enhances proliferation angiogenesis metastasis chemoresistance and radioresistance of hepatocellular carcinoma. The hypoxic markers HIF-1α VEGF CA-IX and GLUT-1 were all over expressed in colorectal cancer and its liver metastases. Based on literature hypoxia in tumors originating or disseminated to prostate esophagus brain and rectum cancer will be studied in this trial.    ,NCT02584400

Prostate Cancer,Cabazitaxel in mCRPC Patients With AR-V7 Positive CTCs, After failure on docetaxel which has been the standard first line therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) several treatment options are currently available. In retrospective studies resistance has been described to two of the treatment options enzalutamide and abiraterone when a splice variant of the Androgen Receptor (AR-V7) is present on circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The investigators hypothesize that patients with AR-V7 positive CTCs do have a meaningful response to cabazitaxel.    ,NCT02621190
Prostate Cancer,Treatment With Sandostatin in Patients With Castrate Resistance Prostate Cancer Showing Uptake of 68Ga-DOTATET, Purpose: Castrate resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) often shows histological evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). Recently the investigators initiated a research project investigating the uptake of the radiotracer 68Ga-DOTATET (a marker of neuroendocrine tumors-NET) in PET/CT in patients with CRPC. In 4/8 patients studied thus far uptake of the tracer in bone metastases was found. It has been shown that monthly injections of Somatostatin lengthen overall survival in patients with NET. The purpose of the current project is to examine the ability of Somatostatin to stabilize or possibly reverse metastases in patients with CRPC that express high level of somatostatin receptors in 68Ga-DOTATET PET/CT. Materials and Methods: 30 patients with CRPC will be studied with 68Ga-DOTATET PET/CT. Patients showing uptake of the radiotracer 68Ga-DOTATET in at two least to metastases will be considered eligible for the study. These patients will be evaluated biochemically and clinically and will be treated with monthly injections of Sandoatatin LAR - 30mg. Clinical biochemical and imaging studies (68Ga-DOTATET PET/CT) will be repeated after 4 and 12 months of treatment. Responding patients (stabilization or decrease in the number and SUV of metastases) will be subjected to continued therapy until progression.    ,NCT02631616

Prostate Cancer,Hemi-Ablative Prostate Brachytherapy," This clinical study will evaluate side effects quality of life and cancer control in patients with prostate cancer diagnosed on only one side of the prostate gland. The diagnosis of unilateral prostate cancer will be made by means of a prostate transperineal template biopsy (TTB) and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Patients will be treated with low dose rate brachytherapy using permanent iodine seed implants.Treatment will be limited to the side of the gland where the cancer has been diagnosed and is therefore called ""focal"" brachytherapy. Prostate brachytherapy is usually applied to the whole prostate gland. After whole gland prostate brachytherapy urinary bowel and sexual function may be affected. In this focal approach the side effects will be evaluated by means of patient questionnaires.These will be repeated at various intervals after treatment.The results will be compared to the same questionnaires responded by patients who have undergone whole gland brachytherapy.Therefore an assessment can be made whether focal therapy produces fewer side effects than whole gland brachytherapy.The observation period will last for two years after treatment. A biopsy and mpMRI will be repeated after two years to evaluate prostate cancer control.    ",NCT02632669
Prostate Cancer,Multiparametric MRI for Prostate Cancer Localization and Characterization Using Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection, Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among men in the United States and Canada. Suspicion of prostate cancer with modern screening tests such as digital rectal exam (DRE) and prostate serum antigen (PSA) require ultrasound-guided biopsy for pathological diagnosis. However this technique misses cancer in nearly one quarter of patients and finds clinically insignificant disease in another third of patients resulting in over-treatment and unnecessary morbidity. MRI is the best imaging method for prostate cancer detection but current techniques cannot reliably predict tumour grade and are often unreliable for localizing cancer particularly within the transition zone where specificity is low. The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the added benefit of localizing prostate cancer and predicting tumour grade with Hyperpolarized 13C MRI in addition to traditional T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The investigators propose a pilot study in men diagnosed with prostate cancer awaiting prostatectomy with the specific goals of comparing pre-operative imaging findings to ground truth histology using whole-mount prostate specimens. The results of this study will provide insight into the prostate cancer disease signatures with MRI and determine if there is added benefit for incorporation of this new technique into future clinical MRI protocols. If future imaging tests could determine the size grade and extent of disease this would open the door for less invasive localized treatment options with reduced morbidity.    ,NCT02647983
Prostate Cancer,Hypofractionated Intensity Modulated and Image Guided Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer, Hypofractionated intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy (HypoIGRT) with fewer high-fraction-size treatments would be beneficial for prostate cancer because it would deliver a larger biological-equivalent dose to the tumor than would conventional treatment in 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions while maintaining a similar or lower incidence of late normal tissue reactions. Thus the investigators aim to assess the hypothesis that HypoIGRT treatment for localized prostate cancer will improve the therapeutic ratio by either:   1. Reducing normal tissue mainly genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity and / or   2. Improving tumour control mainly freedom from biochemical failure survival.    ,NCT02651896
Prostate Cancer,Engaging Newly Diagnosed Men About Cancer Treatment Options," This research is being done to better understand how a new lab test called the Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay may impact what treatment men decide to get and how they feel and think about their choice of treatment. The study will compare men who receive this new lab test with men who receive the usual counseling given to men after they get a new diagnosis of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is sometimes slow-growing and sometimes fast-growing. Healthcare providers are searching for better ways to predict how each tumor will behave so that each man can make a better decision about when to receive treatment. The Oncotype DX lab test uses leftover prostate biopsy tissue to generate a Genomic Prostate Score (GPS). The GPS is related to the risk of a fast-growing cancer being discovered if surgery is performed to remove a man's prostate. The goal of this study is to find out if this test helps men when they are deciding how their prostate cancer will be treated. Treatment options include surgery to remove the prostate radiation therapy or an approach called ""active surveillance"" in which there is no immediate therapy and the tumor is watched using prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests and repeat biopsies.

Prostate Cancer,Oral Docetaxel (ModraDoc/r) in Combination With Hormonal Treatment and Radiation Therapy in High-risk Prostate Cancer, The optimal treatment for HRPC patients has not yet been established. Recent trials suggest a benefit from early treatment with docetaxel in the castration-sensitive setting with an improvement in failure free survival in high risk and metastatic patients and increase in overall survival in the metastatic hormone-sensitive group. In these recent randomized controlled trials patients were treated with hormonal therapy and radiotherapy and adjuvant docetaxel assuming that early systemic treatment for high risk or metastatic disease could delay progression in patients with aggressive primary tumor characteristics. With the fact that docetaxel is a known radiosensitizer combined modality treatment with docetaxel during the radiotherapy could also lead to better local control and reduction of local recurrence. Several phase I and II studies have been done in HRPC patients to evaluate the combination of high dose radiotherapy and concurrent weekly infusions with docetaxel. Oral administration of docetaxel has many advantages above intravenously administered drugs for patients. Besides the higher patient convenience possibly longer treatment duration can be achieved due to better safety. Frequently occurring toxicities of intravenously administered docetaxel such as neutropenia hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral polyneuropathy have rarely been observed with the oral docetaxel formulation ModraDoc006/r. The primary aim of the N15DOP study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of ModraDoc006/r when given in a weekly bidaily schedule in combined modality with high dose intensity radiotherapy and hormonal therapy in castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients with high risk disease including positive lymph nodes.    ,NCT03066154

Initially a tolerability and safety phase (phase Ib escalation) will be performed to confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended doses of both BI 836845 and enzalutamide that can be taken together. Once the MTD or recommended phase II dose have been determined an expansion cohort will also be explored (phase Ib expansion) in CRPC patients already taking enzalutamide and have a rise in prostate serum antigen (PSA) levels. Patients may not have received prior docetaxel or abiraterone. Patients in this cohort will receive the MTD or recommended phase II dose of BI 836845 and enzalutamide determined in the phase Ib escalation phase. The randomised trial (phase II) will be an open label parallel group study design in a 1:1 ratio to which patients will receive either BI 836845 plus enzalutamide (Arm A) at the MTD/recommended doses or enzalutamide alone (Arm B).

Prostate Cancer,FACBC for Recurrent Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor with approximately 200000 new cases diagnosed per year. Several different local therapies are available for treatment; including surgery and radiotherapy Significant advances have been made which have improved the cancer control outcomes and treatment. Despite these significant advances approximately 30% of patients treated with definitive local therapy experience recurrent disease. Recurrent (returning) disease usually displays rising PSA (blood test for prostate cancer). The PSA level is often of limited use in differentiating local recurrence (i.e. recurrence in the prostate bed) from recurrence outside of the prostate bed (extra-prostatic recurrence). Imaging plays a central role in the detection of recurrent prostate carcinoma in the prostate bed and in the differentiation of prostatic from extraprostatic recurrence. There are newer methods of imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) with molecular radiotracers that are currently under study for the imaging of post-therapy recurrence. One PET radiotracer which has shown promise in the staging and restaging of patients with prostate carcinoma is anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (anti-3-[18F]FACBC) which is a synthetic amino acid analog. FACBC demonstrated higher accuracy compared with other methods in the restaging of patients with suspected recurrent prostate carcinoma. FACBC has been tested in over 140 subjects in other studies in the Emory system including 128 subjects with prostate cancer. The investigators will perform a study with 25 patients in whom the investigators have a strong suspicion of prostate cancer that has returned to the body after having an initial treatment. The major goal of the investigation is to see whether anti-[18F] FACBC PET-CT and MRI imaging individually then together will be useful in the detection of local and extraprostatic recurrence of prostate cancer. Routine blood test will be done on the day of the FACBC scan and one week later as required by the FDA. All patients will undergo biopsy of the prostate as clinically appropriate per standard of care. If either the FACBC or MRI scans indicate cancer recurrence the subject's cancer site(s) will also be biopsied as clinically appropriate. Biopsy of the suspected recurrence sites will be scheduled at the subjects' convenience as soon as possible after the scans. Tissue obtained from the biopsy will undergo standard analysis to determine if prostate carcinoma cells are present. The secondary goal will be to use left-over biopsy material to determine if there are genotypic differences between prostate carcinoma recurrence confined to the prostate bed and extraprostatic recurrence    ,NCT01808222
Prostate Cancer,Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer After Undergoing Surgery, This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer after undergoing surgery.

Prostate Cancer,Brachytherapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer, After a curative treatment by radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer between 20% and 50% of patients may have a biological relapse as a progressive re -rise of PSA. After prostate brachytherapy with low flow this rate is between 2% and 6%. Depending on risk factors initially present some patients will have a micro metastatic disease at the time of re-rise but others will have a true local recurrence purely intra-prostate. Local recurrence after radiotherapy is associated with a high incidence of distant metastatic relapse and poor overall survival. For these reasons the possibility of offering a local treatment for this selected population of patients can have a major therapeutic interest and allow changing a situation often considered palliative to the possibility of a second curative treatment. Currently there is no consensus regarding the optimal management of patients with purely local recurrence after prostate irradiation at first intention. When an external radiotherapy or brachytherapy is performed as first choice in a patient with prostate cancer several remedial treatments have been proposed with controversial results the decision-making for clinicians and for difficult patients. These main therapeutic options remedial (surgery cryotherapy and brachytherapy) have the potential for complications such as rectal injury impotence or incontinence Brachytherapy is a new salvage treatment being evaluated in the United States (Phase II study of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group No. 0526). Several retrospective trials have shown very encouraging results in terms of acute toxicity and biochemical control in the short term. Thus a team from Mount Sinai in New York recently published for the first time 10 years retrospective results with this approach. In their experience after treatment failures with external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy a dose of 122 Gy was delivered over 90% of the prostate gland. Doing this they observed biochemical control rates and survival specific of 54 % and 96 % respectively at 10 years with an hormone treatment associated (median 6 months) in 84 % of cases. Four patients had grade 3 toxicity or higher (11%). To reduce the rate of late toxicities the team from the University Of California San Francisco (UCSF) tested focal brachytherapy guided by functional MRI (MRI spectroscopy) to re-treat local recurrence after initial brachytherapy as monotherapy or boost. By delivering 144 Gy on recidivism objectified on MRI the authors observed that a minimal dose of 37Gy covered 90 % of the prostate gland to treat the risk of microscopic disease. Doing this the rate of observed toxicities and biochemical control appeared encouraging with a median follow-up of 2 years since no grade 3 toxicity was observed and 74% of patients achieved a PSA nadir <0.5 ng / mL without associated hormone. In case of external radiation or brachytherapy several attempts proposed to associate an injection of hyaluronic acid gel to the prostate - rectum interface to spare healthy tissue irradiated and thus reduce the rate of radiation proctitis. The feasibility of implementing this gel has been demonstrated in patients with non- irradiated tissues. No inherent toxicity of the injection of hyaluronic acid gel has been described after prostate brachytherapy first line. The feasibility of this injection remains unproven to date on patients previously irradiated externally or by brachytherapy. We hypothesize that the risk of radiation proctitis and fistulas front prostate could be reduced using this technique in this indication. We propose to carry out a French prospective multicenter phase II trial combining brachytherapy remedial with an injection of hyaluronic acid after surgery to reduce the risk of radiation proctitis and / or recto -urinary fistula in a patient population hyper- selected with a high probability of isolated local recurrence.    ,NCT01956058

Hyperthermia therapy may make tumor cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy by heating them to several degrees above normal body temperature. Giving hyperthermia and high dose rate radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with recurrent prostate cancer after radiation.    ,NCT02899221
Prostate Cancer,Prospective Evaluation of 68-Ga-prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-Positron Emission Tomograph (PET) and Early Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) Kinetics During Salvage Radiotherapy for Personalizing the Management of Men With Relapse of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy, This is an open-label phase II trial in patients with PSA recurrence after prostatectomy. Patients entering the study will all receive initial 50 Gray (Gy) radiotherapy (25 x 2Gy) to the prostate bed and thereafter be classified as either responders or non-responders depending on PSA response at fifth week of radiotherapy. A 68-Ga- PSMA-PET is done before start of radiotherapy and analyzed before fifth treatment week in order to identify cancer lesions in patients with poor PSA response. Patients with PSA response after 5 weeks of radiotherapy will not receive any subsequent therapy whilst patients with poor PSA response may be in need for additional therapy such as radiotherapy to lymph node metastases and/or boost fractions to local recurrence. Patients with more than 3 lymph node metastases or distant metastases will not receive any more radiotherapy but individualized systemic therapy will be started.    ,NCT02699424

Prostate Cancer,Endoscopic Evaluation of Late Rectal Injury Following CyberKnife Radiosurgery for Prostate Cancer, Radiation therapy is a well-established treatment modality for clinically localized prostate cancer. Men who choose to undergo radiation treatments for prostate cancer will have to live with the side effects for many years. Attempts have been made to protect surrounding tissues while delivering high dosage of radiation to cancer. With the rectum being so close to the prostate many patients still suffer from side effects caused by radiation injury to the rectum especially those who received conventional external beam radiotherapy. CyberKnife is an FDA approved radiosurgical devise. Its flexible robotic arm allows radiation beams to be delivered in different directions providing a highly conformal uniform dose with steep dose gradients. Therefore treatment with the CyberKnife radiosurgical system should minimize the toxicity to the surrounding structures. CyberKnife System also incorporates a dynamic tracking system to allow the robot to correct the targeting of therapeutic beams during treatment. These improvements allow for dose escalation within the prostate with less normal tissue toxicity. The purpose of this study is to estimate the proportion of patients with endoscopically detectable telangiectasia as the indication of radiation injury to the rectum after CyberKnife Treatment for prostate cancer.    ,NCT01618838

Prostate Cancer,Ketoconazole With or Without Alendronate Sodium in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Ketoconazole may suppress the production of hormones and may interfere in the growth of prostate cancer cells. Alendronate sodium may be effective in preventing bone metastases and bone pain associated with prostate cancer. It is not known if ketoconazole is more effective with or without alendronate sodium. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ketoconazole with or without alendronate sodium in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer.    ,NCT00019695
Prostate Cancer,Docetaxel With or Without Thalidomide in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Thalidomide may stop the growth of prostate cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of docetaxel with or without thalidomide in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer.    ,NCT00020046
Prostate Cancer,Pembrolizumab and Cryosurgery in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Oligo-metastatic Prostate Cancer, This pilot phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab and cryosurgery work with short term androgen ablation to treat patients with prostate cancer that has traveled from the original tumor through the body and formed a small number of new tumors in other parts of the body (oligo-metastatic). Cryosurgery also known as cryoablation or cryotherapy kills tumor cells by freezing them. The process also incites an immune response within the ablated tumor. Giving monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab which enhance a systemic anti-cancer immune response may augment the effects of cryosurgery and increase tumor killing at distant (metastatic) sites.    ,NCT02489357

Prostate Cancer,Discovery Stage Clinical Study About Oncology Drugs and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, That current oncology drugs on USA market have the universal problems about low effectiveness of pharmacology to cancer cells and high risk of toxicology to normal cells can demonstrate following most significantly and most reasonably: it is not enough so far that just only oncology drug targets directly like as cancer patient-specific biomarkers; it must be that oncology drug targets' SNPs via patient-specific haplotype blocks like as real personalized or individualized cancer patient-specific biomarkers.    ,NCT02403505
Prostate Cancer,Evaluation of a Transrectal Scintigraphic Detector(ProxiScanTM) for Detection of Primary Prostate Cancer, This is a feasibility exploratory and proof-of-concept study to evaluate rectal probe scintigraphy device (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific radiopharmaceutical agent (ProstaScint®) in patients with suspected primary prostate cancer. ProxiScanTM is a small cadmium zinc telluride (CST)-based compact gamma camera the size of a trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) developed by Hybridyne Imaging Technologies Inc.To explore the adjunctive benefit/feasibility of PSMA distribution in the normal prostate versus prostate cancer gland utilizing TRUS and CT/SPECT hybrid imaging biopsy negative patients will be considered as normal controls. Prostate cancer sextant biopsy histology results will be correlated with ProxiScanTM TRUS and pelvis planar and SPECT/CT. Our hypothesis is that it will be safe and feasible to utilize a rectal probe scintigraphy (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific ProstaScint® uptake in primary prostate cancer.    ,NCT01359189
Prostate Cancer,Digital Application Usage for Adherence of Patients Undergoing Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Following Oncological and Postoperative Functional Outcomes, Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common non-skin tumor in men and the second leading cause of death from cancer in Brazil. It accounts for 13.8% of deaths from cancer in males similar to what happens with breast cancer in females corresponding to 15.8% of cancer deaths in women. Mobile applications software developed for smartphones and tablets used for many different purposes (games communication entertainment etc) have become important tools of mHealth (Mobile Health in Portuguese - mobile health) as they allow remote support to patients or self-promotion of health care. It has been used globally to assist in the treatment and control of various diseases such as diabetes physical inactivity and many others. In oncology there are several applications developed to assist in the monitoring and treatment of various cancers such as gastric and breast cancer. So far it has not developed an application for follow-up of patients with PC to capture data on satisfaction of post-treatment patient regarding the comorbidity of surgery and also loyalty and adherence of patients to follow-up in offices allowing a possible intervention it is done at the right time. Nor was made compared to assess whether there is benefit in using this application. Thus the objective of this work is to develop an application for smartphones facing the postoperative follow-up of patients undergoing robotic radical prostatectomy and compare adherence to treatment compared to accompanied by traditional way patient. In addition we will evaluate the progress of the IPSS ICIQ and IIEF-5 compared to preoperatively in patients undergoing prostatectomy robotic radical.    ,NCT02809495
