Melanoma,Efficacy of Chemotherapy Combined With Regional Hypothermia in Advanced Malignant Melanoma Patients With Progressive Soft Tissue Metastases, The incidence of malignant melanoma continues to rise throughout the world. Approximately 12 in 100000 Germans are diagnosed with malignant melanoma per year. Malignant melanoma is often very aggressive since it may spread both through the lymphatic system and the bloodstream at an early stage of disease. While treatment of localized disease is mostly surgical in patients with extensive disease prognosis remains poor; the primary standard therapy of metastastic disease comprises dacarbazine (DTIC) eventually combined with other chemotherapeutic agents e.g. cisplatin or BCNU. The duration of response to systemic chemotherapy is generally short and so far no standard second-line treatment has been established. To study the potential additional therapeutic effects of regional hyperthermia in advanced malignant melanoma patients with progressive chemotherapy refractory soft tissue metastases in the present trial we sought to compine local hyperthermia with concomitant systemic second-line chemotherapy.    ,NCT00264056

Melanoma,Dabrafenib and Trametinib in People With BRAF V600E Mutation Positive Lesions in Erdheim Chester Disease, Erdheim-Chester Diseases (ECD) is a very rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis of unknown origin and pathogenesis. It has been reported mainly in adult males over the age of 40 years although cases have been reported in females as well. Children are rarely affected. Mutation of the BRAF gene specifically BRAFV600E has been recently identified in 50% of Erdheim Chester lesions in a French cohort. This somatic mutation is believed to be the driver mutation in positive cases. The clinical characteristics of ECD range from asymptomatic to multisystemic involvement; longitudinal progression and natural history are becoming better understood. ECD commonly affects the bones kidneys retroperitoneal space skin and brain. If untreated the disease progresses rapidly causing fatal outcomes due to severe lung disease chronic renal failure cardiomyopathy and other complications. The diagnosis of ECD relies upon imaging studies and specific pathologic findings in biopsies of affected organs i.e. fibrosis and infiltration of tissues with foamy histiocytes lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemistry reveals cells positive for CD68 and CD163 and negative for CD1a with 20% positivity to S-100. There is no standard treatment for ECD although chemotherapy radiation stem cell transplantion alpha-interferon anakinra imatinib and sirolimus have been proposed. The recent discovery of the BRAFV600E mutation in several ECD patients has opened a new area for treatment options. Vemurafenib an FDA approved BRAF inhibitor for the treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma with the V600E mutation binds to this form of mutated BRAF causing protein inactivation. The use of vemurafenib in patients with ECD has been reported in 3 patients who experienced remission of the disease and is currently being studied in the U.S. and Europe as monotherapy. Tumor/disease resistance to vemurafenib has occurred in melanoma and other cancers although it has not been reported in patients with ECD. In this protocol we propose to clinically evaluate ECD patients with the BRAFV600E mutation and administer combination therapy with dabrafenib a BRAFV600E inhibitor and trametinib an inhibitor of MEK downstream of BRAF. Screening for possible contraindications will be made prior to the administration of the first dose. With this trial we will determine the safety tolerability and efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with ECD who harbor the BRAFV600E mutation. Dabrafenib 150mg will be given twice daily p.o.; trametinib 2mg will be given once daily p.o. Patients will be seen 1 week 1 month 2 months 4 months and 6 months 8 months 10 months and 12 months to complete a oneyear trial.    ,NCT02281760

Melanoma,Minimal SN Tumor Burden, The purpose of this registry is to collect data in order to discover whether melanoma patients with minimal SN tumor burden should undergo a complete lymph node dissection (CLND) or not. Currently if a patient has a positive (or metastatic) SN this patient will be offered a CLND which is a surgical intervention aiming to remove all lymph nodes from the same nodal basin as the SN. However if the positive (or metastatic) SN is only minimally involved some centers and/or countries do not offer a CLND routinely. As a matter of fact the CLND procedure does not increase survival for patients with a minimal SN tumor burden but can add prognostic information potentially useful in the subsequent decision-making process. However this is a surgical operation for the patient which might be accompanied by significant side effects. Moreover only approximately 20% of patients with a metastatic SN have further lymph node metastases in the same basin which means that about 4 patients out of 5 will not benefit from a CLND. Thus there is an urgent need to identify which SN positive patients could be safely spared from a CLND. It has been demonstrated that breast cancer patients with minimal SN tumor burden can be safely managed with nodal observation only without performing a CLND. There is evidence that the same situation exists in melanoma as well but this needs to be validated and this is why we are conducting this registry. The results of this registry will be crucial to establish an accepted standard of care (CLND or nodal observation) for melanoma patients with minimal SN tumor burden.    ,NCT01942603

Melanoma,Targeted Silica Nanoparticles for Image-Guided Intraoperative Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Head and Neck Melanoma Breast and Gynecologic Malignancies," Current imaging devices usually detect cancer prior to surgery. However these devices cannot be used during the surgical procedure to visualize lymph nodes with cancer (called ""sentinel lymph nodes""). The groups are for head and neck melanoma gynecologic and breast cancers. As a part of the standard of care the they will initially undergo imaging of their lymph nodes prior to their surgery. Melanoma and breast cancer patients will be injected with a radioactive dye around the tumor site and images will be acquired about 2 hours the location of the later using a device to image the dye. For gynecologic cancer patients they will be injected with a indocyanine green in the operating room and then images will be acquired soon after. In addition the investigators will test for the first time in humans a new experimental dye-labeled particle (dots) cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots for lymph node mapping. This particle the size of a small protein will be injected around sites of melanoma before or during your surgery to identify diseased nodes using a hand-held camera system. The dye-labeled particle can be viewed in tissues that may contain tumor. Based upon the clinical diagnosis the patient may have a procedure called Reverse Lymphatic Mapping which is a new form of sentinel lymph node mapping. The doctor will discuss this with the patient. If the patient is undergoing reverse lymphatic mapping they will have the experimental particle injected into their hand or foot (based on their tumor type) and the standard of care injection will be injected around the tumor. This will allow the surgeon to remove only the lymph nodes that directly link to the tumor. The particles will not treat the cancer and any images or information found during this study will not be used for your treatment. The information collected may be used to guide the design of future studies to detect and/or treat tumors.    ",NCT02106598

Melanoma,Evaluation of the Impact of Adjuvants Accompanying Peptide Immunization in High-Risk Melanoma, This study will evaluate the immunization effects of a vaccine for patients who are at risk for recurrence of their skin cancer. That is the risk of cancer is higher if melanoma has invaded deep into the skin or lymph nodes. Currently the only therapy that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for preventing recurrence of melanoma is alpha-interferon. But the research data are controversial. In this study the vaccine to be used called gp100 contains a piece of a protein called a peptide which melanoma cancer cells produce. Patients 16 and older who have had confirmed melanoma surgically removed and whose tissue type is tested as being human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A serotype group (HLA-A2) through a specific blood test may be eligible for this study. Up to 132 participants will be enrolled. There will be a physical examination and collection of blood samples for tests and making sure that x-rays and scans are current. Patients will be randomly assigned to four groups. Group 1 will receive the peptide with an adjuvant (assistant) oil-based liquid called Montanide ISA-51 as an injection in the thigh. Group 2 will receive gp100 Montanide and a cream called imiquimod which the FDA has approved for treating genital warts and herpes but that may help immune cells in the skin to recognize the vaccine. Imiquimod will be applied to the skin for 5 days. Group 3 will receive gp100 mixed in salt water given as several mini-doses under the skin of the thigh. Group 4 will also receive several mini-doses of gp100 mixed in saline as well as imiquimod cream applied to the skin for 5 days. All patients will receive the gp100 every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Every dose is a cycle with four cycles considered a course of therapy. If the melanoma does not return or patients do not experience side effects from this therapy then the courses of vaccine will repeated for up to 12 cycles of therapy (3 courses over 33 weeks). Side effects of the peptide vaccination include local swelling swelling of local lymph nodes bruising and pain and redness at the injection sites. There may be chills or fever. Patients will be watched closely for such side effects. To study how the vaccine changes the action of cells in the immune system patients' white blood cells (lymphocytes) will be obtained involving a separate informed consent. The procedure called leukaphersis requires inserting a needle into the arm to obtain blood going into a machine which divides the blood into red cells plasma (or the serum part) and lymphocytes. The lymphocytes are removed and the plasma and red cells returned to the patient through a second needle in the other arm. Risks associated with the procedure include fainting which can be prevented by patients' eating before coming to the lab and bleeding and infection at the needle site. Patients will undergo leukapheresis will be done about four times: before receiving the vaccine 3 weeks after the first four doses and then after 8 cycles and 12 cycles. Patients assigned to the groups receiving imiquimod will be asked to record every time they apply that cream and describe any symptoms developed during the study. All patients will be watched closely for any sign that their melanoma has returned. Before and throughout the study multiple blood tests will be conducted. The vaccine Montanide and imiquimod may increase patients' immune system in fighting off new tumors but that is not known now. However the study may provide information that will be useful in treating melanoma patients in the future.    ,NCT00273910

Melanoma,Relevance of Imiquimod as Neo-adjuvant Treatment to Reduce Excision Size and the Risk of Intralesional Excision in Lentigo Malignant of the Face, Lentigo malignant (LM) is an intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation occurring on photoexposed skin. In our project this term applies both to Dubreuilh's melanosis and to Dubreuilh's intraepidermal melanoma. It consequently excludes invasive melanoma. Although surgery is the treatment of choice it remains without consensus on the margins (5 mm or 10 mm) excision for a localized tumor on the face. Several studies have shown that imiquimod activating local immunity by interferon production induced LM or MLM regression and could also decrease the frequency of relapses. The principal aim of our project is to study the effect of imiquimod versus vehicle in pre-operative neoadjuvant treatment aimed at reducing both surgical margins as from the first surgical procedure and the frequency of short and medium term recurrence of LM. Furthermore the improvement in patient quality of life could also be significant.    ,NCT01720407

Melanoma,DNA Repair Inhibitor & Irradiation on Melanoma, Phase I trial will be conducted in patients suffering local metastatic melanoma with relapsed cutaneous/subcutaneous tumors including melanoma-in-transit. Based on the preclinical data package DNA Therapeutics has considered that the risk-benefit ratio of DT01 supports the initiation of a phase I clinical study in this population. The recommended starting dose of DT01 for the first injection to human was based on NOAELs and Maximum Recommended Starting Dose (MRSD) calculations and by considering both local and systemic approaches. It was set at 16 mg (4 mg per injection site 2 injections per tumor 2 tumors to be treated). This starting dose will be increased up to 96 mg if no DLT occurred during dose escalation. DT01 will be locally administered by peritumoral subcutaneous and/or intratumoral injections in combination with hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (RT) (10x 3 Gy) and chloroquine (100 mg oral QD) starting one week before DT01 and RT treatments. DT01 will be administered 3 times a week during two weeks; The study will be an open non-randomised multicentre phase I dose escalation (16 32 48 64 and 96 mg) safety study with a 3+3 design. The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the safety tolerance pharmacokinetics of DT01 in association with palliative radiotherapy and to evaluate pharmacodynamics and the anti-tumor activity of DT01 according to RECIST criteria on day 26 40 and 54. The duration of response (Time-To-Local Recurrence TTLR) will be monitored 3 6 9 and 12 months after the beginning of the DT01 treatment.    ,NCT01469455
Melanoma,Sargramostim and/or Vaccine Therapy in Preventing Disease Recurrence in Patients With Advanced Melanoma, This randomized phase III trial studies sargramostim (Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF) or vaccine therapy alone to see how well they work compared to sargramostim and vaccine therapy together in preventing disease recurrence in patients with locally advanced or stage IV melanoma that has been removed by surgery. Sargramostim may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether yeast derived sargramostim and vaccine therapy are more effective alone or together in preventing recurrence of melanoma.    ,NCT01989572

Melanoma,A Study of Intratumoral CAVATAK in Patients With Stage IIIc and Stage IV Malignant Melanoma, Approximately 63 patients with stage IIIc or stage IV melanoma will receive 10 intratumoural injections of CAVATAK (Coxsackievirus A21) over 18 weeks. Disease progression will be monitored by computed tomography (CT) and rated by the RECIST 1.1 assessment criteria. Patients will be monitored for 1 year from their first treatment. CAVATAK is an oncolytic (cancer killing) virus. Direct injection of the virus into tumors may kill cancer cells by the lytic action of the virus. This action also releases tumor cell debris that may illicit a response by the patients own immune system against the tumour. This study seeks to assess the performance of CAVATAK in both of these actions in late stage melanoma. Study objectives include:   -  Immune-related Progression-Free Survival   -  Durable Response Rate   -  Progression Free Survival at 6 months   -  Quality of Life    ,NCT01227551
Melanoma,Lapatinib in Stage IV Melanoma With ERBB4 Mutations, Background: - Studies of melanoma tumor samples have shown that tumor cells from approximately 20 percent of melanoma patients contain a specific mutation of a gene involved in making a protein called ERBB4 and that changes in this gene have been associated with cancer. Lapatinib a drug that is currently approved for the treatment of breast cancer has been shown in the laboratory to significantly slow the growth of melanoma cells that contain this specific ERBB4 gene mutation. Researchers are interested in determining whether lapatinib can be effective against melanoma in individuals who have the ERBB4 mutation. Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of lapatinib as a treatment for melanoma with ERBB4 mutation that has not responded to standard therapy. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have stage 4 melanoma that has not responded to standard therapy. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history as well as tests of tumor tissue taken from previous surgeries or biopsies or from a new biopsy that will be conducted before the start of the study. Test results to determine eligibility will be available within about 2 weeks.   -  Participants will take four lapatinib tablets daily (two in the morning 1 hour before or after breakfast and two in the evening 1 hour before or after dinner) during every 28-day cycle of treatment. Participants will keep a medication diary to record tablets taken and any side effects from the medication.   -  After the first 2 weeks and every 2 to 4 weeks afterward for the first 12 weeks participants will have clinic visits with blood samples and other tests to determine if lapatinib is causing their disease to shrink or be controlled. If the disease has not progressed participants will continue to receive a new lapatinib supply every 28 days for up to 2 years (27 cycles) and will continue to have regular clinic visits to monitor the progress of treatment.   -  When tumor tissue is easily accessible and can be easily biopsied researchers will collect two additional biopsies one after 2 weeks of treatment and one after 12 weeks of treatment....    ,NCT01264081

Melanoma,Early Diagnosis of Malignant Transformation of Pigmentary Skin Lesions, Malignant Melanoma is a deadly skin cancer that can be cured if diagnosed early. To date atypical pigmented skin lesions are diagnosed by appearance alone and many moles and lesions are excised unnecessarily and on the other hand malignant lesions are missed and diagnosed too late. In this study a protein conjugated to a florescent dye is spread on a suspicious pigmented lesion the hypothesis is that this protein binds to malignant cells only and thus with a special camera that picks up the dye we can find pigmented lesions with early malignant transformation.    ,NCT01167998
Melanoma,Definition of an Immune Signature Predictive of Anti-PD1 (Programmed Death-1) Antibody in the Treatment of Advanced Melanoma, Melanoma is the most aggressive skin cancer. Major advances in metastatic melanoma treatment emerge from new immunotherapies that target specific immune inhibitory checkpoint receptors mainly PD1 and CTLA-4 and overcome the exhaustion state of T cells. In this context checkpoint inhibitors such as Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies mAb) and Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab (anti-PD1 mAb) have demonstrated survival benefit in advanced melanoma patients. Anti-PD1 agents and combination of anti-PD1 and anti CTLA-4 have now been approved as first line therapy in melanoma. However the predictive factors of response to these immunotherapies remain so far elusive. Recent studies provided consistent evidence that the immune infiltration could be tested as a biomarker for such immunotherapies. Moreover the very recent concept of tumor neoantigens as biomarkers of response to anti-CTLA-4 mAb and potentially also to anti-PD1 or combination therapies is promising but needs to be further explored. In this context the aim of our program is to identify and validate an immune signature predictive of anti-PD-1 benefit in the treatment of advanced melanoma patients. To this aim tumor samples from 120 melanoma patients enrolled prospectively treated with anti-PD1 mAb alone or combined with anti CTLA4 will be collected as well as the corresponding peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Tumor infiltration with immune cells will be characterized on paraffin embedded melanoma samples. The investigators will also perform whole-exome sequencing on tumors and matched PBMC samples. Our primary objective is to develop a combined immuno-signature based on an immuno-score (CD3 CD8 CD45RO?? to quantify the in situ immune populations with a dedicated image analysis system combined with the simultaneous detection of CD8-PD-1 and PD-L1 by immunofluorescence in baseline tumor samples. This will permit to predict 1-year survival of patients with advanced melanoma treated with anti-PD1 and transfer in patient's care. Our secondary objectives are: 1/ To assess the interest of the detection of tissue-resident memory (TRM) T cells (CD8-CD103) as a predictive biomarker of response and survival at 1-year; 2/ To extend the panel of neoantigens published by Snyder et al to other neoantigens using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach on tumor samples obtained before therapy; 3/ To establish the prognostic value of this panel of neoantigens to predict tumor response to anti-PD1 and 1-year survival; 4/ To functionally validate the identified tumor neoantigens by stimulating patient PBMC with neoantigen peptides and measuring tumor-specific T-cell reactivity; 5/ To define the best marker and/or the best combination of markers predicting the overall response rate and the survival at 12 and 18 months; 6/ To attempt to establish a correlation between immuno-signature and neoepitopes and 7/ To transfer this immune signature in routine basis if validated. Thus our project will integrate two complementary strategies to define a robust and reliable score system for predicting anti-PD1 targeting immunotherapy response. This study will provide a unique opportunity to validate various putative biomarkers in an integrated way that could help in determining the respective value of each isolated parameter and potentially lead to the definition of a composite biomarker. The identified immune signature would be of major interest in the field of cancer immunotherapy in order to select and manage patient treatment and to consider the benefice or toxicities expected. It will also help to identify new target antigens of effective antitumoral immune responses and to understand the resistance mechanisms established by the tumor and its influence on the response to current immunotherapies.    ,NCT02938728
Melanoma,Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of a Sequencing Schedule of Cobimetinib Plus Vemurafenib Followed by Immunotherapy With an Anti- PD-L1 Antibody in Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600 Mutant Melanoma, Most patients with locally advanced or metastatic tumors succumb to their disease. Thus there is a substantial need for novel therapeutic strategies to improve the outcome for patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma. Targeting the the Ras/Raf signalling pathway by BRAF and MEK inhibition as well as targeting immunologic checkpoint control with an antiPD-L1 antibody have emerged as treatment option. In this study the best timing for sequential use of both treatment options (BRAF/MEK inhibition and antiPD-L1 antibody) in patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAFV600 mutant melanoma will be assessed.    ,NCT02902029
Melanoma,Dabrafenib and Trametinib for BRAF-inhibitor Pretreated Patients, Patients with BRAF V600 mutant advanced melanoma benefit from treatment with a BRAF-inhibitor (e.g. dabrafenib vemurafenib) and from combination of a BRAF- and MEK-inhibitor (e.g. dabrafenib and trametinib). Following initial tumor regression progression is diagnosed in a majority of patients treated with BRAF-inhibitor mono-therapy within the first 12-months of therapy. Various molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of resistance to treatment with a BRAF-inhibitor have been reported. These mechanisms do not include secondary mutations in the BRAF-gene and therefore resistance to BRAF-inhibition could potentially be reversible when selective pressure by BRAF-inhibition is withheld for a sufficient period of time of melanoma progression. This clinical trial protocol addresses the potential renewed anti-tumor activity of combined BRAF- and MEK inhibition with the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with unresectable AJCC stage III or - IV BRAF V600 mutant melanoma who are documented with progression of disease at least 12 weeks following the last day of dosing of a BRAFinhibitor containing treatment regimen.    ,NCT02296996

Melanoma,Follow-up of a National Cohort of Melanoma Stage IV and Unresectable Stage III Patients, Prevention of melanoma can be efficient but mortality remains unchanged and 15 to 20% of patients still die from melanoma. Indeed metastatic melanoma is a heterogeneous highly and multiple mutations driven cancer. Significant survival benefit was demonstrated since 2011 with anti-CTLA4 programmed death-1 (anti PD1) antibodies B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors. Future improvement of advanced melanoma prognosis will rely on clinico-epidemiological studies and on biological studies aiming to validate and identify new prognostic and predictive factors based upon clinico-epidemiological and histological data genomic host and tumor alterations tumor microenvironment characteristics individual immunological profile and functional imaging. In the context of marketing of costly innovative molecules prospective collection of economic data on treatment and toxicity are required. Large biobanks collecting data from cohorts of advanced melanoma are mandatory for such projects. MELBASE is a French prospective national cohort enrolling advanced melanoma patients whose objectives are :   -  To provide an annual instrument panel with a descriptive and correlative analysis of patients with advanced melanoma in France including epidemiological clinical and biological socio-economic characteristics   -  to validate and identify new clinical epidemiological and biological prognostic factors such as genomic host and tumor alterations tumor microenvironment characteristics individual immunological profile in advanced melanoma.   -  to evaluate the risk-benefit the impact on treatment on patient quality of life the management cost of patients treated with the validated and future treatments of metastatic melanoma.

Melanoma,Study of Radiotherapy Administered in Combination With Ipilimumab in Patients With Unresectable Stage III or Stage IV Advanced Malignant Melanoma, RATIONALE:Anti-melanoma activity of Ipilimumab both as a single therapy and in association with melanoma peptides has been shown as well as synergy between radiation therapy and anti-CTLA-A mAb in several tumor animal models for both local tumor control and distant effects.Radiotherapy increases tumor immunogenicity in several preclinical models by increasing MHC molecules expression and is able to induce significant tumor reduction in around 30% of cases. Thus combining radiotherapy and administration of ipilimumab could elicit systemic antitumor response. Radiation therapy will expose tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and facilitate antigen presentation and further blockade of CTLA-4 could amplify the immune antitumor response. In this therapeutical model the use of the own patient tumor as a source of tumor antigens (in opposition with other vaccination protocols where TAA are exogenic) is particularly adapted. PURPOSE: This Phase I trial determines the side effects and best dose of radiation therapy administered in combination with ipilimumab.    ,NCT01557114

Melanoma,High Dose Interleukin-2 Followed by Intermittent Low Dose Temozolomide in Patients With Melanoma, The investigators have recently observed that many patients who had received high dose Interleukin-2 (IL2) and failed to respond to it but who then go immediately to temozolomide seemed to enjoy extremely good responses which seem better quality and longer duration than typically observed for temozolomide alone. To date the investigators have observed 5 sequentially treated patients with metastatic melanoma who had failed high dose IL-2 but who then went on to receive immediate temozolomide. Two of these patients had complete responses and 3 had very strong partial response. In a recent phase II study of extended low dose temozolomide alone given in the same manner as the post IL-2 patients noted above the response rate was 12.5% and all of these were partial responses only. The responses that the investigators observed were at a much higher rate of response as well as much better quality than expected for temozolomide. The responses were also better than those observed when temozolomide was given first and then followed by high dose IL-2. The investigators concluded that perhaps the major benefit the investigators observed was a result of the prior high dose IL-2 therapy modulated by the temozolomide and that the sequence of treatment was clearly crucial for this response.    ,NCT01124734

It is hoped that the immune response to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the patient's own cancer cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern causing the tumor to remain stable or shrink. Patients 18 years of age or older with malignant melanoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with medical history and physical examination blood tests urinalysis chest x-rays and CT scans. MRI PET and ultrasound scans may be obtained if needed. Participants will receive twelve vaccinations two weeks apart from each other. The vaccines will be injected under the skin similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase I of the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the vaccine cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase II will look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be safe in Phase I. Monthly blood samples will be drawn during the 6 months of vaccine treatment. In addition patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 3 months for the remaining first year (6 months) after vaccination and then every 6 months for the next 2 years for the following tests and procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects: Medical history and physical examination Blood tests X-rays and various scans (nuclear medicine/CT/MRI) FACT-G Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the patient's general well-being.

Melanoma,Phase 1b/2 Study of the Combination of IMCgp100 With Durvalumab and/or Tremelimumab in Cutaneous Melanoma, This study is a Phase Ib/II multi-center open-label study of IMCgp100 as a single agent and in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and/or tremelimumab in metastatic cutaneous melanoma. The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics (PK) pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of IMCgp100 in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736 programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] inhibitor) tremelimumab (CLTA-4 inhibitor) and the combination of durvalumab with tremelimumab compared to single-agent IMCgp100 alone. The study will enroll patients who have metastatic melanoma that is refractory to treatment with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor as well as patients naive to therapy in the metastatic setting. Recent biologic evidence indicates that optimal responses to programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) directed therapy require the presence of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment and thus therapies such as IMCgp100 that recruit these effector cells to the tumor may overcome pre-existing resistance to checkpoint blockade. This emerging biology of checkpoint inhibitor resistance suggests the combination of IMCgp100 with checkpoint inhibition may have enhanced activity in patients with pre-existing resistance.    ,NCT02535078

Melanoma,Autologous TriMix-DC Therapeutic Vaccine in Combination With Ipilimumab in Patients With Previously Treated Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma, The CTLA-4 blocking monoclonal antibody ipilimumab (MDX-010 BMS-734016) has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in a subgroup of patients with Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma (measurable per modified WHO criteria) who have received prior treatment with any regimen (non-experimental or experimental) except a CD-137 agonist or a CTLA4 inhibitor or agonist and relapsed failed to respond (CR or PR) or did not tolerate that regimen (Wolchok Neyns et al. 2009; O'Day Maio et al. 2010). Ipilimumab exerts its therapeutic effect presumably by activating T-lymphocytes that infiltrate the tumor mass to destroy the malignant cells by mechanisms of cytotoxic cellular interaction.

Melanoma,Skin Care Behaviors Among Melanoma Survivors and Their Families," A patient's sun-related behavior greatly influences the likelihood of that patient developing melanoma the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Prior research shows current education strategies on inducing preventative behaviors such as wearing sun-protection clothing and wearing sunscreen are inadequate at effectively changing behavior when used in isolation -- patients are aware of the dangers of not engaging in these preventative measures but forgo them nonetheless. We are investigating methods to positively influence sun protection behaviors among melanoma survivors and their families. The first objective is to compare patient and familial sun exposure and cancer screening activity before and after patients' diagnosis with primary melanoma. The second objective is to note if hanging a ""Melanoma Survivor"" plaque in a melanoma survivor's bathroom will significantly affect the survivor's and broader family's sun exposure and cancer screening activity. Our sample of patients consists of survivors of primary cutaneous melanoma less than 4.0 mm in depth who come through the Dermatology Clinic at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and voluntarily choose to participate in the study after being informed of the nature of the research. These patients complete a confidential survey assessing a change in sun exposure related activities immediately after their diagnosis. After they fill out the survey we will ask them if they could nominate a family member to whom we will explain the purpose of our research and confidentially ask an additional set of questions to evaluate the broader impact of a melanoma diagnosis. From our original sample we will randomly choose a few families who would display the survivor plaque in their primary bathroom. After six-twelve months during the patient's follow up visit will ask again both groups of patients and family members to fill out another survey to assess sun exposure related activity. On the surveys no names are recorded. Everything is anonymous.    ",NCT02457065

Melanoma,The Effects of Treatment With Vemurafenib on the Immune System in Advanced Melanoma, Approximately 40-60 % of cutaneous melanomas select for a mutation in a protein called BRAF which is part of a signaling pathway called the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway. When BRAF is mutated the MAPK pathway remains active allowing for melanoma to grow. Vemurafenib is an oral treatment which blocks the activity of BRAF which leads to decreasing the activity of the MAPK pathway. When patients with melanoma expressing specific mutation in BRAF are treated with vemurafenib approximately 50% will develop a response to treatment with shrinkage of tumor. When compared to a standard chemotherapy called dacarbazine used to treat melanoma treatment with vemurafenib leads to a statistically significant overall survival or living longer benefit. Because of this survival benefit vemurafenib was Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma expressing a BRAF mutation called V600E BRAF. There is increasing evidence that the immune system can also be important in affecting melanoma growth and survival and there are immune treatments FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. There is some limited evidence that blocking BRAF with vemurafenib may affect the activity of components of the immune system. It is important to better characterize and understand the effects of vemurafenib treatment on various components of the immune system. The purpose of this study is to systematically evaluate the effects of vemurafenib treatment (at FDA approved dosing regimen) on parts of the immune systems called the innate and adaptive immune systems. The hypothesis is that vemurafenib treatment will affect the immune system.    ,NCT01942993
Melanoma,Trial of Pembrolizumab and Radiotherapy in Melanoma, Around 13000 participants are diagnosed with melanoma in the UK each year and that number is growing quicker than any other cancer. About 20% of participants will see their cancer return following their initial treatment and at present would survive a median time of 912 months. In recent years the development of new effective drugs has revolutionised the treatment of advanced melanoma However response rates are still low and new therapeutic approaches are needed. This is a phase II study to look at the effectiveness and safety of the combination of a new drug called pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy compared to pembrolizumab alone. The purpose of this study is to see if the addition of radiotherapy to pembrolizumab is better than pembrolizumab alone by measuring how long these treatments can control the growth of the cancer. Also it will assess if by adding radiotherapy the investigators can see its effects not only in the tumour that has had radiotherapy but also in other tumours in the rest of the body.    ,NCT02562625
Melanoma,Phase II Study of Metastatic Melanoma With Lymphodepleting Conditioning and Infusion of Anti-MART-1 F5 TCR-Gene-Engineered Lymphocytes, Background:   -  Human peripheral blood lymphocytes have been engineered to express a T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes a blood typeHLA-A 0201 (human leukocyte antigen) derived from the gp100 protein. A retroviral vector was constructed that can deliver the T-cell receptor (TCR) to cells.   -  Patients' cells will be converted into cells able to recognize and fight melanoma tumors. Objectives:   -  To determine whether TCR-engineered lymphocytes can be put in cells removed from patients' tumors or blood and then reinfused with the purpose of shrinking tumors.   -  To evaluate safety and effectiveness of the treatment. Eligibility:   -  Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic cancer melanoma (cancer that has spread beyond the original site).   -  Patient's leukocyte antigen type is HLA-A 0201. Design: -Patients undergo the following procedures:   -  Leukapheresis (on two occasions). This is a method of collecting large numbers of white blood cells. The cells obtained in the first leukapheresis procedure are grown in the laboratory and the anti-MART-1 protein is inserted into the cells using an inactivated (harmless) virus in a process called retroviral transduction. Cells collected in the second leukapheresis procedure are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the study treatment.   -  Chemotherapy. Patients are given chemotherapy through a vein (intravenously IV) over 1 hour for 2 days to suppress the immune system so that the patient's immune cells do not interfere with the treatment.   -  Treatment with anti-melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART)-1. Patients receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of the treated cells containing anti-MART-1 protein followed by infusions of a drug called IL-2 (aldesleukin) which helps boost the effectiveness of the treated white cells.   -  Patients are given support medications to prevent complications such as infections.   -  Patients may undergo a tumor biopsy (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue).   -  Patients are evaluated with laboratory tests and imaging tests such as CT (computed tomography) scans 4 to 6 weeks after treatment and then once a month for 3 to 4 months to determine the response to treatment.   -  Patients have blood tests at 3 6 and 12 months and then annually for 5 years.    ,NCT00509288

The vaccine is repeated on day 30.   -  Group 3 receives anti-MART-1 F5 cells on day 0 followed by injections of low-dose IL-2 for 5 days (days 0-4).   -  Group 4 receives anti-MART-1 F5 cells on day 0 followed by MART-1 vaccine and low-dose IL-2 for 5 days. The vaccine is repeated on day 30.   -  Recovery: Patients are monitored closely and given medicines to prevent or treat any side effects of therapy.   -  Leukapheresis: Patients undergo leukapheresis at 1 and 3 months after therapy to collect cells to examine the effects of the treatment on the immune system.   -  Follow-up: Patients return to National Institutes of Health (NIH) 35 days after completing treatment and then at 3 months and every 6 months thereafter for evaluation with a physical examination review of side effects laboratory tests and scans. They have blood tests at 3 6 and 12 months after treatment and then once a year after that. A biopsy may be requested after treatment ends to examine the effects of treatment on the immune system. All patients return to NIH for a physical examination once a year for 5 years and then complete a follow-up questionnaire for another 10 years.    ,NCT00706992
Melanoma,Radiation Chemotherapy Vaccine and Anti-MART-1 and Anti-gp100 Cells for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Background:   -  Melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART-1) and gp100 are two genes found in melanoma cells. An experimental procedure developed for treating patients with advanced melanoma uses these genes and a type of virus to make special cells called anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells which are designed to destroy the patient's tumor. The cells are created in the laboratory using the patient's own tumor cells or blood cells.   -  The procedure also uses one of two vaccines-the anti-MART-1 peptide or the anti-gp100 peptide-to stimulate cells in the immune system that may increase the effectiveness of the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells. Both vaccines are made from a virus that is modified to carry a copy of the MART-1 gene or gp100 gene. The virus cannot cause disease in humans. Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells and peptide vaccines for treating patients with advanced melanoma. Eligibility: - Patients 18 years of age with metastatic melanoma for whom standard treatments including aldesleukin (IL-2) therapy to boost immune response have not been effective. Design:   -  Participants have an initial evaluation with complete medical history as well as scans x-rays and other tests as directed by researchers. Most of the treatments for this study will be given on an inpatient basis.   -  Before the treatment begins participants will undergo leukapheresis (removal of selected blood cells) to obtain cells for preparing the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells and for later stem cell transplantation.   -  Preinfusion treatment: 5 days of chemotherapy and 2 days of total-body irradiation to prepare the immune system for receiving the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells.   -  Infusion of cells followed by IL-2 treatment to improve immune response. IL-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion through a vein every 8 hours for a maximum of 15 doses (over 5 days).   -  After the cell infusion participants will be divided into two groups and will receive either the gp100 peptide or MART-1 vaccine given once a week for 3 weeks. Participants will also have stem cell transplantation (from previously collected stem cells) to promote cell survival.   -  Periodic follow-up clinic visits after hospital discharge for physical examination review of treatment side effects laboratory tests and scans every 1 to 6 months.    ,NCT00923195
Melanoma,Phase II Study of Short-Term Cultured Anti-Tumor Autologous Lymphocytes After Lymphocyte-Depleting Chemotherapy in Metastatic Melanoma, Background:   -  Most therapeutic therapies for metastatic melanoma have focused on the ability of T-cell lymphocytes to kill cells of tumors.   -  An adaptive cell transfer therapy has been pioneered in which cells are grown for a short time in the laboratory. The way they are grown may have a better effect in a patient's body than do other cells that are cultured for a longer time.

Melanoma,cKIT BRAF/NRAS Mutations in Advanced Melanoma : Clinical Outcome in Response to Tyrosine-kinase Inhibitors - KitMel Project, Background: Metastatic melanoma has a devastating prognosis and is one of the top causes of cancer death in young patients. Until now available therapies were few and unreliable but recent understanding of melanomas' molecular pathways has improve their classification and new clinical strategies have been proposed. Initial studies showed that B-Raf/N-Ras mutations (respectively V600E and Q61) are the most frequent alteration being present in 70 to 80% of melanomas characterizing non Chronic Sun-induced Damage skins (CSD). These include Superficial Spreading Melanomas (SSM) and Nodular Melanomas (NM). Other studies showed that c-Kit mutations are presently the predominant activating mutation (20 - 40 %) in Acro-Lentiginous Melanomas (ALM) Mucous Melanomas (MM) and in melanomas arising on CSD skin. c-Kit mutation pattern is more complex with four exons being affected leading to different mutations which incidence and biological impact are less documented. BRAF/NRAS genetics alterations drive constantly cell growth being thus attractive targets. Spectacular results have indeed been obtained with the BRAF inhibitor that targets the V600E BRAF-mutated form. Data from GIST disease revealed that the different c-Kit mutations modulate differently c-Kit function and the response to targeted therapies. Because c-Kit targeted therapy is a critical clinical issue the investigators aimed to identify the most frequent mutations present in our population to propose appropriate screening test and adapt the therapy. Methods: 250 melanoma samples corresponding to an homogeneous white-Caucasian population (Brittany France) will be screened. c-Kit exons 11 13 17 and 18 will be sequenced (direct sequencing and pyrosequencing when possible). c-Kit copy number will be quantified by q-PCR and level of c-Kit determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC CD117). Samples will also be analyzed for B-Raf mutations in codon 464 466 469 and 600 and for N-Ras mutations in codon 12 13 and 61 (Pyrosequencing). Expected Results: Taken together the investigators anticipate that the present genetic analysis of the tumours from patients with advanced melanoma will first document the type and frequency of cKit mutations will confirm or not that BRAF NRAS and cKit mutations are mutually exclusive and document their repartition in the melanomas sub-types. Finally this study will clue researchers in to how well patients will respond to a therapy that targets the growth-promoting proteins BRAF/NRAS and cKIT.    ,NCT01543113
Melanoma,Vaccination of Melanoma Patients With Dendritic Cells Loaded With Allogeneic Apoptotic-Necrotic Melanoma Cells, Background: Sixteen melanoma patients (1 stage IIC 8 stage III and 7 stage IV) were treated in a Phase I study to evaluate safety and immune responses with a vaccine (DC/Apo-Nec) composed of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with a mixture of apoptotic/necrotic melanoma cell lines (Apo-Nec). Methods: PBMC were obtained from leukapheresis and DCs were generated from monocytes cultured in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 in serum-free medium. Immature DCs (iDCs) were loaded with gamma-irradiated Apo-Nec cells and injected id without adjuvant. Cohorts of four patients were given four vaccines with 5 10 15 or 20 x106 DC/Apo-Nec per vaccine two weeks apart. Results: The vaccine was well tolerated in all patients. Toxicity to vaccine was mild and the toxicity-limiting dose has not been reached. We found that 42.3 ±13.7 % melanoma patients´ iDCs were able to phagocyte Apo-Nec cells wich induced DCs maturation as evidenced by increased expression of CD83 CD80 CD86 HLA class I and II compared to iDCs. Also after phagocytosis a 75.2 ±16 % reduction in Dextran-FITC endocytosis was observed compared to iDCs. CCR7 was upregulated upon Apo-Nec phagocytosis in DCs from all patients and accordingly in vitro DC/Apo-Nec cells were able to migrate towards MIP-3 beta. The DTH score increased significatively in the patients after the first vaccination and slightly decreased by the fourth vaccine (Mann-Whitney Test p<0.05). For patient #1 a positive DTH reaction was detected to her own tumor irradiated cells. The presence of CD8+ T lymphocytes specific to gp100 and Melan A/MART-1 Ags were studied by tetramers binding in HLA-A*0201 patients (7 /15 patients) before and after vaccination. Two patients who remain NED increased Ags their specific T lymphocytes after vaccination. No humoral responses to Apo-Nec cells were detected. With a mean follow-up of 44.5 months post-surgery the stage IIC pt is NED 7/8 stage III pts are NED and 7/7 stage IV patients have progressed. Conclussions: We conclude that DC/Apo-Nec vaccine is well tolerated it induces specific immunity against melanoma Ags and in stage III patients it may prolong disease-free survival affording protection from relapse in an adjuvant setting.    ,NCT00515983
Melanoma,Immunotherapy Using 41BB Selected Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Background: The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors growing them in the laboratory in large numbers and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 100 patients. In this study we are selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells. Objective: The purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can cause melanoma tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe. Eligibility: - Adults age 18-70 with metastatic melanoma who have a tumor that can be safely removed. Design:   -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination scans x-rays lab tests and other tests as needed   -  Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.   -  Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}   -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment. Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam review of side effects lab tests and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.    ,NCT02111863
Melanoma,Follow Up Protocol for Subjects Previously Enrolled in NCI Surgery Branch Studies, Background: The NCI Surgery Branch has developed experimental therapies that involve taking white blood cells from patients' tumor or from their blood growing them in the laboratory in large numbers and then giving the cells back to the patient. Objective: This study will allow patients to be followed for up to 15 years following treatment on an NCI Surgery Branch Gene Therapy Trial as required by the FDA. Eligibility: Patients must have been enrolled on an NCI Surgery Branch Gene Therapy Protocol Design Patients will be followed with a physical examination and blood tests for up to 15 years as required by the FDA    ,NCT00923026
Melanoma,Harvesting Cells for Experimental Cancer Treatments, Background: The NCI Surgery Branch has developed experimental therapies that involve taking white blood cells from patients' tumor or from their blood growing them in the laboratory in large numbers and then giving the cells back to the patient. Objective: This study will collect white blood cells from normal volunteers and white blood cells and/or tumor cells from patients who have been screened for and are eligible for a NCI Surgery Branch treatment protocol.

The cells and/or tumor from patients will be used to make the cell treatment product. Eligibility: Patients must be eligible for a NCI Surgery Branch Treatment Protocol Normal Volunteers must meet the criteria for blood donation Design Both patients and normal Volunteers will undergo apheresis. Patients will then undergo further testing as required by the treatment protocol. There is no required follow up for normal volunteers.    ,NCT00068003
Melanoma,In-hospital Neutron Irradiator (IHNI)-Based Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) in the Treatment of Malignant Melanoma, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) has been used in the treatment of several types of malignant tumors including malignant melanoma high-grade gliomas and advanced head and neck cancers. Theoretically it represents a more precise radiotherapy in that it could spare normal cells while destroy malignant ones. However its value is largely restricted by the fact that it could only be performed in the nuclear research reactors the only neutron source at the time. In 2010 the world's first in-hospital neutron irradiator (IHNI) had been constructed in Beijing China and this study aims to evaluate whether IHNI has the potential to serve as an effective in-hospital neutron source for BNCT.    ,NCT02759536

Subjects will receive 150 mg of GSK2118436 twice daily and continue on treatment until disease progression death or unacceptable adverse event.    ,NCT01153763
Melanoma,Immune Responses To Antigen-Bearing Dendritic Cells in Patients With Malignancy, Cancer cells make proteins called antigens that act as markers for the tumor cells. These antigens cannot cause the cancer itself. Special white blood cells called T cells or T lymphocytes recognize and respond to antigens. In many diseases these and other cells in the immune system help your body get rid of the disease. However T cells are normally resting and they need other proteins on the diseased cell surface to begin working. Unfortunately cancer cells do not usually make all the other proteins that T cells need to work. Therefore T cells do not normally work against the cancer cells. We think this is one of the reasons that cancers grow and are not rejected by the body in the first place. Another white blood cell called a dendritic cell does have most if not all of the special proteins needed to make T cells work to destroy cancer cells. However dendritic cells do not normally have the cancer proteins on their surface. The challenge then is to combine the cancer markers (antigens) with these dendritic cells to make a vaccine. We think that the body's T cells might then react against the tumor and help destroy it. This study will see if putting tumor antigens made in a lab onto dendritic cells will make T cells work against tumor cells. We want to answer this question by injecting you with dendritic cells loaded with the antigens. Then we will check for a response based on lab studies and your own clinical course. We will compare your response against melanoma with your response against a common antigen to which almost everyone has already been exposed. Flu for example is a common antigen to which most people have been exposed. We also need to test your response to an antigen that your body has not likely seen before. For example we plan to use KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) which is a pigment or color protein made from a sea creature known as a keyhole limpet. Each of these the flu and KLH antigens which should be harmless to you will be used along with the dendritic cell-tumor vaccine. This will help us find out if the vaccine is working based on the lab studies we will check before and after the vaccinations.    ,NCT00700167
Melanoma,Study of Circulating Tumor Cells Before and After Treatment in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are the subject of increasing interest in clinical oncology as a prognostic factor and predictor of therapeutic response. The detection of CTC by immunomagnetic method has proved its reliability and its usefulness for monitoring breast cancer colon and prostate in the metastatic and immunomagnetic detection system (CellSearch Veridex LLC) was approved by the FDA in these indications. However to date there is no reliable method to detect CTCs in melanoma (CMC). Studies based on PCR amplification of mRNA by reverse specific melanoma is disappointing. Recently a new detection system of CMC immunomagnetic was presented (CellSearch Veridex LLC United States). This system has the advantage of combining immunomagnetic selection step and a step of identifying by immunofluorescence. A preclinical study on serial dilutions of melanoma cells has shown encouraging results. The investigators propose a prospective study of the CellSearch system in patients with melanoma. Primary objective: To determine the effect of treatment on the number of circulating melanoma cells in patients with metastatic melanoma. Secondary objectives:   -  determine the percentage of patients with metastatic melanoma with melanoma cells circulating   -  seek a relationship between the number of circulating melanoma cells and prognosis in patients with metastatic melanoma   -  seek a relationship between the change in the number of circulating melanoma cells before / after treatment and tumor response in patients with metastatic melanoma    ,NCT01573494

Melanoma,Nivolumab Plus Radiotherapy in Advanced Melanoma, Combining nivolumab with conventional multisite high dose radiotherapy seems to be an interesting approach that could increase the antitumoral effect of nivolumab by increasing the diversity and quantity of tumoral antigen presentation thanks to radiotherapy. Multifractionated high dose radiotherapy (HR) targeting various tumor sites could also increase occurrence of tumor mutations and the diversity of the T-cell receptor repertoire of intratumoral T cells. The purpose of this study is to combine nivolumab with 3 fractions of HR of one metastasis for each tumor site (defined as skin/muscle thoracic abdomen bone other). The investigators hypothesize that combining nivolumab with multisite multifractionated HR increases the overall survival rate at 1 year compared to published data with nivolumab alone.    ,NCT02799901
Melanoma,A Clinical Trial of Adoptive Transfer With Autologous NKT Cells in Metastatic Melanoma Patients, Considerable progress in the treatment of metastatic melanoma has been made in the past 5years with the approval of immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies and agents targeting BRAF mutation.

Melanoma,Concurrent Dabrafenib and Trametinib With Sterotactic Radiation in Patients With BRAF Mutation-Positive Malignant Melanoma and Brain Metastases, Dabrafenib and trametinib are drugs that are usually given for the treatment of melanoma. Combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib have also been studied and when used together have shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone. Dabrafenib and trametinib have also shown potential to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier when given together and have an effect on brain metastases. Giving these drugs at the same time and then giving brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may also be preferred in patients with brain metastases    ,NCT02974803
Melanoma,Augmentation of Dendritic Cell-Based Vaccines in Melanoma Patients by Depletion of Regulatory T Cells in Stage IV Melanoma Patients, Dendritic cells (DC) are the professional antigen presenting cells of the immune system. Multiple distinct DC lineage's exist and it is now well appreciated that the DC subset and the maturation stage of the DC determines the type of immune response ranging from a TH1 or TH2 response to immune tolerance. The extremely potent capacity of mature DC to initiate immune responses can be exploited to fight infectious diseases and cancer. Others and we are currently using tumor antigen loaded mature DC in clinical vaccination studies against cancer and clinical as well as immunological responses have been observed. Exciting new insights accompany the revival of suppressor T cells now referred to as regulatory T cells (Treg) and implicate that also Treg play a key role in the control of immunity. Treg constitute a sub-population of CD4+ T cells constitutively expressing the IL-2R alpha-chain (CD25). Treg show remarkably suppressive activities on different components of the immune system including T lymphocytes and dendritic cells suggesting they act both at the initiation phase (DC) and at the effector phase (activated T cells) of the immune response. Interestingly temporal depletion of Treg has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and in case of prolonged absence of Treg even autoimmunity. Furthermore data in mouse tumor models indicate that temporal depletion of Treg also results in improved vaccine efficiency in the therapeutic setting e.g. in mice with a pre-existing tumor. These data imply that in tumor bearing patients depletion of Treg prior to vaccination will improve vaccine efficacy. In this study we investigate the effect of regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion on the efficacy of DC-based anti-tumor vaccines in a clinical study using melanoma associated antigens tyrosinase and gp100-loaded DC and a depleting anti-CD25 mononuclear antibody (Daclizumab). Our primary objective in this study is the induction of an effective anti-tumor immune response. Our secondary objective is the induction of a clinical response.    ,NCT00847106
Melanoma,Natural Dendritic Cell Vaccines in Metastatic Melanoma Patients, Dendritic cells (DCs) are the professional antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. As such they are currently used in clinical vaccination protocols in cancer patients and both immunological and clinical responses have been observed. Several subsets of dendritic cells have been characterized in the peripheral blood. One such subset is referred to as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) another as myeloid dendritic cells (myDC). To date PDC and myDC have not been evaluated for their capability to induce anti-tumor immune responses in patients. For this reason the investigators will perform a safety and efficacy study with PDC and myDC in stage IV melanoma patients.    ,NCT01690377
Melanoma,Pilot Study of Infrared Imaging of Cutaneous Melanoma, Design: this is a pilot study of infrared imaging of cutaneous lesions in patients and volunteers with and without clinically detectable melanoma and with one or more palpable cutaneous lesions eligible for this imaging study.

Melanoma,Use of Exome Sequence Analysis and Circulating Tumour in Assessing Tumour Heterogeneity in BRAF Mutant Melanoma, Despite recent advances in cancer treatment little impact has been made on curing as opposed to controlling cancers over the last several decades. Part of the problem is that investigators have an incomplete understanding of how tumours behave as they evolve and in response to treatment. In this trial the investigators hope to better understand the evolution of BRAF melanoma in response to drugs a patient may have received such as vemurafenib or dabrafenib. Importantly the investigators want to understand how the tumours evolve resistance to these drugs and whether this can be predicted through blood tests in particular of the circulating tumour DNA.    ,NCT02251314
Melanoma,Family Study of Melanoma in Italy, During the course of a case-control study of melanoma conducted at the Bufalini Hospital Cesena Italy in the years 1994-1996 20 families with 2 or 3 melanoma cases were identified and studied. The area where the study was conducted showed the steepest increase in melanoma incidence in Mediterranean populations between the years 1987 and 1997. Clinical characteristics of melanoma in the families studied were similar to those typically described in fair-skinned populations but no relevant mutations in the coding regions of known candidate genes from melanoma have been found. Lack of findings could be due to the modest number of families and the small number of affected CMM cases examined. We cannot exclude the possibility of alterations in introns splicing sites or promoter regions. Also epigenetic factors could affect the expression of the gene products we studied. Alternatively germline alterations of a gene(s) other than the candidate genes we analyzed may play an important role in melanoma predisposition in this population. A large number of families is needed to test these hypotheses. These additional families could provide an important contribution to the understanding o melanoma development. In fact this population does not generally have the host characteristics that are usually associated with higher risk for melanoma (e.g. light skin color red hair blue eyes multiple freckles tendency to sunburn etc.) but do have a relative high frequency of dysplastic nevi and melanoma. The main objective of this study is to recruit more families at the Bufalini Hospital Cesena Italy in order to reach a larger sample size. Recently 16 potential melanoma-prone families have been identified through patient's or physicians' referrals by the Dermatologists at the Bufalini Hospital. The dermatologists have maintained close relationships with members of these families and are confident that these subjects would be willing to participate in a study if contacted. The first goal of our study is to contact this family group and verify their willingness to participate in the study. In addition new families could be identified and recruited. We propose to conduct a pilot project. We estimate recruitment of approximately 25 families with 2 or more melanoma cases in first -degree relatives over a one-year period including the 16 families already identified and approximately 10 new kindreds. At the end of the pilot phase we will determine the feasibility of continuing recruitment.    ,NCT00339222
Melanoma,BrUOG 324: Adjuvant Nivolumab and Low Dose Ipilimumab for Stage III and Resected Stage IV Melanoma: A Phase II Brown University Oncology Research Group Trial, Effective adjuvant treatment can increase cure in patients with high-risk resected melanoma. High dose interferon is a standard of care in the adjuvant setting but is highly toxic and marginally effective. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab is the most active regimen in patients with advanced melanoma so there is clear rationale to test this regimen in the adjuvant setting. Investigators are testing if nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks with 1mg/kg ipilimumab every 6 weeks in the high risk adjuvant setting. The duration of therapy will be six months.    ,NCT02656706

Melanoma,Comparison of Two Strategies for Counseling Skin Examination and Sun Protection in First-degree Relatives of Patients With Melanoma, First-degree relatives of patients with melanoma have a greater risk of developing melanoma. Patients are advised orally to inform their first-degree relatives that they should protect their skin from UV radiation and ask for a skin examination from a general practitioner or dermatologist. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of a written sheet in addition to the usual oral counselling to increase acceptance of skin examination by the first-degree relatives. If effective written counselling provided to the patient for relatives should be recommended and generalized.    ,NCT02917473

These two isolates limb perfusions with melphalan are treated 3-6 weeks apart. After perfusion is established the leak rate has been determined to be acceptable and tissue temperatures are 38 degrees Celsius then the melphalan is administered by slow injection into an arterial line over approximately 5 minutes. The perfusion with melphalan will then continue for 60 minutes after which the extremity is flushed out with a total of 3 liters of fluid consisting initially of a saline solution. The dose of melphalan for the second perfusion will be increased. An attempt to resect the residual lesion between 6-12 weeks after the second interval perfusion may be made.    ,NCT00001577
Melanoma,Genetic Analysis of Familial Melanoma, In collaboration with members of The International Melanoma Consortium we propose to study melanoma in families lacking mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 (CDKN2 or p16) gene or the cyclin-dependant kinase 4 (CDK4). CDKN2 and CDK4 are both genes that encode presumed tumor suppressor genes mutant forms of which are known to cause increased susceptibility to melanoma. The purpose of the present study then is to confirm the existence of and to identify additional gene(s) involved in heritable melanoma (cutaneous and ocular) and their precursor lesions (atypical nevi) by linkage analysis and gene mapping strategies. It is clear that the risk to develop atypical nevi and/or melanoma is strongly influenced by genetic and environmental factors (e.g. sun exposure). Characterization of such genes could provide important insights into the inheritance pathogenesis and treatment of this increasingly important disease.    ,NCT00339404
Melanoma,Harmonics-based in Vivo Optical Virtual Biopsy, In our research the investigators use the non-invasive 1230 nm ultra-fast laser as the light source and utilize the non-linear light microscopic system to observe your skin. This microscopic system is successfully developed by the Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics National Taiwan University and has not been commercialized yet. In the past observations by this technology were performed on the skin of five subjects. The early stage of the skin clinical trial was approved by Research Ethics Committee of National Taiwan University Hospital. After the trial the tested sites of subjects were evaluated by a dermatologist immediately several hours 24 hours 3 days and 1 week. There were no inflammatory symptoms no skin color change no pigmentation no wound no blister formation and no ulceration reported. According to the subjects' experiences they felt no discomfort during the experiment. After the experiment there were no inflammatory symptoms and signs in the observed skin areas. Therefore the preliminary trial showed that this technology is safe for the subjects.    ,NCT01980264

Melanoma,18F-FLT PET Imaging in Patients With Advanced Melanoma," In the current study advanced positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging methods will be used to validate our hypothesis that melanoma patients receiving Dual-Immune Checkpoint Blockade (DICB) therapy who ultimately achieve clinical benefit will have an increase or ""FLARE"" in tumor FLT and/or FDG uptake from baseline as seen after cycle#1 of treatment and that after 2 cycles of treatment responders will have a decline in FLT and FDG uptake in comparison to the patients classified as ""non-responders"". In addition alterations in tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW/MRI) will be evaluated expecting after cycle#1: transient reductions in ADC due to lymphocyte proliferation increased cellularity and restriction of water movement in responding patients with these patients tumors having increased ADC at 2 cycles into therapy associated with tumor necrosis.

Melanoma,Targeted Intervention for Melanoma Prevention, In this study the researchers will conduct interviews with melanoma patients to describe the sun exposure and sun protection practices of patients and their children. The researchers will use the findings of this interview study to develop a salient intervention targeted to the needs of melanoma patients and their children. The researchers will evaluate the intervention in a randomized controlled trial. The specific aims of this study are:   -  To interview 210 melanoma patients with children 12 years of age or younger to describe patients' socio-cognitive and psychological factors describe patients' and children's sun exposure and sun protection practices and identify determinants of patients' and children's sun exposure and protective practices.   -  To develop a targeted behavioral intervention that is designed to increase patients' protective practices to reduce their children's sun exposure increase patients' self-protective practices decrease the sun exposure levels of patients and their children and positively influence socio-cognitive and psychological determinants of child-centered and self-protective practices.   -  To conduct a randomized controlled trial in a sample of 360 melanoma patients with children 12 years of age or younger to evaluate the targeted behavioral intervention consisting of print and video materials. The intervention will be assessed for its effects on: 1) child sun exposure and sun protection; 2) patients' protective practices to reduce their children's sun exposure; 3) patients' sun exposure and self-protective practices; and 4) patients' socio-cognitive and psychological factors that facilitate behavior change.    ,NCT00394134
Melanoma,Phase II Trial of Neoadjuvant Temozolomide in Melanoma Patients With Palpable Stage III or IV Disease Undergoing Complete Surgical Resection, In this study we want to find out how likely it is for temozolomide to shrink melanoma tumors that have spread only to areas that could be removed by surgery. We also want to study the melanoma before and after temozolomide treatment to learn why some tumors respond and others do not. This is a Phase II trial. This means that it will test a drug - in this case temozolomide -- that has already been studied and shown to be safe. Surgery when possible is the main treatment for patients with melanoma like yours. In most people however melanoma cells have already spread to other places in the body. This means that even with surgery many people will have the melanoma come back. This is often fatal. One goal of this trial is to treat the melanoma cells that might have spread before they have a chance to grow. As part of this trial we also study which genes are turned on and which genes are turned off in your tumor. We will obtain tumor from the biopsy done before you started temozolomide treatment and from the tumor removed during the surgery done after you finish temozolomide treatment. This may help us understand how temozolomide works and how to recognize which tumors will respond. Before and during the temozolomide treatment we will also test a new way of measuring the amount of tumor present. This involves a special way of analyzing the CT scan which you will have anyway. This new technique may allow us to see tumor shrinkage very early in the treatment course.    ,NCT00588341
Melanoma,Cognitive Effects of Interferon in Patients With Melanoma, Interferon alpha is the only approved adjuvant biologic therapy for individuals diagnosed with high risk malignant melanoma (stage 2 or 3). There is evidence that interferon has some adverse cognitive effects on patients but there are limited data. The investigators hypothesis is that compared to patients with melanoma who do not receive interferon patients who have melanoma and are treated with interferon will show an objective decrease in performance on neurocognitive assessment. This study will enroll patients with melanoma who qualify for interferon and either decide to undergo interferon treatment or choose watchful waiting instead. All patients will be assessed with a cognitive testing battery twice. Observation patients will undergo testing at their first appointment in which they consent to the study as well as at their next physician visit approximately 3 months from the first visit. Interferon patients will be tested immediately prior to starting interferon as well as immediately after completing high dose interferon.    ,NCT02074605

Melanoma,GEM STUDY: Radiation And Yervoy in Patients With Melanoma and Brain Metastases, Ipilimumab adds a clinical benefit to radiation therapy in patients with melanoma metastatic to the brain. Melanoma is the third most common cancer causing brain metastases after cancers of the lung and breast which appears to reflect the relative propensity of melanoma to metastasize to the central nervous system (CNS). Brain metastases are responsible for 20 to 54 percent of deaths in patients with melanoma and among those with documented brain metastases these lesions contribute to death in up to 95 percent of cases with an estimated median overall survival ranging between 1.8 and 10.5 months depending upon other prognostic factors. Ipilimumab is an anti-Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4) monoclonal antibody that has demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in overall survival either alone (second line) or in combination with dacarbazine (DTIC) in 1st line. Ipilimumab has shown activity against brain metastases. According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved label for Yervoy® the use of glucocorticoids at baseline (commonly prescribed when brain metastases are diagnosed) should be avoided before the administration of ipilimumab. Data show that the use of even high doses of glucocorticoids for the management of immune-related adverse events do not decrease the efficacy of Yervoy®. There is no documented experience on the efficacy of Yervoy® when given concomitantly with radiation therapy and glucocorticoids. In experimental models radiation therapy is synergistic to anti-Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4) strategies (abscopal effect). There are no published results from clinical trials on the interaction between radiation therapy and ipilimumab.    ,NCT02115139
Melanoma,Immunogenicity and Biomarker Analysis of Neoadjuvant Ipilimumab for Melanoma," Ipilimumab is a manufactured monoclonal antibody much like the antibodies usually made by the human body to fight off infection; however it is not known why the human body does not ""fight off"" a cancerous tumor. The idea behind developing this experimental drug is to stimulate the immune system to make antibodies to kill cancer cells. This research study is considered ""experimental"" because it has not received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of this type of cancer. This monoclonal antibody has been specifically made to block Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4) which is a protein found on cells of the immune system. CTLA4 seems to slow down the immune response so blocking it with an anti-CTLA4 antibody may make the immune response more active. The purpose of this study is to see if Ipilimumab affects the response of the patient's immune system toward their cancer.    ",NCT00972933
Melanoma,Identification of Marker of Primary or Acquired Resistance to Anti Tumorous Treatment, Lung Cancer and melanoma relapsed frequently whereas its very sensitive to treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

Melanoma,RTA 408 Capsules in Patients With Melanoma - REVEAL, Malignant melanoma is a leading cause of death from cutaneous malignancies accounting for approximately three-fourths of all skin cancer deaths. For metastatic or unresectable melanomas standard treatment options include immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. ipilimumab and nivolumab) and other therapies however approved therapies are rarely curative. It is now well accepted that tumors are able to evade detection and eradication by the immune system even though many tumor types particularly melanoma are capable of eliciting a strong immune response (Swann 2007). Substantial mechanistic work in recent years has revealed the key role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in masking cancer cells from the immune system promoting both tumor progression and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. The immune-suppressive effect of MDSCs is dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). High levels of these reactive molecules and their by-products such as nitrotyrosine have been correlated with poor clinical outcomes in melanoma. Currently available melanoma therapies do not target MDSCs. In animals RTA 408 significantly reduces tumor nitrotyrosine burden inhibits the activity of MDSCs and augments T-cell anticancer activity at relevant doses. Thus through inhibition of MDSC activity and suppression of tumor ROS/RNS RTA 408 may work in combination with T-cell-activating therapeutics such as ipilimumab to enhance the natural immune anticancer response. RTA 408 also has direct anticancer effects via inhibition of NF-kappa B. Chronic activation of NF-kappa B is associated with tumor progression metastasis and resistance to therapy. This proposed study is designed to assess the safety efficacy pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In this open-label multicenter dose-escalation Phase 1b/2 study patients who qualify will receive omaveloxolone (RTA 408) at the assigned dose level in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab. Patients will receive omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily for 1 week prior to initiation of ipilimumab or nivolumab. For patients treated with ipilimumab  the run-in period will be followed by omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily in combination with ipilimumab administered at Weeks 1 4 7 and 10. After Week 10 patients will receive maintenance treatment with omaveloxolone (RTA 408) alone once daily. For patients treated with nivolumab the run-in period will be followed by omaveloxolone (RTA 408) orally once daily in combination with nivolumab administered approximately every two weeks as clinically indicated. Each patient will continue at the assigned omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose level until disease progression occurs toxicity requiring discontinuation from study drug (i.e. RTA 408) is experienced the patient has completed approximately 72 weeks of treatment the patient is discontinued from the study drug for another reason or the patient withdraws consent. Patients will return 4 weeks after omaveloxolone (RTA 408) treatment completion for a follow-up visit. The starting omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose level for the first dose-escalation cohort in this study has been selected based on available safety and pharmacodynamic data from a Phase 1 study of RTA 408 (NCT02029729). Subsequent cohorts will be enrolled at dose levels based on available safety and PD data from this study but they will not be greater than 2-fold above the prior dose level. Phase 1b (dose-escalation): In the phase 1b/2 portion of this study 12 patients will be enrolled in each dose cohort with six patients administered omaveloxolone (RTA 408) plus ipilimumab and the remaining six administered rTA 408 plus nivolumab. Subsequent cohorts will assess escalating the doses of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) administered in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab. Dose escalation decisions will be based on ongoing review of all available safety information for enrolled patients. Phase 2: The Phase 2 portion of the study may include separate expansion cohorts consisting of patients treated with either of the combination therapies. Each expansion cohort will include an additional 24 patients enrolled at the selected Phase 2 dose level to achieve a total of 30 patients at that omaveloxolone (RTA 408) dose in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab.    ,NCT02259231

Melanoma,Feasibility and Functionality of fPAM Imaging in Melanoma, Melanoma is a cutaneous malignancy that has the potential for local (skin) and regional (lymph node) recurrence. These recurrences may be difficult to detect in their earliest stages. We are attempting to use novel form of skin imaging that uses ultrasound combined with laser to identify these recurrences early when they may be most amenable to treatment. This imaging will detect melanoma pigment below the surface of the skin and in the draining lymph nodes as well as new blood vessel formation that occurs with these loco-regional metastases.    ,NCT00776945
Melanoma,Sub-Tenon Triamcinolone in the Prevention of Radiation-Induced Macular Edema, Melanoma is the most common primary tumour which occurs inside the eye. For over 20-years it has been possible in many cases to use local delivery of radiation to the eye to treat this type of tumour avoiding the need to surgically remove the affected eye. This treatment however is often complicated by radiation-induced loss of vision months or years after treatment. The aim of this research project is to investigate the potential prevention of radiation complications in the eye by giving anti-inflammatory medication (a long-acting steroid) in the form of a local injection around the eye at the time of treatment and at 4-months and 8-months following treatment. This medication (named ?triamcinolone?? has been successfully used to treat similar complications of diabetic eye disease for example and has a good safety profile. The rationale of this study is to attempt to preserve vision in addition to preserving the eye in patients affected by this eye tumour and therefore preserve quality of life for these patients.    ,NCT00441662

Melanoma,PegIntron Versus IntronA in CMAJCC Stage II (EADO 2001/CMII Trial), Melanoma with a tumor thickness >= 1.5mm without clinically detectable nodes represents an increasing population with relapse rate of more than 50%. Adjuvant therapy with low doses of IFN alpha can provide a benefit in this group. However the impact of low dose IFN alpha is not sustained after the treatment period. A longer treatment may prolong the benefit and thus have a more clear-cut impact on disease-free and overall survival. The tolerance and the impact on quality of life are limiting factors in a group of patients whose individual course is not necessarily poor. PegIntron may be better tolerated than instant release interferon and thus make this treatment more acceptable in terms of toxicity and quality of life. Thus treatment schedule with PegIntron is not expected to increase the cost of standard care significantly.    ,NCT00221702

Melanoma,A Phase II Study of Isolated Hepatic Perfusion (IHP) in Patients With Ocular Melanoma, Ocular melanoma or cancer of the eye is a rare form of cancer that can spread to the liver. A tumor in the liver because of its size or location sometimes cannot be removed with surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine whether chemotherapy delivered only to the liver called isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) followed by systemic (to the whole body) chemotherapy improves the ability to treat cancer. Study participants must be 18 years or older and have ocular melanoma that has spread to the liver. Before enrolling in the study they will undergo the following evaluations: a physical exam; x-rays; blood tests; electrocardiogram; computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis; and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the liver. The study includes a 15-minute quality-of-life questionnaire. Participants will complete the questionnaire 7 times over a period of 2 years to help investigators gauge their health status and progress. A laparotomy is done which allows a surgeon to view the tumor in the liver through a small incision in the abdomen while the patient is under general anesthesia. Sometimes the tumor can spread outside the liver in a way that cannot be seen by pre-operative scans. When this happens the participant is ineligible to continue in the study since an important part of the treatment is given only to the liver. If the laparotomy reveals that the participant is eligible for the remainder of the study the participant will receive IHP treatment during the surgery. Plastic tubes called catheters are placed in the vein and artery that feed and drain the liver. This creates a separate blood supply for the liver alone. Heated chemotherapy is then given into the liver blood supply for one hour while being carefully kept out of the rest of the body. After recovering from the surgery eligible participants will receive a systemic chemotherapy called temozolomide for up to one year. This chemotherapy is taken by mouth in capsule form. Participants will be asked to return to NIH 10-11 times during the first year to evaluate their progress.    ,NCT00062933
Melanoma,Study Assessing Two Models of Hypofractionated Protontherapy on Large Choroidal Melanomas," Ocular melanomas have been treated for a long time by enucleation with an unfavorable major impact on the patient's quality of life social life self-image how they feel about others and about living with this disability. As a matter of fact classical radiation therapy by photons is not accurate enough to deliver a sufficiently high dose to eradicate a melanoma without causing irreversible ocular brain complications since these tumors are "" relatively radio resistant "". The possibility of delivering high doses due to the precision of protons (""Bragg peak"") has allowed to overcome this limitation. The conservative uveal melanoma treatment has become a standard after the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) indicating an equivalent rate of metastases and a non-impaired survival rate with a conservative treatment when compared to immediate enucleation. The quality of life benefits due to a conservative treatment has been demonstrated. Protontherapy dose has been defined in an empirical manner it is probably excessive even if it applies to radio-resistant tumors. In France radiotherapy by protons for choroidal melanomas delivers a dose of 60 Gy cobalt equivalent (that is 52 measured Gy or "" Physical dose"") in 4 fractions and 4 days. Referential treatment of ocular melanomas (other than conjunctiva) indicates proton-therapy for T1 T2 T3 < 40% of ocular volume and T4 only if extra scleral extension ??2mm. However there is an enucleation indication for T3 > 40% of ocular volume and T4. Our purpose is to override this relative contraindication choroidal melanoma volume ??40% of ocular volume. As a matter of fact the investigators observe an increasing demand from ophthalmologists and patients for not performing primary enucleation. Also during the last five years treatment of complications have improved and a less "" hard "" hypo fractionation (6.5 Gy per fraction) has equivalent local control results as for "" hard "" fractionation (13 Gy per fraction).

Melanoma,Videoscopic Versus Open Inguinal Lymphadenectomy for Cancer," Patients with melanoma some other rare skin cancers and some cancers of the penis and scrotum can have their cancer spread to the lymph nodes in the upper part of the leg called the groin. Medically this area is called the inguinal area. At present for melanomas and skin cancers this type of spread is usually found with a special test called a ""sentinel lymph node biopsy"". This procedure can find spread of even a few cells in a single lymph node?allowing the treating doctor to find the spread very early. Treatment for patients with skin cancer in the lymph nodes in this area is to remove all of the lymph nodes in this area. In patients with cancers of the penis and scrotum who do hot have any evidence of cancer having spread either by physical examination or by radiology tests the lymph nodes in this area are removed to check and see if there is cancer in them. This is called staging. At present the standard way to remove all of the lymph nodes in the groin is by a large incision approximately 8-10 inches in length. For patients who have this operation there is a very high incidence of infection after surgery: as many as 50% as patients can have a problem after surgery. These infections range from a low grade skin infection needing oral antibiotics to deep infections requiring the wound to be opened and occasionally needing readmission to the hospital and antibiotics given via the vein. With the advent of new technology and new equipment the ability to perform this procedure through small incisions away from the groin and further down the leg has become possible. This procedure has never been performed routinely nor compared side by side to the standard open approach. The investigators propose to perform this protocol in two phases. The investigators have performed procedures in 20 groins to this point and have confirmed the number of lymph nodes and visually verified that the procedure is identical to the open procedure. The investigators performed these procedures in order to insure that the investigators were offering an equivalent option regardless of which procedure the patient is randomized to. The study will involve the randomization of patients undergoing the procedure. The investigators will randomize the next 110 patients in a 2:1 fashion (two people will get the videoscopic procedure for every one who gets the open procedure) until 73 patients are included in the video arm and 37 in the open arm. Outcomes including recurrence rate duration of drain requirements and incidence of lymphedema will be followed. Patients will be followed using standard of care processes including regular office visits physical exams and radiographic imaging when indicated. Patients will be followed for 5 years.

Melanoma,M-Vax + Low Dose Interleukin-2 Versus Placebo Vaccine in Metastatic Melanoma in Patients With Stage IV Melanoma, Previous studies suggests that M-Vax a melanoma vaccine prepared from patients own cancer cells can stimulated patients' immune system to react against their cancer. AVAX has identified a dose and schedule of administration of M-Vax that work optimally. In this study AVAX will determine whether M-Vax is effective in shrinkage of melanomas that have spread (stage IV). To increase it effectiveness M-Vax administration will be followed by administration of low doses of interleukin-2 (IL2) a marketed drug that is known to stimulate immunity and cause some shrinkage of melanomas. Two-thirds of patients will receive M-Vax + IL2 and one-third will receive a placebo vaccine + IL2. The study is blinded so that neither the patients nor their physicians know which material they are receiving. To be eligible for this study patients must have at least one melanoma tumor that can be surgically removed and made into a vaccine. In addition they must have melanoma that has spread to to the lungs or to soft tissue sites (under the skin on the surface of the skin lymph nodes). Eligible patients may have previously received one treatment (for example chemotherapy) for their melanoma. Side effects of M-Vax are expected to be mild; the most common is the development of sore pimples at the site of vaccine injections. The low dose IL2 may cause some fatigue and other mild symptoms. It is expected that 387 patients will be treated in this study.    ,NCT00477906

Melanoma,MicroRNA Expression and Function in Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma, Spectrophotometric intracutaneous analysis (SIAscopy) is a new technique for imaging pigmented skin lesions and for diagnosing melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. The SIAscope is a portable system comprising of a laptop computer connected to a small handheld skin probe equipped with a light source. The skin lesion is interrogated with light of different wavelengths and the reflection spectra analysed by proprietary algorithms showing distribution position and quantity of melanin blood and collagen within the papillary dermis (the SIAgraphs). Earlier studies generated promising results and documented >80% specificity and sensitivity of SIAscopy for melanoma diagnosis. It has been suggested that this technique could be used for the initial screening and selection of pigmented lesion for excision. In this work we addressed the usefulness of SIAscopy for the clinical diagnosis of pigmented malignant melanoma in a prospective blinded design.    ,NCT00536029
Melanoma,STA-9090(Ganetespib) in Patients With Unresectable Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma, STA9090 is a drug which inactivates or blocks the work of a protein called Heat Shock Protein 90 or HSP90. HSP90 is a protein that helps some molecules inside your cells to have the right shape. By stopping HSP90's activity those molecules never get to have the right structure of be functional and they are destroyed. The investigators believe that if they stop the activity of HSP90 the rapidly dividing cells that are in your tumor(s) may slow down.

Melanoma,IL2 Imaging in Metastatic Melanoma, T cell infiltration of tumor lesions is a known prognostic factor in several tumor types and is used as treatment mechanism in some of these tumor types. In metastatic melanoma treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors induces clinical benefit in about 30-50% of the patients. These immune-based therapies are however accompanied by serious immune-related adverse events and high costs. Tumor infiltrating T cells express the high affinity interleukin-2 (IL2) receptor on their surface. These T cells could therefore be visualized by molecular imaging with a radio-labelled ligand for this receptor. For this purpose the investigators have developed the PET tracer [18F]FB-IL2. The study commences with a biodistribution study (phase 1) in 5 subjects. Thereafter the main study (phase 2) starts in which 25 subjects will receive two [18F]FB-IL2 PET scans at baseline and week 6 of treatment with either ipilimumab nivolumab pembrolizumab or the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab. If [18F]FB-IL2 PET is able to detect a response to treatment it could serve as a non-invasive early indicator of T cell response to the treatment. Besides accumulation of the PET tracer in non-target tissue could indicate infiltration of activated T cells in normal organs and thus may predict the development of an immune-related adverse event.    ,NCT02922283
Melanoma,Phase II Trial of Extended-Dosing Temozolomide in Patients With Melanoma, Temozolomide (also known as TMZ) is a chemotherapy drug given by mouth. It is similar to DTIC the only FDA-approved chemotherapy for melanoma but because temozolomide is given by mouth it can be given daily over a long period of time. We think that temozolomidemay work best if it is given every day for 6 weeks at a time. Temozolomide given by this extended schedule is experimental although we have found that it is safe and can shrink melanoma in some patients. One big advantage of TMZ is that it is given by mouth instead of by vein. This means that it can be given daily over a long period of time rather than off and on like DTIC. We think that TMZ may work better if it is given every day for 6 weeks. TMZ given by this extended schedule is experimental although we have found that TMZ given in this way is safe and can shrink melanoma in some patients. When extended dosing TMZ was given with either thalidomide or long-acting interferon-α about 30% of patients had their tumors shrink. We think that this shrinkage was due mostly to the TMZ since neither thalidomide nor interferon-α alpha work in melanoma by themselves. In this study we will treat patients with TMZ alone using this extended dosing schedule to see how many patients experience tumor shrinkage. We also want to learn more about which tumors are more likely to shrink from TMZ treatment. We will test samples of your tumor for whether or not a gene called MGMT has been turned on    ,NCT00591370

Melanoma,Patients With Mouse Tyrp2 DNA: A Phase I Trial to Assess Safety and Immune Response, The goal of this study is to find out about the safety of injecting the gene (DNA) for mouse TYRP2 in patients with melanoma. DNA is a material that contains the information needed to produce many substances in the body. TYRP2 is a substance found in melanoma cells that helps to produce their black color. The DNA used in this study is the gene for mouse TYRP2. The gene is introduced into bacteria which are grown in large quantities. The DNA vaccine is then made from bacteria that is inactive. We would like to see if we can immunize patients against TYRP2 by injecting mouse TYRP2 DNA. We will also follow the patients closely to see if there are any side effects. Mouse TYRP2 DNA is very similar to human TYRP2 DNA. We believe based on lab experiments that injection of mouse TYRP2 DNA could result in the production of immune substances (antibodies and T cells) that recognize melanoma cells. Antibodies are substances produced by your immune system to defend your body against bacteria and viruses. T cells are a type of white blood cell that can also fight infections. The small differences between mouse and human TYRP2 may allow your immune system to make the antibodies and T cells against melanoma. There is no evidence yet that injection of TYRP2 DNA results in any clinical benefit in patients.    ,NCT00680589

DNA damage is one of the first steps in developing cancer. Each person has many ways to repair normal damage to their genes. Some people may have a lower level of this repair and that may make them more likely to get cancer. Some genes are important for DNA repair. The genes we want to test are thought to affect the rate at which DNA can be repaired. We also want to find out if sun habits are related to these levels of DNA repair or genetic mutations.    ,NCT00615095

Melanoma,Study of Anti-telomerase T CD4 Immunity in Melanoma, The impressive clinical responses obtained with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1/PDL-1 anti-CTLA-4) indicate that the presence of preexisting antitumor immune response might be required for their efficacy and highlight the critical role of antitumor T cell immunity. Recent progresses on the field of tumor immunology underline the critical role of CD4 helper 1 T lymphocyte (TH1) in the control of innate and adaptive anticancer immunity. Therefore monitoring tumor specific TH1 response could be relevant in cancer patients. In order to monitor tumor-specific CD4 Th1 responses in most cancer patients the investigators team have previously described novel promiscuous peptides (referred as UCP: Universal Cancer Peptides) derived from human telomerase (TERT) a prototype of shared tumor antigen. By using UCP-based immuno-assay UCP specific Th1 immune responses will be evaluated in this study in melanoma before and after treatment.    ,NCT02838433
Melanoma,Safety Study of Adjuvant Vaccine to Treat Melanoma Patients, The incidence of melanoma is increasing with an estimated incidence of 59940 cases and an annual death rate of 8110 in 2007. Although patients diagnosed with early stage disease have an excellent clinical outcome patients diagnosed with advanced or recurrent disease continue to have a high mortality rate even with initial optimal surgical resection. Effective adjuvant strategies are needed to increase the time to progression and to decrease the recurrence rate. Immunotherapy has long been recognized as a potential therapy for melanoma; the goal of adjuvant vaccine therapy is to train the endogenous immune system to recognize and target minimal residual disease.    ,NCT01079741

Melanoma,Infrared Lymphangiography as a Method of Sentinel Node Identification, The initial treatment for most people with melanoma involves wide excision of the skin and sentinel node biopsy. As with other cancers the status of the sentinel node provides important prognostic information to the patient and physician. Sentinel node biopsy was first developed using only a blue dye. Technetium99 a radioactive protein was added later and provides the ability to image the patient and identify relevant lymph node basins. For the last 15 years or so the standard method of SLN localization includes both tech99 and blue dye. While the rates of localization overall are excellent these methods each have drawbacks. We are investigating a new method of finding sentinel nodes that uses a green dye that has an infrared signal. Our hypothesis is that indocyanine green (ICG) and real time lymphangiography is equivalent to technetium99 and methylene blue in identifying sentinel nodes (SLN) in patients with melanoma.    ,NCT02057393
Melanoma,Intralesional Treatment With Interleukin-2 (Proleukin) in Soft Tissue Melanoma Metastases, The intra-/perilesional application of interleukin-2 seems to be a safe and effective treatment of skin and soft tissue metastases in malignant melanoma. Especially in case of intransit metastases the overall survival rate is still 20-30%. However the management of intransit metastases is sometimes difficult because of frequent recurrences. IL-2 intralesionally seems to be an non-invasive option as pilot studies indicate. In this study the safety and efficacy of IL-2 are evaluated.    ,NCT00204581

Melanoma,Phase IIB TL + YCWP + DC in Melanoma," The majority of melanoma vaccines tested to date have been antigen-specific vaccines targeting melanoma-specific or associated antigens and utilizing a variety of delivery systems and immune-adjuvants. As opposed to testing an ""off the shelf"" vaccine that might be able to treat a subset of patients our approach has been personalized to the patient and applicable to all patients. Our vaccine approach consists of harnessing the most potent antigen presenting cell in the body - the dendritic cell (DC) - together with the full repertoire of tumor antigens from an individual's cancer. We have conducted phase I and II studies using an autologous DC-tumor cell fusion technique that has now been simplified into a DC-tumor cell lysate vaccine. The autologous tumor lysate (TL) is loaded into yeast cell wall particles (YCWP) that are naturally and efficiently taken up into the patient's DC. These autologous tumor lysate particle-loaded DC (TLPLDC) are injected intradermally (ID) monthly x 3 followed by boosters at 6 12 and 18 months.    ",NCT02301611

Melanoma,Pilot Study of IFN α2b for Melanoma Patients, The presence of malignant cells in lymph nodes is a critical parameter in the staging of melanoma cancer patients. Assessment of lymph nodes is currently done by histopathology alone. The long-term survival of melanoma cancer patients who have Stage IB disease (no known lymph node involvement with a tumor greater than 2 cm) is lower than patients who are Stage IA (no known lymph node involvement with a tumor less than 2 cm). Likewise the survival rates of patients who are judged to be Stage II based on histologically positive level-one lymph nodes is often no better than that of higher stage patients who have level-two lymph node involvement. These observations suggest that micrometastases are often present in lymph nodes that are not detectable by histological assessment. The collection of Sentinel Lymph Nodes (SLN) and non SLN material outlined in this proposal will permit both targeted and exploratory studies without compromising the patient's diagnosis on specimens that represent central engines of the immune response and whose function in the context of tumor progression is largely unknown. With the advent of an array of new methodologies that utilize minimum material for both molecular and cellular assessments acquiring up to 20% and in general the investigators anticipate the use of 5% on average of SLN and/or non SLN tissue for research purposes may prove to be critical to understanding the impact of nodal tumor involvement on patient outcome and survival.    ,NCT00871533

Melanoma,Trial of SBRT With Concurrent Ipilimumab in Metastatic Melanoma, The prognosis of advanced metastatic melanoma remains poor although a breakthrough has been achieved with the novel anti-CTLA-4 treatment (ipilimumab) for a subset of patients. Unfortunately due to immune resistance the majority of patients do not obtain long-lasting clinical benefit. Radiotherapy is able to interfere with immune resistance by inducing immunogenic cell death. Preclinical evidence indicates that combining radiotherapy with anti-CTLA-4 treatment increases response rates compared to single agent treatment. These data are supported by several spectacular clinical cases and one retrospective study. The investigators hypothesize that combining ipilimumab with radiotherapy will result in a higher response rate compared to ipilimumab or radiotherapy in monotherapy. Given the complexity of the interaction in anti-tumor immunity the first goal of this project is to assess the safety of the combined treatment.    ,NCT02406183
Melanoma,Phase I/II Study of Vaccination With Antigen Loaded Dendritic Cells (DCs) in Patients With Inoperable Stage III and Stage IV Melanoma, The prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma is poor and current available treatments are limited. Identification of a number of melanoma-specific tumor antigens that are shared by tumors from different patients provides attractive targets for immune-based therapies (http://www.bioinfo.org.cn/hptaa/). Different approaches like DNA-/RNA-vaccines peptide vaccines and dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are under investigation to induce peptide-specific immune responses. In various animal models and in clinical trials it was shown that the most potent induction of anti tumor-specific killer cells was achieved with DC vaccination. DCs are professional antigen presenting cells (APC) that are critical in the initiation of cellular responses in naïve T lymphocytes in vivo. They are armed with all the molecules needed for the induction of immune responses and have the capacity to migrate into secondary lymphatic organs. In vitro generated dendritic cells are loaded with tumor derived peptides and injected subcutaneously. The concept is to induce or to propagate already existing tumor specific killer T cells.    ,NCT01944709

Melanoma,A Pilot Study of Trientine With Vemurafenib for the Treatment BRAF Mutated Metastatic Melanoma," The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of combination therapy with vemurafenib and trientine in patients with BRAF mutated metastatic melanoma. Vemurafenib is a drug that is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to treat adult patients with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. It can only be used in patients whose cancer has a change (mutation) in the ""BRAF"" gene. Preclinical data suggests that use of a copper chelator (reducer) is a strategy to block cellular signaling activity which would result in anti-tumor effects (slow tumor growth). Trientine is a copper chelator and is FDA approved for the treatment of Wilson's disease (a disease of copper metabolism) and is generally well tolerated. It works by binding to copper to help remove it from the body. Trientine is not FDA approved for the treatment of melanoma and its use in this study is investigational. ""Investigational"" means the study drug is still being tested in research studies. All patients will receive vemurafenib at 960mg PO twice daily with continuous dosing in combination with trientine in escalating doses. The dose of trientine will depend on what portion of the study. In order to participate in the study patients must test positive for the change (mutation) in the BRAF gene.    ",NCT02068079

Melanoma,Phase II Trial Of ZK-EPO (ZK 219477) (Sagopilone) In Metastatic Melanoma, The purpose of this study is to find out how effective an investigational drug named ZK-Epo is against melanoma. Although ZK-Epo has been studied in the treatment of cancer it is not approved for use in treating melanoma. This research is being done because currently there are only a limited number of treatment options for patients who have melanoma that has spread to distant organs. We expect each patient to be in this study for at least 2 cycles. One cycle lasts for 21 days. If their tumor does not grow after 2 cycles and they do not have any major side-effects they may receive up to 6 cycles of ZK-Epo. If after they have received 6 cycles of ZK-Epo and their doctor determines that the tumor is continuing to shrink they will continue treatment with ZK-Epo. The number of treatments the patient receives after 6 cycles will depend upon when their doctor feels there has been maximum tumor response (tumor shrinkage). Two treatments will be given beyond what their doctor considers the point of maximum shrinkage. We estimate that they will spend anywhere from 1 1/2 months to 5 months taking part in this study.    ,NCT00598507

Melanoma,Randomized Study Comparing Two Dosing Schedules for Hypofractionated Image-Guided Radiation Therapy, The purpose of this study is to find out which way of giving high-dose radiation works best for treatment of cancer that has spread to bone the spine soft tissue or lymph nodes. This study will look at the effects good and/or bad of giving 27 Gy in three fractions (3 days) or 24 Gy in one fraction (1 day) using image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT). IG-IMRT is radiation that is given directly to the cancer site and reduces the exposure to normal tissue. Currently there are no studies that compare the effects of giving radiation in either hypofractionated doses (higher total doses of radiation spread out over several treatment days) or a single-fraction dose (entire radiation dose given in one treatment session). The patient may be asked to participate in an additional part of this study where we will get a a (DW/DCE) MRI before treatment start and within one hour after radiation treatment. If the patient is asked to take part in this portion of the study all they will need to do is get up to 3 MRIs with standard contrast injection. The purpose of this is to see if as a result of the treatment there are changes in the blood flow going to the cancer which could suggest that the treatment may be successful. In addition some patients can present new lesions and may be asked if they would like to have these new lesions treated on the protocol. If they are given this option this will not extend their follow up period. The follow up of the new lesions will match with the prior follow up dates.    ,NCT01223248

Melanoma,Dose-seeking and Efficacy Study of Pembrolizumab Plus Vemurafenib Advanced Melanoma, The study plans to treat patients with pembrolizumab and thus blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis would render tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor parenchyma more functional as a consequence of BRAF inhibition such that T cell activation by BRAFi would not be dampened by the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. This combination would reverse dysfunction among T cells in the tumor parenchyma maximizing T cell mediated immune anti-tumor efficacy. Progression free survival (PFS) with pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-001 was 57% at 6 months and 46.4% in the more recently reported phase III trial. PFS with vemurafenib treatment in BRIM-3 was ~50% at 6 months. Combined treatment with pembrolizumab and vemurafenib for BRAF mutant melanoma is hypothesized to be safe and to improve the PFS compared to these recent historical controls. Because this combination has not yet been tested and because the primary objective is to assess safety the investigators are staging accrual in the first phase of the trial. The study aims to accrue up to 50 patients to the mTPI design of this study with the expectation that there will be at least 30 patients treated at RP2D. In case there are less than 30 patients on the RP2D additional patients will be accrued.

Melanoma,Melanoma Molecular Profiling Analysis, There is a significant need to develop new and more effective ways to treat melanoma that will decrease patient morbidity and mortality. This protocol intends to collect and process a portion (< 20% of any node) of lymph nodes from melanoma patients undergoing routine surgical SLN resection: the SLN(s) and 1 adjacent non-SLN(s) are planned for study. In addition blood will be drawn at the pre study visit (serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and appropriate lineage control tissue will be collected. Material only from already-indicated and planned procedures as part of standard medical care will be used. The main goal of this study will be to properly collect and process material to be analyzed and explore the molecular features melanoma biological samples.    ,NCT00889980
Melanoma,Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy in Malignant Melanoma," Thermotherapy is a technology aiming at destroying tissue for example tumor tissue. Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherpy (imILT) is a specific form of thermotherapy which in addition to destroying tumor tissue has been optimized to cause a tumor specific immunologic response. In laboratory animals the imILT method has also been shown to induce a so called abscopal effect. This means that when one tumor is treated with imILT other untreated tumors also decrease in size. The immunologic response has previously been characterized in breast cancer patients after receiving imILT treatment  and presumed abscopal effects induced by imILT have also been described in a malignant melanoma patient. The purpose of this trial is to investigate the functionality and safety of the imILT treatment method in patients diagnosed with malignant melanoma. The inflammatory process following on the treatment will also be described in order to provide a more in depth knowledge of the treatment for this indication. The purpose is also to evaluate efficiency when it comes to local tumor destruction as well as understanding of the subsequent immunological effects. Since immunologically based treatment of malignant melanoma is under intense review with so called ""immune checkpoint inhibitors"" this trial will also provide valuable information on how imILT in the future could be combined with these new and for some patients very effective treatment regimens. The treatment method has successfully been used for treatment of patients with breast cancer and malignant melanoma . Treatment of breast cancer patients caused an increase of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the treated tumor as well as activated dendritic cells at the tumor border. Regulatory T lymphocytes decreased in the regional lymph nodes. This trial is explorative prospective open and non-randomized. Five malignant melanoma patients stage III - IV will be treated in this trial which is estimated to be carried out during a time period of 12 months.    ",NCT02650492
Melanoma,Molecular Epidemiology of Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma, This case-control study was planned to investigate the link of solar radiation with gene damage host factors and DNA repair proficiency in cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) risk. The hypothesis was that impaired DNA repair proficiency is associated with an increased risk of CMM due to unrepaired DNA damage particularly in subjects with dysplastic nevi poor tanning ability or genetic susceptibility. The study was reviewed as an RO1 Grant from the National Cancer Institute in 1995. Subject enrollment which included clinical evaluation epidemiologic questionnaires and skin and blood sample collection was completed in 1999 on approximately 180 melanoma cases and 180 controls identified in Italy. The study protocol and consent form both included the measurement of genetic and biochemical factors and DNA repair capacity. DNA repair proficiency was measured in lymphocytes by the host cell reactivation assay and sun exposure was evaluated by means of a detailed questionaire. Photographs of the back of the subjects were taken to allow nevi count. Minimal erythemal dosage was measured in all subjects to estimate skin sun sensitivity 24 hours after skin's UV-irradiation. Skin color was ascertained on the inner side of the forearm by means of a Minolta chromometer. The aim of this protocol is to continue analysis of the biological samples already collected as originally outlined in the study protocol. In particular we plan to measure polymorphisms in genes that may lead to susceptibility to melanoma. Initially we will concentrate on variation in genes involved in repairing damaged DNA but plan to look at a broad group of candidate susceptibility genes.    ,NCT00341991

After the vaccines subjects will be randomized to either receive a boost of high dose IFN or no boost. IFN will be administered intravenously (into a vein) for 5 consecutive days (Monday through Friday) every week for 4 weeks. Administration will begin approximately 30 days (± 7 days) after the 3rd vaccine. The first dose of IFNα2b may begin within 10 business days of randomization. All subsequent procedure dates for Group A will be based on the date of the first dose of IFNα2b.    ,NCT01622933
Melanoma,Lymphocyte Re-infusion During Immune Suppression to Treat Metastatic Melanoma, This experiment will test the safety and effectiveness of a treatment for melanoma in which certain lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) are taken from the patient grown in the laboratory and returned after the patient's immune system has been weakened with immune-suppressing drugs. Some patients will also receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) a drug that may enhance the activity of the re-infused lymphocytes. Patients with metastatic melanoma (melanoma whose tumor has spread) who have been treated unsuccessfully with gp100 vaccination may participate in this study. They will undergo apheresis or a tumor biopsy or both to collect lymphocytes. In apheresis whole blood is drawn through a needle in the arm. A machine separates the blood components and removes the white cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm. A biopsy is a surgical procedure to remove a small piece of tumor tissue. Several weeks before the lymphocytes are collected patients will receive injections of growth colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) every day for five days. This drug stimulates white cell production permitting as many cells as possible to be obtained during collection. The lymphocytes will then be grown in larger numbers in the laboratory. Seven days before the cells are re-infused the patient is admitted to the hospital and a catheter (small tube) is placed in a large vein in the chest or neck. Two drugs cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are given through the tube. These drugs suppress the immune system so that it will not interfere with the work of the reinfused lymphocytes. The lymphocytes are then injected through the catheter over a 30-minute period. After the infusion patients who receive IL-2 will be given the drug in a high dose over a 15-minute period every eight hours for up to five days. Patients whose condition does not permit high-dose IL-2 such as those with a heart condition or lung problem may receive a low-dose regimen with the drug given as a shot under the skin of the thigh or abdomen for five days followed by a 2-day break continuing for a total of six weeks. These patients receive a higher dose the first week and then half that dose the next five weeks. Blood and tissue samples will be taken before and during the study to evaluate the size of the tumor and assess treatment. If 3-5 weeks after therapy is completed the patient's tumor has stabilized or shrunk the entire treatment except for chemotherapy may be repeated two more times.    ,NCT00001832

Melanoma,Continuation Booster Trial After a Vaccine Combining Tyrosinase/GP100/MART-1 Peptides Emulsified With Montanide ISA 51 With or Without GM-CSF for Patients With Melanoma, This is a study of a melanoma vaccine. Study participants will have melanoma that invaded deeply and spread to lymph nodes or another location. Although the participants' melanoma has been removed there is a greater than 1 out of 2 chance it will return. There will be approximately 40 subjects in this study. The patients will have already taken part in a melanoma vaccine study and in this current study they will continue to receive booster injections of a similar vaccine given for two additional years. This study will test an experimental vaccine. The vaccine contains peptides which are fragments of substances made by most melanomas. The substances are tyrosinase gpl00 and melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART-1). The vaccine also includes an assistant called Montanide ISA 51. The assistant stimulates the immune system. This study will also test the effects of a second assistant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). All participants will receive the vaccine and assistant Montanide ISA 51 but only half will receive the assistant GM-CSF. The patients have a one in two chance of receiving the assistant called GM-CSF. The main purpose of this study is to find out if the booster injections increase the body's immunity to melanoma and prevent its level of immunity from getting lower over time. The investigators also wish to know if the GM-CSF increases the body's immunity to melanoma when given with the melanoma vaccine. The vaccine and assistant Montanide ISA 51 are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The assistant GM-CSF is approved by the FDA to increase infection-fighting white blood cells after chemotherapy. It is not approved by the FDA for treatment of melanoma. However the FDA is permitting the vaccine and the assistants to be tested in this study.    ,NCT00184067
Melanoma,Phase 1 Study of GRN-1201 in HLA-A*02 Subjects With Resected Melanoma, This is a study of an investigational cancer vaccine called GRN-1201. Treatment with the GRN-1201 vaccine is a type of immunotherapy. The goal of immunotherapy is to stimulate the body's immune system (white blood cells) to attack cancer cells and kill them. GRN-1201 consists of 4 different peptides (small parts of proteins) that are expressed by melanoma cells. The intent of treatment with GRN-1201 is to increase your body's immune response to melanoma. To further increase your body's immune response against tumor cells the GRN-1201 vaccine will be mixed with Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF also known as sargramostim). GM-CSF is a man-made protein that helps stimulate the immune system and increase the response against the tumor cells. This is a phase I study which means that this will be the first time GRN-1201 is given in combination with GM-CSF to humans. It will be tested in a small number of people to evaluate its safety find a safe dose and identify side effects. The safety of GRN-1201 will be tested at three different doses; the GM-CSF dose will remain the same.    ,NCT02696356

Melanoma,Sun Exposure and Melanoma in Agricultural Workers, This K07 Career Development Award application is designed to expand Dr. Dennis career development from cancer etiology to cancer prevention and control. The career development plan rests on mentoring directed by experts in cancer prevention research and protected time to foster my professional development as an independent cancer control researcher. A unique population the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort will be used to examine sun exposure sun protection behavior and factors affecting these behaviors regarding the risk of melanoma in private pesticide applicators (farmers) and their spouses. The research plan proposed to examine skin melanoma within this prospective cohort of private applicators (mostly farmers) and their spouses in Iowa and North Carolina (the AHS) in association with environmental factors. Specific aim 1 examined the risk of melanoma in the AHS cohort using various existing measures of sun exposure adjusted for skin sensitivity and sun protection. Subsequently (for aim 2) qualitative research methods were used to design appropriate measures of sun exposure sun protection behavior and factors affecting these behaviors in private applicators and their spouses within the AHS based on the cohort analyses. Now Aim 3 will be completed by conducting a nested case-control study of melanoma within the AHS cohort to examine in more detail sun exposure histories and protective behavior. The questionnaire was designed based on findings from the cohort analyses (aim 1) and qualitative methods (aim 2). The risk of melanoma will be examined regarding: a) the complex relationship of cumulative (sun exposure during each decade of life) and intermittent sun exposure (sunburns and sunny vacations) b) factors affecting behavior including attitudes about sun exposure and prevention and c) the use of tanning salons and sunless tanning creams particularly in spouses (expected to be rare overall). The final aim is to use the results from the cohort and nested case-control studies to design a behavioral intervention along with short computer automated telephone interview (CATI) that can be used in the whole AHS cohort or other farming populations. Funding for such studies will be sought through the R01) mechanism as an independent cancer control researcher. The behavioral intervention will be based on those factors that are the strongest risk factors for melanoma highly prevalent and easily modifiable. The behavioral intervention will be designed based on knowledge and skill gained from the Career Development Plan goals.    ,NCT00901966
Melanoma,Trial of Vemurafenib/Cobimetinib With or Without Bevacizumab in Patients With Stage IV BRAFV600 Mutant Melanoma, This phase 2 clinical trial randomizes patients with BRAF mutant melanoma to either (1) standard of care (SOC) - BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in combination with MEK inhibitor cobimetinib; or (2) SOC plus bevacizumab an anti-VEGF antibody that suppresses new blood vessel formation and can stimulate the immune system. Previous clinical studies in melanoma have shown that bevacizumab may improve clinical benefit (progression free survival) if combined with ipilimumab or abraxane. Preclinical studies suggest that VEGF increase plays a role in resistance to BRAF inhibitors. This randomized study will ask whether the addition of bevacizumab to targeted therapy SOC in BRAF mutant melanoma can improve response rates and clinical benefit. Patients may have received no therapy for advanced disease or up to 2 prior therapies excluding BRAF and MEK inhibitors.    ,NCT01495988

Sorafenib may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sorafenib together with temsirolimus may kill more tumor cells.    ,NCT01851408
Melanoma,A Study to Assess APO866 for the Treatment of Advanced Melanoma, This phase II study is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of APO866 for the treatment of patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma. APO866 has shown to induce growth inhibition in cultures of human melanoma cells as well as in animal models with subcutaneously implanted melanoma tumors. APO866 was considered to be safe and well tolerated in a phase I study that treated 24 patients with advanced cancer. In that study one of the two patients with advanced melanoma had a stable disease for 5 months with size reduction of some lesions. APO866 is administered by intravenous infusion continuously for 96 hours that is repeated every 4 weeks. Patients will receive 3 cycles of treatment and the primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 16. Patients will be follow-up for 12 months.    ,NCT00432107
Melanoma,Comparative Study of Individualized Sensitivity-Directed Chemotherapy Versus DTIC, This phase III trial is aimed to investigate the efficacy of an individualized sensitivity-directed combination chemotherapy in comparison to the standard regimen DTIC.

Is an individualized sensitivity-directed combination chemotherapy superior to the standard regimen DTIC in terms of survival and response ?    ,NCT00779714
Melanoma,Adaptive Staged Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Spinal Metastases That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery, This pilot clinical trial studies adaptive staged stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating patients with spinal metastases that cannot be removed by surgery. SBRT is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Adaptive SBRT uses information gathered during treatment to inform guide and alter future radiation treatments. Staged SBRT uses multiple treatments separated by 2-3 weeks. Giving adaptive staged SBRT may work better in treating spinal metastases that cannot be removed by surgery.    ,NCT02527304
Melanoma,Utility of Novel BRAF Test for Melanoma, This primary purpose of this study is to obtain blood samples from participants with both early and later stages of melanoma (Stage II/III and Stage IV). The researchers hope to better understand an abnormal protein found in many melanoma tumors called the BRAFV600 mutation. There will be two separate cohorts (groups) of participants on this study. You will be placed in one of the Groups. Group 1-For participants with advanced melanoma: Your existing tumor tissue sample will be compared to the blood samples given in order to further analyze and to understand the BRAFV600E gene mutation. Group 2-For participants with stage II/III melanoma: Following surgery blood samples will be collected and analyzed. Understanding the BRAFV600E gene mutation in melanoma will help the researchers better understand the disease and help plan treatment options for people with melanoma of all stages in the future.    ,NCT01840527

Melanoma,Temozolomide Plus Bevacizumab in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma Involving the Central Nervous System, This research is being done because melanoma in the brain is very difficult to treat because it does not respond to radiation or to chemotherapy such as temozolomide. One of the reasons for this is that the melanoma can make chemicals that signal the brain to provide new blood vessels for the tumor. The main signal is called VEGF. Bevacizumab is an antibody that blocks VEGF. The investigators want to see if the combination of bevacizumab and temozolomide will stop the melanoma from growing.    ,NCT01048554

Melanoma,An Expanded Cohort Trial of Bortezomib and Sorafenib in Advanced Malignant Melanoma, This research study involves the use of two investigational drugs: sorafenib and bortezomib. Sorafenib is designed to stop the growth of cells caused by changes associated with cancer. Bortezomib is designed to stop cancer cells from getting rid of waste products. This causes the cells to build up toxic levels of waste that leads to cell death. In the laboratory the combination of sorafenib and bortezomib has been shown to fight cancer cells better than either drug alone. We are looking to determine if the combination of sorafenib and bortezomib is a safe treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. The effectiveness of this combination will also be assessed.    ,NCT01078961
Melanoma,Safety Study of Adenovirus Vector Engineered to Express hIL-12 in Combination With Activator Ligand to Treat Melanoma, This research study involves two investigational drugs an Activator Ligand (INXN-1001) in combination with an Adenovirus Vector Engineered to Express hIL-12 (INXN-2001). IL-12 is a protein that may improve the body's natural response to disease by enhancing the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and may interfere with blood flow to the tumor. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tumor injections of INXN-2001 given in combination with different doses of INXN-1001.    ,NCT01397708
Melanoma,Dendritic Cell Activating Scaffold in Melanoma," This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of investigational melanoma vaccines. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational vaccine in this case WDVAX to use for further studies. ""Investigational"" means that the vaccine is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved WDVAX for any use in patients including people with Melanoma. The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to make a vaccine against melanoma by using your own melanoma tumor cells and combining them with other proteins which activate the immune system. We hope that by combining the cells and the proteins in this way that the vaccine will cause your own immune system to react against your melanoma tumor cells. The purpose of this study is also to determine the safest way to give this vaccine with the least amount of side effects. Each vaccine will contain your own tumor cells which have been killed by a freezing and thawing process which destroys the cells but keeps the proteins from the melanoma cells. This is called a ""tumor lysate"" Your tumor lysate is combined with other proteins which activate the immune system. The other proteins are called GM-CSF and CpG. All of this is held together to form a ""tablet"" or ""scaffold"" which is about the size of a regular aspirin tablet. The material that holds the protein together is called PLGA. PLGA is the same material that doctors use for ""dissolvable stitches"" If you have ever had a problem with these types of stitches in the past be sure to let your study doctor know about this.

Melanoma,Combined BRAF-Targeted Therapy & Immunotherapy for Melanoma, This research study is a Phase II clinical trial of an investigational combination of drugs (vemurafenib and aldesleukin) to learn whether the combination works in treating a specific cancer. While both vemurafenib and aldesleukin are approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma the FDA has not yet approved the combination of vemurafenib and aldesleukin. Researchers have found that a large number of melanoma cells have mutations in the BRAF gene. It has been shown that vemurafenib blocks the effects of these mutations in the BRAF gene and as a result may help to prevent cancer growth. Aldesleukin also referred to as IL-2 is an immunotherapy drug administered via IV infusion that increases the growth of key cells within the immune system that are responsible for targeting cancer cells. Activating more of these key cells called T-lymphocytes and natural-killer cells leads to increased cancer cell death. The BRAF gene is located on a larger pathway called the MAPK pathway. Studies have shown that when a BRAF inhibitor like vemurafenib is used to block the MAPK pathway melanocytes or cancer cells express more proteins on their surfaces making them easier for T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells to recognize and kill them. This suggests that combining BRAF-targeted therapy with aldesleukin which activates more of these white blood cells can lead to an increase in the death of cancer cells. In this research study the investigators are looking to see whether the combination of vemurafenib (a BRAF-inhibitor) combined with aldesleukin(an immunotherapy drug) work together to produce a better health outcome in people with metastatic melanoma.    ,NCT01754376
Melanoma,A Phase I Study With a Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine in Melanoma," This research study is evaluating a new type of melanoma vaccine called ""Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine"". The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to make and administer safely a vaccine against melanoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of the participant's own melanoma. It is known that melanomas have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses which may help the participant's body fight any tumor cells that could cause the melanoma to come back in the future. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune response.

The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) biochemotherapy followed by temozolomide plus sorafenib have on melanoma.    ",NCT00673361
Melanoma,Leflunomide+Vemurafenib in V600 Mutant Met. Melanoma," This research study was intended to be a Phase I/II clinical trial but the trial was terminated before the phase 1 portion was completed. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of an investigational combination of drugs. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug combination to use for the Phase II portion of the study which will enroll more participants and continue to study the effects of the drug and the safest dose. ""Investigational"" means that the combination of vemurafenib and leflunomide is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not approved this drug combination for your type of cancer. Genes are a specific part of your cell materials which send code messages to determine what the investigators bodies look like such as eye color and instruct cells to control growth and development of the body. Researchers have found that a large number of melanoma cells have mutations in the BRAF gene. Normally the BRAF gene helps to control how cells grow. Mutations in the BRAF gene may disrupt this control and allow cells in the skin to change into cancer cells in which case the cells keep dividing and growing out of control. Specifically it has been shown that vemurafenib blocks the effects of these mutations in the BRAF gene and as a result may help to prevent cancer growth. The FDA has approved vemurafenib for use in patients with BRAF mutation positive melanoma that is unable to be removed by surgery (unresectable) or that has spread (metastatic). Leflunomide is in a class of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). It is FDA approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and it is believed to decrease inflammation in that setting. However it is not approved for treatment of melanoma. The researchers of this study believe this agent may help prevent cancer growth as well as enhance the properties of drugs that target the BRAF gene (such as vemurafenib) based on recently published laboratory research and would like to learn more about any effects this combination may have on your disease. The main purposes of this study are to determine the highest dose of vemurafenib and leflunomide that can be given in combination without causing severe side effects to see whether the combination of vemurafenib and leflunomide is safe in participants with BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma and to learn if the combination of vemurafenib and leflunomide shows any signs of effectively treating your disease.

Melanoma,Bio-marker Analysis Using Circulating Tumor Cells in Patients With Melanoma, This research trial studies the levels of a type of biomarker circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of patients with stage I-IV melanoma. A biomarker is a biological molecule found in blood other body fluids or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition. Studying samples of blood in the laboratory obtained before and after treatment from patients with melanoma may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in CTC levels and whether they may predict how well patients will respond to therapy.    ,NCT02828345

Melanoma,PET Quantitative Assessments of Solid Tumor Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy, This study aims to develop methods for quantitative imaging of solid tumors in patients who are receiving immunotherapies that have a delayed mechanism of action. PET imaging with [18F] 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) is a potent diagnostic tool and is able to detect melanomas and other tumors some of which are undetectable by CT. FDG PET is now used commonly in detecting melanoma in humans as melanomas quite consistently have high glucose metabolism. PET with FDG can image the response of tumors to therapy but has not been extensively evaluated in melanoma nor in immunotherapy for melanoma. PET has been shown to be highly predictive of outcomes of patients following radioimmunotherapy of lymphoma and has shown changes in tumor glycolysis as early as 7 days after immunotherapy initiation. In order to develop PET/CT as a tool to detect early evidence of response in patients with solid tumors receiving immune checkpoint blockade investigators propose to perform PET/CT imaging prior to therapy again between days 21 and 28 and finally at 4 months post-treatment initiation. Each scan will be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. Investigators will use the PERCIST criteria to determine peak and maximum standardized uptake values corrected for lean body mass (SUL) in tumor tumor volumes and tumor total glycolytic volumes and will use CT from PET/CT to measure tumor size by immune RECIST criteria. (See section on Outcome Evaluation below.) Investigators will assess whether early changes in tumor metabolism seen on FDG PET are predictive of progression free and overall survival outcomes. Through these systematic pilot studies investigators hope to better link FDG PET measurements to individual patient responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapy and better understand and refine this emerging and often effective therapeutic approach.    ,NCT01666353

Melanoma,Immune Responses to Autologous Langerhans-type Dendritic Cells Electroporated With mRNA Encoding a Tumor-associated Antigen in Patients With Malignancy: A Single-arm Phase I Trial in Melanoma, This study is being done to see if the investigators can help the immune system to work against melanoma. A dendritic cell is another type of white blood cell. It has most if not all of the proteins needed to make T cells work to destroy cancer cells. However dendritic cells do not normally have the cancer proteins on their surface. The challenge then is to combine the antigens with dendritic cells to make a vaccine. The investigators think that the body's T cells might then react against the tumor and help destroy it. This study will see if altered dendritic cells will make T cells work against tumor cells. The dendritic cells will be made in a lab and will carry the antigens. These cells then will be injected under the skin. In this study the investigators are trying to help the body make a stronger immune response against the cancer. The patient will get the same kind of dendritic cell vaccine used in the earlier study but with one major difference. The dendritic cells will contain messenger-RNA (mRNA). Cells use mRNA to make proteins. The mRNA will be put into dendritic cells by a laboratory method called electroporation. The mRNA is never given to the patient directly. This mRNA will help the dendritic cell make a tumor antigen like what the cancer expresses. The dendritic cell can then put this tumor antigen on its surface so that the body could make a stronger immune response against the tumor.    ,NCT01456104

Melanoma,The Effects of Vemurafenib + Cobimetinib on Immunity in Patients With Melanoma, This study is for patients with malignant melanoma which has spread beyond the local area and cannot be surgically removed and who have melanoma tumors that are accessible for repeat biopsies. This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about treatment options for metastatic melanoma. This research study is evaluating the effects of the drugs vemurafenib and cobimetinib on the immune system. Vemurafenib has been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with advanced melanoma that harbors a B-RAF mutation. Vemurafenib works by blocking a protein called B-RAF. Researchers have found that a large number of melanomas have mutations (changes) in the BRAF gene. Genes are specific parts of your DNA that contain information on hereditary characteristics such as hair color and eye color. The BRAF gene codes for a protein called B-RAF which is involved in sending signals in cells that can lead to cell growth. Research has determined that mutations in the BRAF gene at the V600 position cause a change in the B-RAF protein that can drive the growth and spread of melanoma cells. Cobimetinib (GDC-0973 XL518) is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 central components of the RAS/RAF pathway. The purpose of this research study is to determine how vemurafenib and cobitmetinib may alter the immune system's reaction to melanoma in order to learn how best to combine immune therapies with vemurafenib in the future.    ,NCT01813214

Melanoma,Peptide Vaccination for Patients at High Risk for Recurrent Melanoma, This study will examine the effectiveness and side effects of an experimental vaccine to prevent recurrence of melanoma. The likelihood of melanoma returning is higher in patients who have melanoma lesions deep in the skin in patients who have had positive lymph nodes and in patients who have had surgery for metastatic disease (cancer that has spread beyond the primary site). Melanoma tumors produce proteins called glycoprotein 100 (gp100) and melanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1). Vaccination with specific pieces of these proteins (peptides) may boost the immune system's fight against the cancer. The vaccine injections are mixed with an oil-based substance called Montanide ISA-51 which is intended to increase the immune response to the peptide. Patients 16 years of age and older whose melanoma has been surgically removed and who are currently free of disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests. An electrocardiogram (EKG) x-rays and other imaging studies will be done if recent results are not available. Some candidates may require heart tests such as a cardiac stress test or echocardiogram or lung function tests. In addition all candidates will be tested for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue type; patients must be type human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A)*0201 the type on which this vaccine is based. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of four different vaccines to determine which peptides offer the best immunity. Each treatment course consists of two injections of the vaccines every 3 weeks for four times. The injections are given under the skin of the thigh. After every other treatment course (every 6 months) patients will undergo a series of x-rays and scans to look for tumor. The immunizations may continue for up to 12 months as long as the melanoma does not return. The injections are given at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. Patients are monitored for 1 hour after each injection and have blood tests and a physical examination to look for treatment side effects. Patients will be followed with blood tests every 12 weeks to monitor body functions. They will also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure to collect white blood cells-before starting treatment and about 3 to 4 weeks after the fourth vaccine to evaluate how the vaccines affect the action of the immune system cells. For this procedure blood is drawn through a needle in the arm similar to donating blood. The blood goes through a machine that separates out the lymphocytes (white blood cells) and the rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. Some patients may undergo a biopsy-surgical removal of a small piece of tissue under local anesthetic-of normal skin and tumor or lymph node tissue to examine the effects of the vaccines on the tumor immune cells. Patients whose disease returns during the first course of vaccine therapy will have surgery to remove the tumor and will continue to receive the vaccine treatment. Patients whose tumor returns after completing one course of therapy may receive a substance called interleukin-2 (IL-2) which can boost immune function against the tumor. interleukin-2 (IL-2) is given intravenously (through a small tube placed in a vein) every 8 hours for 4 days. This regimen is repeated after 10 to 14 days. Those who respond to interleukin-2 (IL-2) will have a third course of treatment after 2 months. Patients whose disease recurs after treatment will be taken off the study and will be referred back to their referring physician or to another study if an appropriate one is available.    ,NCT00059475
Melanoma,Melanoma Perception and Health Literacy in People of Color, This study will examine the effectiveness of a targeted health literate educational intervention for people of color compared to a standard melanoma education pamphlet for increasing knowledge and promoting early melanoma detection. It is hypothesized that people of color are less aware of their risk for developing melanoma and that a targeted educational intervention will help increase knowledge and promote early melanoma detection especially in individuals with low health literacy.    ,NCT02437305
Melanoma,Vaccine Treatment in Combination With IL-2 and Treated Lymphocytes for Advanced Melanoma, This study will examine the effectiveness of treating advanced melanoma with special tumor-fighting cells taken from the patient's blood or tumor and grown in the laboratory. The cells are given along with infusions of a growth factor-like substance called interleukin-2 (IL-2) and an experimental vaccine called fowlpox gp100. This vaccine consists of a peptide (part of a protein) called gp100 that is often found in melanoma tumors and chicken virus (fowlpox) that has been altered so that it cannot produce illness in humans. Patients 16 years of age and older with melanoma that has spread beyond the original site and that does not respond to standard treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination chest x-ray electrocardiogram blood and urine tests and x-rays and scans to the evaluate the extent and size of the tumor. Because the experimental preparation is based on tissue type only patients with tissue type HLA-A*0201 may participate. Tissue type is determined by a blood test. Participants undergo the following procedures:   -  Leukapheresis a procedure for collecting lymphocytes (white blood cells): Using this procedure special cells with good tumor-fighting ability are selected and removed for later re-infusion into the patient. To collect the cells blood is withdrawn through a needle in an arm vein and directed through a catheter into a cell-separating machine. The lymphocytes are removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through the same needle. Alternatively lymphocytes may also be collected from biopsied tumor tissue obtained either with a needle or by a small cut in the tumor.   -  G-CSF injections: This growth factor is injected under the skin every day for 5 days to stimulate white blood cell production.   -  Catheter placement: Upon admission to the Clinical Center for treatment the patient has a catheter (plastic tube) placed in a vein in the neck or arm for giving chemotherapy and other medicines for infusing the lymphocytes and for collecting blood samples.   -  Leukapheresis: Repeated in the hospital to collect and store blood that may be needed in the rare event that the patient's blood components do not recover after chemotherapy.   -  Chemotherapy: A week before the lymphocyte infusion patients receive a 1-hour infusion of cyclophosphamide for 2 days and then a 15- to 30-minute infusion of fludarabine for 5 days to suppress the immune system and thereby prevent rejection of the infused lymphocytes.   -  Vaccine and lymphocyte delivery: The vaccine is injected through the catheter followed by a 30-minute infusion of the lymphocytes.   -  IL-2 and G-CSF: Patients receive IL-2 infusions every 8 hours for up to 5 days after the cell infusion to help keep the cells alive and G-CSF injections under the skin every day after the cell infusion until white cells increase to a sufficient number. The entire hospital stay is usually 12 to 16 days. About 4 weeks after the lymphocyte infusion patients are re-admitted to the hospital for about 10 days for a second vaccine injection and course of IL-2 infusions. Between 2 and 4 weeks after completing the full treatment regimen patients return to NIH for evaluation. Those whose tumors have shrunk or remained stable may repeat the entire treatment regimen two times. Those whose tumors continued to grow may be re-treated with infusion of lymphocytes through an artery instead of a vein if their tumors receive blood from a major artery. If this is not feasible or if it is tried without success the patients will be taken off the study.    ,NCT00080353
Melanoma,EPO906 Therapy in Patients With Advanced Melanoma, This study will examine whether the new investigational drug EPO906 given by intravenous infusion (IV directly into the vein) is effective in shrinking tumors and preventing the growth of cells that cause melanoma.    ,NCT00035165
Melanoma,Clinical Laboratory and Epidemiologic Characterization of Individuals and Families at High Risk of Melanoma, This study will investigate how genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of melanoma a type of skin cancer and related conditions. Individuals of any age with a personal or family history of melanoma may be eligible for this study. Participants will:   -  Fill out one or two questionnaires about their personal and family medical history.   -  Provide written consent for researchers to review their medical records and pathology materials related to their care and those of deceased relatives with melanomas tumors cancer or other related illnesses for whom they are the next-of-kin or legally authorized representative.   -  Donate a blood or cheek cell sample to be used for genetic studies. (The blood sample is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The cheek cell sample is obtained either by gently brushing the inside of the mouth with a soft brush or by swishing a tablespoon of mouthwash and then spitting it into a container.)   -  Undergo a skin biopsy (removal of a small piece of skin tissue) for genetic study. For this procedure the area of skin to be removed is numbed with a local anesthetic and a 1/4-inch piece of skin is excised with a cookie cutter-like instrument. The wound is then covered with a band-aid. Participants may be asked to travel to the NIH Clinical Center for evaluation including a medical history physical examination and some of the following procedures:   -  Full body skin examination to evaluate the type and number of moles and document any evidence of sun damage to the skin. The examination involves all the skin from the scalp to the bottoms of the feet. After the examination a medical photographer will photograph the skin with close-ups of skin lesions marked by the examiner. If there are parts of the skin the participant does not want examined or photographed he or she can tell the examiner.   -  Blood draw of about 120 milliliters (4 ounces) or less   -  Skin biopsy   -  Cheek cell sample   -  X-rays ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies to detect tumors or changes in tumors or other types of changes in specific tissues. MRI is a diagnostic test that uses strong magnetic fields and radiowaves to examine body tissues. The subject lies on a table that is moved into a large tunnel-like machine (the scanner) for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. When the tests are finished a doctor will discuss the results with the participant and the need if any for clinical follow-up.    ,NCT00040352
Melanoma,Study of Trametinib and Nab-paclitaxel in Patients With Melanoma, This study will investigate the combination of two drugs trametinib and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

In this trial the investigators will determine the maximum dose of the drug combination to be administered to patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma and examine the safety profile of the drug combination.    ,NCT02300935
Melanoma,Lenalidomide (Revlimid) to Treat Advanced Ocular Melanoma, This study will test whether an experimental drug called Revlimid (lenalidomide) can reduce tumor size and prolong survival in patients with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread beyond the original tumor site). It will also examine the toxicity and blood effects of Revlimid. Patients 18 years of age and older with stage IV ocular melanoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical and examination blood and urine tests electrocardiogram chest x-ray computed tomography (CT) scan and other imaging scans if needed such as a bone scan magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ultrasound or positron emission tomography (PET). Participants are admitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center for 24 hours for their first oral dose of Revlimid. During the hospital stay blood is drawn before the dose is given and again at 0.25 0.5 1 2 4 6 9 12 and 24 hours after dosing to see how the body handles the drug. If the drug is well tolerated patients are sent home with a 21-day supply of drug to take once a day for 21 days then go off drug 7 days. This regimen constitutes one 28-day treatment cycle. Treatment cycles may continue for up to 2 years. Patients keep a daily diary of side effects and have blood drawn once a week. The drug dose may be adjusted according to the laboratory test results. If unacceptable toxicity occurs treatment may be stopped. Patients who agree to be biopsied undergo this procedure before treatment begins and at the end of treatment cycles 3 and 6. A small area of skin is numbed with medicine and a small piece of tumor is removed with a needle or by a small cut in the tumor. The tissue is examined under a microscope. Patients return to NIH after the first month of treatment and then every 3 months to evaluate their tumors and treatment of side effects. The visits include a physical examination x-rays and scans to evaluate tumors. Visits are scheduled every 3 months while on treatment; then every 3 months for 2 years afterwards; then every 4 months for 1 year; and as needed after that. Patients will have a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan once a year to watch for new tumor areas.    ,NCT00109005
Melanoma,NIR-Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Melanoma, This study will try to define an appropriate dose of the investigational drug indocyanine green (ICG) in combination with near infrared (NIR) imaging to use for future studies. ICG is a dye which has been in use since the 50s and is approved for testing liver function and measuring blood flow from the heart. It has been used in studies to map lymphatic pathways in lung and breast cancer and information from those studies suggest it may help identify lymph nodes associated with melanoma. ICG can be detected within the body using near-infrared light cameras. In this study the investigators are looking at how easily ICG can get to the first lymph node (sentinel lymph node [SLN]) associated with melanoma whether the investigators can see the path of the ICG and the SLN using a near infrared camera and what dose of ICG works the best. While the current method for SNL mapping known as lymphoscintigraphy is effective it does provide a small amount of radiation. This study will compare the investigators results to the standard procedure.    ,NCT01121718

Melanoma,The Impact of Total Body Skin Examination on Skin Cancer Detection, This will be a study where all patients will undergo a two-step procedure: Step 1 - Physicians examine the problem area of skin ONLY and record result. Step 2 - Physicians perform TBSE and record result. Eventual lesions suggestive of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers will be recorded after step 1 or step 2 examination and will be finally biopsied and histopathologically diagnosed. Exceptions to biopsy may include patients with multiple non-melanoma skin cancers (e.g. actinic keratoses or basal cell carcinomas). Each center will be provided with an electronic data sheet for patients record or alternatively with a paper record form. Endpoints of the study are new parameters concerning the standard of care for skin cancer screening. We expect to conclude that TBSE enables clinicians discovering an increased number of skin cancers thus resulting in earlier detection.    ,NCT00765193

Melanoma,Genetic Risk Factors and Acquired Oncogenic Mutations of Melanoma, Though it is generally accepted that exposure to sunlight is a major causative factor for skin cancer the risk for developing melanoma is not directly linked to sun exposure such as in non-melanoma skin cancer. Therefore a dual pathway has been proposed distinguishing melanoma that develops on skin that is chronically exposed to sunlight from those that occur on skin that is normally protected. The risk for each type of melanoma is believed to be determined in part by genetic factors. To define these markers reproducibly the investigators plan to establish a large cohort with comprehensive information regarding sun sensitivity (skin type) history of experienced sun exposure skin pigmentation phenotypes total number of nevi and other types of skin tumors in a central European population. The investigators will obtain blood from all participants for DNA as well as serum analyses. Based on the finding that genetic variants of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene associated with red hair and fair skin have been shown to be associated with increased risk for melanoma particularly those harboring BRAF mutations the investigators will now focus on the study of recently discovered genetic variants associated with pigmentation. Furthermore the investigators will study the relation of these variants with oncogenic mutations of melanoma in BRAF RAS and c-Kit. The study of other genetic variants will follow once a sufficiently large cohort has been established to reveal an independent genetic risk factor in a multivariate analysis including potential covariates as mentioned above. The identification of genetic risk factors for melanoma will not only help identify individuals with increased risk but also improve our understanding of the molecular background of the development of melanoma.    ,NCT00849407

Melanoma,Determine Toxicity and Antibody Responses With a KLH Conjugated Bivalent Vaccine Containing GD2 Lactone GD3 Lactone With Immunological Adjuvant QS-DG or OPT-821 in Patients With Disease Free AJCC Stage III or IV Cutaneous Melanoma, Vaccines contain substances that help us make antibodies. Different antibodies help protect us against a variety of harmful things. GD2 and GD3 gangliosides are substances found on the surface of most melanoma cells. They are also occasionally found on some normal cells. Large quantities of antibodies called monoclonal antibodies have been prepared in the laboratory against GD2 and GD3 and given to patients with metastatic melanoma. In about 10% of cases this has resulted in clinically relevant regression of melanomas. These monoclonal antibodies are not currently available or used in the clinic but studies in the laboratory indicate that vaccines against GD2 and GD3 can be as effective as monoclonal antibodies. In this trial we wish to raise the level of antibodies in your blood against GD2 and GD3. We will vaccinate you with the modified forms of GD2 called GD2 lactone and GD3 called GD3 lactone (GD3L) all attached to the antibody booster KLH and mixed with the immune booster (immunologic adjuvant) QS-DG. While over a thousand patients have received vaccines with QS-21 the QS-DG used here is synthesized for the first time at MSKCC and is referred to as QS-DG rather than QS-21 which is purified from tree bark. QS-21 and QS-DG are to the best of our knowledge chemically identical. It is unknown if using this bivalent vaccine will raise the level of antibodies in your blood to either ganglioside. It is unknown if raising the level of antibodies in your blood will lower your risk of relapse. This study will check your blood for production of antibodies and check you for side effects.    ,NCT00597272

Melanoma,Study of Risk Factors and Clinical Characterization of Rapidly Growing Melanoma," State of the question Over the past decade the incidence of melanoma (MM) has steadily increased in France and in most developed countries. This increased incidence was concerned mainly MM thin while the incidence of MM thick that represent the true ""killers"" and mortality from MM remained stable or increased slightly over the same period. These epidemiological data and observations from everyday medical practice dermatologists suggest the existence of different growth patterns within MM. Indeed some MM progressing slowly sometimes for decades before diagnosis but are thin at the time of resection. Conversely others MM grow very quickly resulting in thick tumors despite a diagnosis and resection sometimes very early. These fast growing MM (FGMM) probably contribute significantly to the relative mortality in MM as improved screening failed to influence to this day. Our team has already demonstrated that the growth kinetics of the MM was a prognostic factor of tumor aggressiveness regardless of the thickness of the tumor. Using the same method to calculate the growth rate an Australian team recently studied the growth rate in a population of patients suffering from MM. In this population 1/3 of MM had a growth of more than 0.5 mm per month. Clinical aspects and FGMM of these risk factors were individuals (injuries symmetrical achromic and regular occurrence among about older and low-nevi). The European and Australian people are very different in particular regarding the prevention policy these results can not be extrapolated to the French population.The main objective is to identify risk factors for FGMM in French propulation    ",NCT02879474

Melanoma,Induction Therapy With Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib to Optimize Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Therapy, Rationale: The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab induces relatively high response rates and promising response depth in late stage melanoma. Nevertheless it takes time till responses occur and still a significant number of patients do not benefit from treatment due to rapid progressive disease or resistance to therapy. In contrast to immunotherapies targeted therapies (BRAF or MEK inhibitors) can induce faster and higher response rates but often of shorter duration even when combined. Initial attempts of combining vemurafenib or dabrafenib + trametinib with ipilimumab failed due to toxicity. Patients with elevated levels of serum LDH are less likely to respond to immunotherapy compared to patients with normal LDH levels. This does not mean that such patients do not benefit at all from immunotherapy. This raises the question whether response rates upon immunotherapy can be improved by upfront reduction of tumor burden and normalization of LDH. The investigators postulate that induction therapy with combined BRAF+MEK inhibition and subsequent LDH normalization can improve response rates to the rates seen in LDH normal patients. To address this question the investigators have setup a randomized phase 2 trial in metastatic melanoma patients with elevated serum LDH comparing the response rates upon ipilimumab + nivolumab versus ipilimumab + nivolumab preceded by 6 weeks of vemurafenib + cobimetinib induction. Furthermore less than half of the patients treated with the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab received maintenance nivolumab and approximately 40% of all patients discontinued treatment for toxicity. In 70% of patients responses were ongoing despite discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity. This raises the question to what extent does maintenance therapy add clinical benefit to an ongoing immune response. Preclinical data indicate even that continuous restimulation of T cells can result in activation induced non-responsiveness (anergy). Therefore a secondary objective of this trial will be to test a response-driven nivolumab scheme Objectives: Primary Objective ??To compare efficacy of induction vemurafenib + cobimetinib followed by ipilimumab + nivolumab (Arm A) versus upfront ipilimumab + nivolumab treatment (Arm B). Secondary Objectives   -  To describe duration of response and overall survival induced by vemurafenib + cobimetinib followed by the combination of ipilimumab + nivolumab (Arm A) as compared to ipilimumab + nivolumab (Arm B)   -  To describe the rate and quality of toxicity observed in the two study arms   -  To describe the rate of ongoing responses upon response-driven flat dose (240mg q2w) nivolumab maintenance   -  To determine the immune-activating capacity of induction therapy with vemurafenib + cobimetinib followed by the combination of ipilimumab + nivolumab.   -  To evaluate the changes in systemic immune competence Study design: This is a two-arm phase 2 study consisting of 200 BRAFV600E/K mutation-positive late-stage melanoma patients with an elevated baseline LDH level (> ULN < 3xULN) randomized 1:1 (stratified according to LDH) to receive either vemurafenib + cobimetinib directly followed by ipilimumab + nivolumab (Arm A) or standard first line ipilimumab + nivolumab (Arm B). Subsequently patients in both arms will receive flat dose (240mg q2w) nivolumab maintenance in a response-driven manner. Study population: Stage IV or unresectable stage III BRAFV600E/K mutation positive melanoma patients naïve for BRAF/MEK PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 targeting therapy 18 years and older. Intervention: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 6 weeks vemurafenib 960 mg bid + cobimetinib 60 mg QD 21-day on 7-day off (21/7) schedule directly followed by 4 courses of ipilimumab 3mg/kg q3wk + nivolumab 1mg/kg q3wk (Arm A) or first line standard 4 courses of ipilimumab 3mg/kg q3wk + nivolumab 1mg/kg q3wk (Arm B). Subsequently patients in both arms will receive nivolumab maintenance flat dose (240mg q2w) in a response-driven manner according to their response at week 18.

Melanoma,Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Melanoma Patients Scheduled for Regional Lymph Node Dissection, Dendritic cells (DCs) are the professional antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. As such they are currently used in clinical vaccination protocols in cancer patients and both immunological and clinical responses have been observed. For these therapies accurate delivery to target organs is essential. Correct delivery and subsequent migration of vaccinated DCs to regional lymph nodes is of paramount importance for effective stimulation of the immune system. Currently it is not known what the best route of administration is for DC vaccines. Using magnetically labeled DCs we investigate the potential of MRI cell tracking to monitor DC therapy. This is investigated in stage III/IV melanoma patients in whom a regional lymph node dissection is scheduled. Autologous monocyte-derived DCs are labeled with the clinically approved superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) formulation Endorem and 111In-oxine and injected either in the skin or directly in lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance. Two days after vaccination patients are monitored with scintigraphy and MR imaging. Lymph nodes are then resected. Subsequently patients receive 3 more vaccination with DCs. During and after therapy immune responses against the used melanoma peptides are monitored.    ,NCT00243594
Melanoma,Peptide-pulsed vs. RNA-transfected Dendritic Cell Vaccines in Melanoma Patients, Dendritic cells (DCs)are the most potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system as such they are able to direct the immune system specifically against cancer cells. Currently DCs are used in clinical vaccination studies and immunological and clinical responses have been observed. For inducing anti-tumor immunity the DCs have to be loaded with tumor antigen (i.e. molecular structures that are presented by the tumor that are recognized by the immune system). Currently most studies use tumor peptides (small protein fragments) for this purpose. This approach has several disadvantages: only patients with a certain HLA-type can be treated and the immune response that is induced by the vaccine is limited to the used peptides. These disadvantages do not exist when the DCs present antigen which is endogenously processed for example after RNA transfection. For this reason we investigate the immunogenicity of DCs that are pulsed with peptides or transfected with mRNA encoding melanoma associated antigens in stage III and IV melanoma patients.    ,NCT00243529
Melanoma,Monocentric Pilot Study Investigating the Metabolic Activity of Melanoma in Vivo During Sorafenib and Dacarbazine, Investigation of the metabolic activity of sorafenib and sorafenib plus dacarbazine on melanoma metastasis in patients with melanoma stage III or IV on the basis of PET/CT LDH and S-100 evaluation. As we hypothezise a direct influence on the transcriptome by these drugs via antiproliferative or apoptotic signals biopsies of melanoma skin metastases will be assessed with microarrays and direct changes will be revealed. If positive effects on the transcriptional profiles of metastases are revealed patients with metastatic melanomas would benefit from these drugs resulting in tumor regressions. Therefore a total of 12 patients with skin- or superficial lymph node metastases with a diameter of at least 1 cm will be chosen for sorafenib therapy over 56 days per os twice daily with each 400 mg and additionally on day 14 and 42 intravenous dacarbazine infusion (volume depending on the body surface area (1000 mg/m2)). Before treatment with sorafenib before treatment with dacarbazine and after treatment S100 and LDH will be measured in serum PET/CT will be conducted and biopsy will be taken out of one skin metastasis on the same day.    ,NCT00794235

Melanoma,Role of SLURP-1 in Melanoma and Melanoma Stem Cells, Melanoma is the most aggressive skin cancer with a propensity to metastasize and is resistant to most of the current therapeutic regimens. Incidence rate of melanoma in patients with MDM (Mal De Maleda with SLURP-1 mutation) is much higher than normal counterpart. SLURP-1 (lymphocyte antigen 6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1) is an allosteric agonist to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and it regulates epidermal homeostasis and T-cell function. The preliminary results of comparing human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4 affected and 15 unaffected members from the family with MDM revealed that T-cell activation was impaired in PBMCs with the heterozygous and homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation. (2 of affected members developed melanoma.) Since there is currently no effective treatment for metastatic melanoma identifying novel molecular mechanisms may lead to development of new treatments for metastatic melanomas. Previous study showed that melanoma stem cells (MSCs) are crucial in melanoma pathogenesis: 1.Melanoma contains ABCB5 CD133 and ABCG2 positive cells had enhanced tumorigenic potential. 2.Higher frequencies of cells capable of initiating melanoma xenografts when using IL2Rγ-/- NOD SCID mice. These data confirmed the interaction between T cells and MSCs. In this project we will investigate the roles of SLURP-1 in melanoma and MSCs. Investigating and verifying the interaction between T-cells from patients with MDM and melanoma cells to confirm the SLURP-1 function of tumorigenesis in xenotransplant mice (IL2Rγ-/- NOD SCID) model. To reveal the role of SLURP-1 silencing in melanoma cell lines by using not only A2058  A375 and MeWo mwlanima cell lines but also ABCB5+ melanoma cells and ABCB5- melanoma cells through the tumorigenesis apoptosisangiogenesis proliferation melanosphere formation assays. The aim of this project is to investigate the roles and molecular mechanisms of SLURP-1 in melanoma carcinogenesis which may improve the development of novel treatments for melanoma.    ,NCT01281722
Melanoma,Treatment of Melasma With Stabilized Kligman Preparation Associated or Not With Pulsed Dye Laser, Melasma is an acquired disorder of pigmentation that leads to irregular pigmented patches on the face. Treatment is difficult and to date the best treatment option is the combination of hydroquinone retinoic acid and steroids combined in topical daily application (called Kligman's trio). Q-switched pigmentary lasers are usually ineffective and can induce post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Intense pulsed light can sometimes improve melasma but also induce PIH which limit their use. Recently pulsed dye laser were demonstrated to be effective in treating some pigmentary defects. Associating blanching cream with hydroquinone to prevent PIH after laser or intense pulsed light has been already reported with success. The objective of the study is to compare in a prospective intra individual comparative trial the association of pulsed dye laser plus stabilized Kligman's trio to Kligman's trio alone. The secondary objective was to study the frequency and the intensity of the potential side effects including PIH.    ,NCT00863278

Melanoma,Circulating Cell-free DNA in Metastatic Melanoma Patient: Mutational Analyses in Consecutive Measurement Before and After Chemotherapy, Therapies that target specific molecules markedly inhibit cancer growth in several malignancies and provide valuable strategies for the treatment of advanced melanoma. In recent years BRAF and KIT have become established therapeutic targets in melanoma patients showing activating mutations in these oncogenes. However it is crucial that genetic mutations present in the melanoma lesions are identified if the investigators are to design tailormade therapies for individual patients. The tumour genotypes that determine the selection of molecular-targeted therapies are usually identified in primary tumours; however primary tumours are not always representative of metastases. Circulating free DNA may be a source of valuable information because it can be obtained via routine blood sampling it provides real-time information about a patient's current disease state and it allows monitoring and molecular characterization before and after chemotherapy. The aim of the study is to determine the mutational status in circulating DNA in melanoma metastatic patients with the Sequenom Mass Array a next generation sequencing technology. Results obtained before and after treatment will be compared with the primary tumor genotype.    ,NCT02133222
Melanoma,Drosophila-generated CTL, Background:   -  Recent cancer treatment studies have shown that altering a cancer patient's own white blood cells may help the immune system fight the cancer. In all of these studies participants donate their own white blood cells through a procedure called leukapheresis and the cells are altered in the laboratory and given back to the participants. After the cells are given the patients receive aldesleukin (IL-2) to help the tumor fighting cells stay alive longer. For individuals with metastatic melanoma pieces of melanoma proteins may be added to the collected white blood cells to help the immune system recognize and attack the cancer cells.   -  Researchers are interested in testing a new process in which cells from fruit flies (Drosophila) are used to help the melanoma proteins attach to the white blood cells. The fruit fly cells die off shortly after the proteins are introduced to the white blood cells. Researchers are also interested in determining whether IL-2 treatment is necessary after this new cancer treatment process. Objectives:   -  To test the safety and effectiveness of modified white blood cells (Drosophila-generated CTL) as a treatment for metastatic melanoma that has not responded to standard treatments.   -  To determine whether IL-2 treatment improves the effectiveness of Drosophila-generated cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma that has not responded to previous IL-2 treatment. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history tumor imaging studies and heart and lung function tests.   -  Prior to treatment participants will have an intravenous catheter inserted into the chest to administer the study drugs.   -  Participants will have leukapheresis to provide white blood cells for laboratory modification.   -  Seven days before the start of the treatment participants will be admitted to the hospital to have chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. These drugs will suppress the immune system to improve the effects of the treatment.   -  One to four days after the last dose of chemotherapy participants will receive the modified cells. Participants in the group that will receive IL-2 will begin to receive the treatment 24 hours after the cell infusion every day for 5 days. All participants will receive filgrastim injections to help the body produce more white blood cells.   -  Participants will recover in the hospital for about 7 to 12 days after the cell infusion or the last dose of IL-2. Participants will continue to receive medications and provide blood and tumor samples for testing.   -  Participants will have regular followup visits to assess the effects of the treatment.    ,NCT01271907
Melanoma,Inducing Systemic Immunity and Regressions in Metastatic Melanoma, In patients with multiple metastatic nodules of melanoma the investigators evaluated whether autologous cytokines injected into cutaneous metastases would induce a systemic immune response as evidenced by the accumulation of dense lymphocytic infiltrates in metastases that had never been injected. Such immune responses were observed and often the never-injected metastasis regressed completely. 20% of patients remained free of disease for greater than 5 years.    ,NCT02350972

Melanoma,Irradiated Donor Lymphocyte Infusion Plus High-dose IL-2, Partially HLA-matched irradiated donor lymphcyte infusion alone resulted in 27% overall response rate (ORR) in advanced renal cell carcinoma without significant toxicities. In addition high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2)showed an ORR of 6-21% in metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma with a durable response in patients who achieved complete remission. Therefore irradiated donor lymphocyte infusion plus high-dose IL-2 might show a synergistic anti-tumor activity agaist relapsed or metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma.    ,NCT01925118
Melanoma,Safety and Efficacy of Marqibo in Metastatic Malignant Uveal Melanoma, Marqibo (liposomal vincristine) is a form of vincristine preparation. Vincristine is designed to interfere with the multiplication of cancer cells which may slow or stop their growing and spreading throughout the body. This may cause the cancer cells to die. Liposomal vincristine is formed when vincristine is placed inside of oil droplets called liposomes which may help to improve the delivery of drug to the tumor site. The liposomal formulation results in a slow steady release of vincristine in the tumor metastasis exposing the cancer cells to vincristine continuously. The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Marqibo (liposomal vincristine) can help to control metastatic uveal melanoma. The safety of liposomal vincristine will also be studied. Approximately 50 patients will take part in this study.    ,NCT00506142

Melanoma,Peginterferon and TIL Therapy for Metastatic Melanoma, Adoptive T cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has achieved impressive clinical results with durable complete responses in patients with metastatic melanoma. The TILs are isolated from the patients own tumor tissue followed by in vitro expansion and activation for around 4-6 weeks. Before TIL infusion the patients receive 1 week of preconditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. After TIL infusion Interleukin-2 are administered to support T cell activation and proliferation in vivo. In this trial the therapy is combined with peginterferon (the pegylated form of interferon alpha 2b). Interferon alpha has immunomodulatory effects and is known to upregulate HLA expression on melanoma cells and are hypothesized to synergize with TIL therapy.    ,NCT02379195
Melanoma,Phase II Randomized Trial of Ipilimumab Versus Ipilimumab and Radiotherapy in Metastatic Melanoma," An attractive area of research regards immune manipulations to recover some of the patient's immune response to his/her tumor a strategy that has the advantages of being both natural and potentially long-lasting.[1] We propose to combine immunotherapy with radiotherapy directed to a metastatic site to create a ""hub"" for in vivo immunization to the tumor to enable ""tumor rejection"" at the other metastatic sites. This ""in vivo immunization"" is explored as a viable alternative to an individualized vaccine approach. Preclinical data generated by us and others support a ""proof of principle"" clinical trial that may open the field to an alternative use of radiotherapy in a novel partnership with cancer immunotherapy.[2]    ",NCT01689974
Melanoma,Molecular Characterization of Advanced Stage Melanoma by Blood Sampling, Analysis of somatic mutations in tumors is currently indicated for daily practice in all metastatic melanoma. Actually this research is limited to the mutation of three biomarkers validated by the l'Institut National du CAncer (INCA): BRAF NRAS and CKIT. Moreover in some cases it requires invasive biopsies. In this context molecular characterization of a tumor material flowing (circulating tumor DNA and / or circulating tumor cells) could afford to benefit patients in the best conditions of current targeted therapies and future.    ,NCT02862743
Melanoma,Docetaxel and Vinorelbine Plus Sargramostim in Metastatic Malignant Melanoma, Annually in the U.S. there is an estimated 40000 new cases of malignant melanoma and 7000 deaths. This disease is becoming more common with its incidence increasing at a more rapid rate in the past decade than that of any other cancer except lung cancer in women. Metastatic disease responds poorly to the usual treatments with only 2 out of 30 drugs tested DTIC and nitrosoureas showing response rates greater than 10%. Complete responses are rare. Metastatic melanoma is a disease with few therapeutic options. Multi-agent chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) Dacarbazine (DTIC) Carmustine (BCNU) with or without Tamoxifen offers a 20% response rate but has failed to consistently demonstrate a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) when compared to a single agent DTIC. Recently investigators in an effort to combine the activity of biologic response modifiers with chemotherapy have developed combination biochemotherapy for metastatic melanoma. Legha et al reported an overall objective response rate of 64% with a 5-day biochemotherapy regimen. O'Day et al reported similar results (overall response rate of 57%) using a modified 5-day biochemotherapy regimen. The above regimens all have significant toxicities and modest response rates. Clearly more effective less toxic regimens are needed. Vinorelbine tartrate (Navelbine) and Docetaxel (Taxotere) have both shown activity against melanoma. Additionally the combination of both drugs has shown enhanced activity against melanoma.    ,NCT00256282

Melanoma,Phase II Study of Aldesleukin (IL-2) Following the Administration of Zanolimumab (Anti-CD4mAb) in Metastatic Melanoma and Metastatic Renal Cancer, Background:   -  Aldesleukin (IL-2) is a drug that can help to shrink tumors in some patients with metastatic renal cancer and metastatic melanoma. It is possible that removing certain white blood cells (known as CD4 cells) before IL-2 treatment may improve the treatment effects.   -  Zanolimumab is an antibody that works by destroying CD4 cells in the blood. Researchers are interested in determining whether zanolimumab can improve the results of IL-2 treatment if it is given before during and after IL-2 treatment. In addition further research with zanolimumab may provide more information on how IL-2 treatment causes tumors to stop growing or shrink. Objectives: - To evaluate the effectiveness of IL-2 treatment in conjunction with zanolimumab in individuals with metastatic cancer. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma or metastatic kidney cancer. Design:   -  Eligible participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history imaging studies and blood samples including leukapheresis to remove a sample of white blood cells for testing purposes. Participants may also have a colonoscopy and biopsies if they have received previous treatments that have been known to cause colon damage.   -  Participants will be treated with zanolimumab and IL-2 treatment for 9 weeks.   -  Zanolimumab will be given on an outpatient basis during weeks 1 through 4 6 8 and 9. In weeks 5 and 7 participants will receive zanolimumab as an inpatient in addition to IL-2 therapy.   -  Inpatient IL-2 treatment will be given during weeks 5 and 7. Up to 15 doses of IL-2 treatment will be given over a maximum of 5 days followed by inpatient recovery time.   -  During week 5 participants will have tumor imaging studies prior to receiving zanolimumab and IL-2 treatment.   -  About 2 weeks after the treatment period participants will return to the clinical center for a 2-day evaluation with a physical examination imaging studies and blood samples.   -  Participants whose tumors have responded to treatment will be offered up to two additional courses of treatment starting 6 to 8 weeks after the last IL-2 dose. Subsequent courses will be given exactly as described above in the initial course of treatment. Participants whose tumors do not respond to treatment will have follow-up evaluations as required by the study researchers.    ,NCT01160445
Melanoma,RFT-5-dgA in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Background:   -  CD4+ cells are white blood cells that regulate the immune system by controlling the strength and quality of the immune response.   -  CD25+ cells are a subset of CD4+ cells that suppress or prevent immune responses.   -  RFT-5-dgA is an immunotoxin (substance that kills specific cells in the immune system) that kills CD25+ cells.   -  In mouse studies RFT-5-dgA showed anti-tumor activity in animals studies. Objective: To determine whether the immune system of patients with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread beyond the original site) can cause tumors to shrink if the patients are given RFT-5-dgA to remove their CD25+ cells. Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age and older with metastatic melanoma whose disease has progressed after receiving standard treatment. Design:   -  Patients receive RFT-5-dgA through a vein every other day for a total of 3 doses (one treatment course). Patients have routine blood tests during the week of treatment.   -  Four to 5 weeks after the last dose patients are evaluated with a physical examination blood tests and scans and x-rays to evaluate their tumor.   -  Patients whose tumor has shrunk or remained stable may be offered additional treatment with RFT-5-dgA up to a total of four courses.   -  Patients undergo leukapheresis or have several tubes of blood drawn from a vein to determine the effects of RFT-5-dgA on the immune system. This is done before the first dose of RFT-5-dgA after the first three doses and possibly during subsequent treatment courses in those patients who receive additional treatment. For leukapheresis blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and flows through a catheter into a machine that separates it into its components by spinning. The white cells are extracted and the rest of the blood is returned through another needle in the other arm.    ,NCT00314093
Melanoma,Anti-gp100 Cells Plus ALVAC gp100 Vaccine to Treat Advanced Melanoma, Background:   -  gp100 is a protein that is often found in melanoma tumors.   -  An experimental procedure developed for treating patients with melanoma uses anti-gp100 cells designed to destroy their tumors. The anti-gp100 cells are created in the laboratory using the patient's own tumor cells or blood cells.   -  The treatment procedure also uses a vaccine called plaque purified canarypox vector (ALVAC) gp100 made from a virus that ordinarily infects canaries and is modified to carry a copy of the gp100 gene. The virus cannot reproduce in mammals so it cannot cause disease in humans. When the vaccine is injected into a patient it stimulates cells in the immune system that may increase the efficiency of the anti gp 100 cells. Objectives: -To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anti-gp100 cells and the ALVAC gp100 vaccine in treating patients with advanced melanoma. Eligibility: -Patients with metastatic melanoma for whom standard treatments have not been effective. Design:   -  Patients undergo scans x-rays and other tests and leukapheresis to obtain white cells for laboratory treatment.   -  Patients have 7 days of chemotherapy to prepare the immune system for receiving the gp100 cells.   -  Patients receive the ALVAC vaccine anti-gp100 cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) (an approved treatment for advanced melanoma). The anti gp100 cells are given as an infusion through a vein. The vaccine is given as injections just before the infusion of gp100 cells and again 2 weeks later. IL-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion every 8 hours for up to 5 days after the cell infusion for a maximum of 15 doses.   -  After hospital discharge patients return to the clinic for periodic follow-up with a physical examination review of treatment side effects laboratory tests and scans every 1 to 6 months.    ,NCT00610311
Melanoma,Chemotherapy Irradiation Cell Infusions and Interleukin-2 to Treat Metastatic Melanoma, Background:   -  In a study in humans with melanoma patients given total body irradiation to suppress the immune system in conjunction with chemotherapy showed a significant clinical response.   -  In previous studies about one-half of patients given tumor-fighting cells (cells created from the patient's tumor cells and grown in the laboratory) showed some anti-tumor response. Objective: To determine whether tumor-fighting cells taken from a melanoma tumor and grown in the lab can more effectively at fight melanoma when the patient's immune system is suppressed and cannot attack them. Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic melanoma who have tumor reactive cells available. Design: -Patients are assigned to one of two groups - those having received prior therapy with Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and those who have not. After five days of injections of filgrastim a medicine to stimulated the growth of white blood cells patients undergo apheresis or bone marrow harvesting or both to collect stem cells for later re-infusion. For apheresis whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and circulated through a cell-separating machine where the stem cells are extracted. The rest of the blood is returned through the same needle or a needle in the other arm. Bone marrow harvesting is done under general anesthesia. Stem cells are collected through a large needle inserted into the hipbone.-Patients' immune system cells and bone marrow function are eliminated with chemotherapy (7 days) and total body irradiation (3 days) so the patient's immune system cells will not fight the tumor-fighting cells they are given in treatment.   -  1 to 3 days after total body irradiation patients receive the tumor-fighting cells by intravenous (IV) infusion. After the cells are infused they receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) infusions every 8 hours for 5 days.   -  2 days after infusion of the tumor-fighting cells patients receive the stem cells collected earlier by apheresis.   -  Patients are evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after cell infusion to look for tumor response to treatment. Patients whose tumor has not grown return to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) every 1 to 3 months for blood tests scans and x-rays.    ,NCT00314106
Melanoma,Anti-MART-1 F5 Cells Plus ALVAC MART-1 Vaccine to Treat Advanced Melanoma, Background:   -  Melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART)-1 is a protein present in melanoma cells.   -  An experimental procedure developed for treating patients with melanoma uses the anti-MART-1 F5 gene and a type of virus to make special cells called anti-MART-1 F5 cells that are designed to destroy the patient's tumor. These cells are created in the laboratory using the patient's own tumor cells or blood cells.   -  The treatment procedure also uses a vaccine called plaque purified canarypox vector (ALVAC) MART-1 made from a virus that ordinarily infects canaries and is modified to carry a copy of the MART-1 gene. The virus cannot reproduce in mammals so it cannot cause disease in humans. When the vaccine is injected into a patient it stimulates cells in the immune system that may increase the efficiency of the anti-MART-1 F5 cells. Objectives: -To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anti-MART-1 F5 and the ALVAC vaccine in treating patients with advanced melanoma. Eligibility: -Patients 18 years of age with metastatic melanoma for whom standard treatments have not been effective. Design:   -  Patients undergo scans x-rays and other tests and leukapheresis to obtain white cells for laboratory treatment.   -  Patients have 7 days of chemotherapy to prepare the immune system for receiving the anti-MART-1 F5.   -  Patients receive the ALVAC vaccine anti-MART-1 F5 cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) (an approved treatment for advanced melanoma). The anti-MART-1 F5 cells are given as an infusion through a vein. The vaccine is given as injections just before the infusion of anti-MART-1 F5 cells and again 2 weeks later. IL-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion every 8 hours for up to 5 days after the cell infusion for a maximum of 15 doses.   -  After hospital discharge patients return to the clinic for periodic follow-up with a physical examination review of treatment side effects laboratory tests and scans every 1 to 6 months.    ,NCT00612222
Melanoma,Natural Killer Cells Plus IL-2 Following Chemotherapy to Treat Advanced Melanoma or Kidney Cancer, Background:   -  Natural killer (NK) cells are large lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) that are important in the immune response to cancer.   -  IL-2 (Aldesleukin) is a substance the body makes that controls the growth and function of many types of cells. The Food and Drug Administration has approved IL-3 for treating metastatic melanoma and kidney cancer. (Metastatic disease is cancer that has spread beyond the primary site.) Objectives: To determine the safety and effectiveness of treating metastatic melanoma and kidney cancer with laboratory-treated NK cells and IL-2. Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic melanoma or kidney cancer who have previously been treated with high-dose IL-2. Design:   -  Leukapheresis. Patients under leukapheresis to obtain NK cells for the treatment regimen. Blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and directed through a cell separator machine where white blood cells are extracted. The rest of the blood is returned to the patient through a needle in the other arm. NK cells are removed from the white blood cells and treated for re-infusion into the patient.   -  Chemotherapy. Starting 8 days before infusion of the treated NK cells patients receive intravenous (IV through a vein) infusions of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to suppress the immune system.   -  NK cell infusion. Patients receive a 30-minute IV infusion of NK cells 2 days after the last dose of chemotherapy.   -  IL-2 therapy. Within 24 hours of the NK cell infusion patients receive high-dose IL-2 as a 15-minute IV infusion every 8 hours for up to 5 days. A second cycle of IL-2 is given about 14 days after the first.   -  Blood tests and biopsy. Patients have frequent blood tests during the treatment period and may be asked to undergo a biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of tumor or lymph node) at the end of treatment to look at the effects of the treatment on the tumor immune cells.   -  Follow-up evaluation. Patients are evaluated 4-6 weeks after completing treatment. They have a physical examination scans of tumor sites blood tests and blood sampling (or leukapheresis) to examine the response to treatment. Patients who improve with treatment return for evaluations every month. Those whose tumor grows again after originally shrinking may receive one additional treatment course.    ,NCT00328861
Melanoma,Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Background:   -  The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors growing them in the laboratory in large numbers and then giving the cells back to the patient with aldesleukin (IL-2) a drug that keeps the white blood cells active. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma.   -  This study will use chemotherapy to prepare the immune system before this white blood cell treatment. Our prior studies indicate that aldesleukin may not be required for cell transfer. Objectives: - To see if chemotherapy and white blood cell therapy without aldesleukin is a safe and effective treatment for metastatic melanoma. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age and less than or equal to 70 years of age with metastatic melanoma. Design:   -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institute of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination scans x-rays lab tests and other tests as needed.   -  Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.   -  Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}   -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.   -  Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam review of side effects lab tests and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.    ,NCT01468818
Melanoma,Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Background:   -  The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors growing them in the laboratory in large numbers and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 400 patients with melanoma.   -  In this trial we are determining if there is a difference in the response between patients who have received prior anti-PD1 treatment to those who have not received this prior ant-PD1 treatment. Objectives: - To determine if there is a difference in the rate of response between patients who have received prior anti-PD1 and those who have not. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years of age who have metastatic melanoma. Design:   -  Work up stage: Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

Melanoma,Prospective Randomized Study of Cell Therapy for Metastatic Melanoma Using Short-Term Cultured Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Plus IL-2 Following Either a Non-Myeloablative Lymphocyte Depleting Chemotherapy Regimen Alone or in Conjunction w/1200 TBI, Background: - An experimental treatment for metastatic melanoma involves cell therapy in which researchers take white blood cells (lymphocytes) from the tumor tissue grow them in the laboratory in large numbers and then use the cells to attack the tumor tissue. Before receiving the cells chemotherapy is needed to temporarily suppress the immune system to improve the chances that the tumor-fighting cells will be able to survive in the body. In some studies of cell therapy individuals who have received total body irradiation (TBI) in addition to the chemotherapy (in order to increase the length of time that they do not produce white blood cells) seem to have a slightly better response to the treatment but it is not known if adding radiation to the cell therapy will cause a better response for all individuals. Researchers are interested in comparing cell therapy given with the usual chemotherapy to cell therapy given with the usual chemotherapy and TBI. Objectives: - To compare the effectiveness of cell therapy given with chemotherapy to cell therapy given with chemotherapy and total body irradiation in individuals with metastatic melanoma. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination medical history blood tests and tumor imaging studies.   -  Participants will be divided into two groups: cell therapy with chemotherapy alone (group 1) or cell therapy with chemotherapy plus TBI (group 2).   -  All participants will provide a tumor sample from either surgery or a tumor biopsy for white blood cell collection.   -  Participants will have leukapheresis to collect additional white blood cells for cell growth and future testing and TBI group participants will also provide stem cells to help them recover after radiation. (TBI participants who cannot provide enough stem cells will be moved to the non-radiation treatment group.)   -  Participants will have chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (two treatments over 2 days) and fludarabine (five treatments over 5 days) starting 7 days before the cell therapy. Participants in the TBI group will also have TBI for the 3 days immediately before the cell therapy.   -  All participants will receive the white blood cells followed by high-dose aldesleukin every 8 hours for up to 5 days after the cell infusion to help keep the therapy cells alive and active. Participants will also have injections of filgrastim to stimulate blood cell production and participants in the TBI group will also receive their stem cells.   -  Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months after treatment to prevent pneumonia and will be asked to return for regular monitoring and followup visits for at least 5 years to evaluate the tumor s response to treatment....    ,NCT01319565
Melanoma,In Vivo Persistence of Adoptively-Transferred TIL Cultured With Akti in People With Metastatic Melanoma, Background: - One cancer therapy involves taking white blood cells from a person changing them in a lab and then giving the cells back to the person. These cells are called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Researchers want to grow some of the TIL cells with the drug Akti to see if they live longer than those grown without it. Objectives: - To see if TIL cells grown with Akti live longer than those grown without it. Eligibility: - Adults 18 70 with metastatic melanoma Design:   -  Participants will:   -  Be screened with tests including scans x-rays heart and lung tests blood and urine tests and a <TAB>possible colonoscopy.   -  Have tumor surgery or biopsy.   -  Have a large catheter inserted into a vein in the upper chest.   -  Receive leukapheresis for 4 5 hours.

The rest of the blood is returned by needle in the other arm.   -  The cells will be changed in a laboratory.   -  Participants will check into the hospital and:   -  For 5 days get 1 2 chemotherapy drugs by catheter.   -  For 1 3 days get the changed cells by catheter.   -  For several days get 2 drugs to stimulate cells one by injection the other by catheter.   -  For 7 12 days recover in the hospital.   -  After treatment participants will:   -  Take an antibiotic and antiviral for at least 6 months.   -  Return to NIH for several 2-day visits for a few years. At each visit participants will have lab tests imaging studies and a physical exam. At some visits they may have leukapheresis or blood tests.    ,NCT02489266
Melanoma,Use of IL-15 After Chemotherapy and Lymphocyte Transfer in Metastatic Melanoma, Background: - Researchers have developed an experimental cancer treatment called cell therapy. White blood cells called lymphocytes are taken from a tumor grown in large numbers in the lab and then given back to the patient. Interleukin-15 given to the patient after the cells (now called Young tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of Young TIL cells) are replaced helps the cells to grow and boosts the immune system. This process changes your normal cells into cells that are able to recognize your tumor has been studied in the lab. These cells can destroy tumor cells in the test tube but scientists want to see if they work inside the body. Objectives: -To test the effectiveness of lymphocytes drawn from tumor cells combined with interleukin-15 in treating metastatic melanoma. Eligibility:   -  Patients must be 18 - 66 years of age and have a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.   -  They will have heart and lung function tests lab tests and imaging procedures.   -  Patients may not have conditions such as active systemic infections blood clotting disorders or other active major medical illnesses.   -  Patients may not be pregnant or nursing.    ,NCT01369888
Melanoma,Melanoma Treatment With White Blood Cells That Destroy MART Expressing Tumor Cells, Background: - Some cancer treatments collect a patient s own blood cells to use as specialized cancer-fighting cells. Collected white blood cells known as PBL (peripheral blood lymphocytes) can use to isolate special cells that can fight tumors. Before treatment with PBL chemotherapy is given to destroy existing white blood cells so that the new cells can survive and attack the tumors. After PBL treatment aldesleukin is given to help the new cells grow. Researchers want to see if special white blood cells that recognize a specific protein that is present in melanoma cells (melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART)) can cause tumors to shrink. These white blood cells will be tested with and without aldesleukin. Objectives:   -  To test the safety and effectiveness of white blood cells that target MART in the treatment of melanoma.   -  To test white blood cells that target MART with and without aldesleukin. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have melanoma that has not responded to standard treatments. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine samples will be taken. Imaging studies such as x-rays or magnetic resonance imaging scans will be performed.   -  Participants will provide white blood cells through leukapheresis. Researchers will attempt to isolate white blood cells that recognize MART   -  Seven days before the start of treatment participants will have chemotherapy.   -  After the last dose of chemotherapy participants will receive the MART reactive PBL cells. Filgrastim doses will also be given to help white blood cell counts return to normal. Participants will have frequent blood tests.   -  Participants who are able to have aldesleukin treatment will start within 24 hours after receiving the MART reactive PBL cells. Treatment will continue for up to 5 days.   -  Participants may have an optional tumor or lymph node biopsy to study the effects of treatment.   -  If the tumor continues to grow after MART PBL treatment participants may have one more round of cell collection and treatment.   -  Participants will have followup visits for up to 6 months after receiving the MART reactive PBL treatment.    ,NCT01495572
Melanoma,Modified Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Metastatic Melanoma, Background: - Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are white blood cells that have been taken from tumor tissue. The cells are modified to help them kill tumor cells then given back to the person with cancer. By giving these cells to patients researchers hope to improve the current treatments available for patients with melanoma that has not responded to standard therapies. The TIL will be given after treatments that will suppress the immune system. This makes it easier for the TIL to attack the cancer cells. The TIL will also be given with aldesleukin (IL-2) which is designed to help keep the TIL cells alive in the body. Objectives: - To study the safety and effectiveness of specially modified tumor infiltrating lymphocytes to treat melanoma that has not responded to other treatments. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have metastatic melanoma that has not responded to other treatments. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood tests and imaging studies.   -  A piece of tumor will be collected and white blood cells will be separated to make the TIL for the treatment.   -  Participants will take drugs to suppress the immune system for 7 days before the start of treatment.   -  Participants will receive the TIL in a single dose. Then they will receive IL-2 every 8 hours for up to 15 doses. Participants will remain in the hospital for up to 2 weeks after treatment. They will be monitored with frequent blood tests and other studies.   -  After leaving the hospital participants will have regular followup visits every 1 to 4 months for the first year. Then they will return for followup every 3 to 4 months as directed by the study researchers.    ,NCT01369875
Melanoma,Vemurafenib and TIL Therapy for Metastatic Melanoma, Background: Adoptive T cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has been reported to induce durable clinical responses in patients with metastatic melanoma. From patients own tumor material T cells are extracted expanded and activated in vitro in a 4-6 weeks culture period. Before TIL infusion patients are preconditioned with a lymphodepleting chemotherapeutic regimen. After TIL infusion patients are treated with IL-2 to support T cell activation and expansion in vivo. The BRAF inhibitor is an approved treatment of metastatic melanoma and functions by selectively inhibiting the BRAF mutated enzyme consequently halting the proliferation of tumor cells. Furthermore in vitro tests have shown that vemurafenib has immunomodulatory effects that are hypothesized to synergize with TIL therapy which has been confirmed in animal studies. Objectives:   -  To evaluate safety and feasibility when combining vemurafenib and ACT with TILs.   -  To evaluate treatment related immune responses   -  To evaluate clinical efficacy Design:   -  Patients will be screened with a physical exam medical history blood samples and ECG.   -  Patients will start vemurafenib 960 mg BID and will continue during TIL preparation.   -  7 days after start of vemurafenib patients will undergo surgery to harvest tumor material for TIL production.   -  Patient stops vemurafenib and is admitted day -8 in order to undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludara starting day -7.   -  On day 0 patients receive TIL infusion and shortly after starts IL-2 infusion continually following the decrescendo regimen.   -  The patients will followed until progression or up to 5 years.    ,NCT02354690
Melanoma,Mechanism of Action of High-Dose IL-2 (Aldesleukin) in Metastatic Melanoma and Kidney Cancer, Background: -Although IL-2 can shrink tumors in about 20 percent of patients with metastatic kidney cancer and in 15 percent of patients with metastatic melanoma it is not fully known how the drug works. Objectives: -To better understand how IL-2 causes tumors to shrink. Eligibility: -Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic kidney cancer or metastatic melanoma Design:   -  135 patients with melanoma and 110 patients with kidney cancer may be enrolled.   -  Patients are hospitalized for about 7 days for each treatment. They receive IL-2 intravenously (through a vein) over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 4 days or 12 doses. This constitutes one treatment cycle.   -  Research blood samples are collected daily during the first treatment cycle and for one or two days following the last dose.   -  Patients may be asked to undergo leukapheresis a procedure for collecting large quantities of white blood cells. This involves collecting blood through a needle in an arm vein. The blood is directed through a cell separator where the white cells are extracted. The rest of the blood (red cells platelets and plasma) is returned to the patient through the same needle or through a needle in the other arm.   -  About 7-10 days after discharge from the hospital patients return for a second treatment cycle but without research blood sampling.   -  2 months after therapy patients are evaluated with scans and x-rays and blood tests to evaluate the tumor and the effects of the treatment on immune cells.   -  Patients whose tumors shrink or remain stable may continue treatment (without repeating the full set of research blood samples) as long as they benefit from the treatment and do not develop unacceptable side effects. Patients who continue treatment are evaluated every 2 months for 3 to 4 times and then every 3 to 6 months.    ,NCT00304460
Melanoma,Chemotherapy Followed by ESO-1 Lymphocytes and Aldesleukin to Treat Metastatic Cancer, Background: -This study uses an experimental cancer treatment that uses the patient s own lymphocytes (type of white blood cell) which are specially selected and genetically modified to target and destroy their tumor. Objectives: -To test the safety of the treatment and determine if it can cause the patient s tumor to shrink. Eligibility:   -  Patients greater than 18 years and less than or equal to 66 years of age whose cancer has spread beyond the original site and does not respond to standard treatment.   -  Patients have tissue type human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201.   -  Patients cancer cells have the ESO-1 gene. Design:   -  Workup: Patients have scans x-rays laboratory tests and other tests as needed.   -  Patients have leukapheresis to collect cells for laboratory treatment and later reinfusion. For this procedure whole blood is collected thorough a tube in a vein the desired cells are extracted from the blood and the rest of the blood is returned to the patient.   -  Chemotherapy: Patients have low-dose chemotherapy for 1 week to prepare the immune system to receive the treated lymphocytes.   -  Cell infusion and aldesleukin (IL-2) treatment: Patients receive the lymphocytes by a 30-minute infusion through a vein. Starting within 24 hours of the infusion they receive high-dose aldesleukin infusions every 8 hours for up to 5 days (maximum15 doses).   -  Recovery: Patients rest for 1 to 2 weeks to recover from the effects of chemotherapy and aldesleukin.   -  Tumor biopsy: Patients may be asked to undergo a biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of tumor) after treatment to look at the effects of treatment on the immune cells in the tumor.   -  Follow-up: After treatment is completed patients return to the clinic once a month for several months for physical examinations a review of side effects laboratory tests and scans. They may undergo leukapheresis at some visits to look at the effect of treatment on the immune system and check the viability of the infused cells. Patients then return to the National Institute of Health (NIH) clinic once a year for 5 years and then complete a follow-up questionnaire for another 10 years.   -  Retreatment: Patients whose tumor shrinks or disappears following treatment and then recurs may receive one additional treatment using the same regimen of chemotherapy lymphocyte infusion and IL-2 treatment.    ,NCT00670748
Melanoma,Study of Everolimus With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Based on data demonstrating synergy between paclitaxel and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition the investigators propose that the addition of everolimus to paclitaxel with carboplatin should lead to improvements in efficacy as measured by progression-free survival and response rate.    ,NCT01014351
Melanoma,Combination Therapy With Nivolumab and PD-L1/IDO Peptide Vaccine to Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Combination therapy is becoming more and more general in the treatment of oncological diseases. In this clinical trial combination the standard immunotherapeutic treatment; the programmed death 1 (PD-1) regulatory antibody Nivolumab and a peptide vaccine consisting of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Indoleamine 23-dioxygenase (IDO) peptides will be tested in patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients will be treated with Nivolumab every second week as long as there is clinical benefit. The PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine is given from start of Nivolumab and every second week for the first 6 vaccines and thereafter every fourth week up to 1 year.    ,NCT03047928
Melanoma,Dendritic Cell Vaccines + Dasatinib for Metastatic Melanoma, Current therapeutic approaches available for patients with advanced-stage melanoma remain inadequate and existing approaches including those involving immunotherapy with cytokines and/or targeted strategies have resulted in disappointingly low rates of durable and complete responses. Correcting immune dysfunction in advanced-stage melanoma patients using tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as dasatinib is proposed to relicense the patient's immune system to respond optimally to specific immunization. The integration of antigens expressed by tumor-associated blood vessel cells provides a means to selectively target the genetically-/antigenically-heterogeneous population of tumor cells in the advanced-stage melanoma patient. This is a single-center prospective randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the activity safety and immune effects of dasatinib given in combination with an autologous type-1 polarized Dendritic Cell (αDC1) vaccine. The current trial represents a randomized Phase 2 study to determine the activity and safety of intradermal (id) administration of αDC1s loaded with a mixture of six TBVA-derived peptides at the time of or immediately after an initial therapy cycle with the TKI dasatinib. Dasatinib will be administered at the standard dose and schedule recommended by the FDA (70 mg BID). The autologous type-I DC vaccine will be administered either prior to or concomitant with the initiation of dasatinib administration. All patients will receive dasatinib at a starting dose of 70 mg twice daily by mouth in the outpatient setting approximately every 12 hours at the same time each day. The DC vaccine will be administered by a single intradermal injection of approximately 10e7 cells with all the DCs being administered on days 1 and 15 of every cycle on an outpatient basis in the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Research Center (UPCI-CTRC). Patients on Arm A will start dasatinib administration on cycle 2 day 1 (week 5) while those patients in Arm B will start dasatinib administration on cycle 1 day 1 (week 1). Men and women at least 18 years of age must be HLA-A2+ and have histologically confirmed melanoma that is metastatic (Stage IV) or unresectable Stage IIIB/C and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.    ,NCT01876212
Melanoma,Peptide Vaccination Associated With Tumoral Immunomodulation in Patients With Advanced Metastatic Melanoma, Human cancers express tumor antigens that can be targeted by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). These antigens consist of a small peptide derived from endogenous proteins that is presented at the cancer cell's surface by an HLA class I molecule. Such antigenic peptides including MAGE-3.A1 and NA17.A2 have been tested in experimental therapeutic vaccines to elicit CTL responses in cancer patients mainly with metastatic melanoma. Up to now only rare tumor responses have been observed. Tumor resistance to CTL killing is the most likely explanation for the poor effectiveness of cancer vaccines. This resistance is probably acquired by the tumor during its development and selected by its repetitive challenge with spontaneous anti-tumoral immune responses. The precise molecular mechanisms of tumor resistance remain unknown. The observation that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) purified from melanoma metastases can recognize and kill autologous tumor cells in vitro whilst they seem unable to control tumor growth in vivo suggests that this resistance is hosted by the tumor environment rather than being the result of a generalized immune suppression. The investigators have developed a murine model of cutaneous graft rejection that mimics the situation in melanoma. Female CBA mice do not reject syngeneic male skin grafts even though they mount a spontaneous CTL response against H-Y a male specific minor histocompatibility antigen following grafting. The investigators have tested various experimental procedures aimed at inducing effective graft rejection in these mice. This was obtained with a combination of IFN-α IL-2 GM-CSF each administered separately under the skin graft associated with topical applications of imiquimod. All these agents are available as registered drugs. Based on this murine model of cutaneous allograft rejection the investigators postulate that local immunomodulation with this combination can trigger an effective tumor rejection process and induce a more efficient and long-lasting anti-tumoral immune response following peptide vaccination.    ,NCT01191034
Melanoma,Study Comparing TIL to Standard Ipilimumab in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, In this randomized controlled phase III study the investigators will evaluate whether TIL infusion preceded by non-myeloablative chemotherapy and followed by high dose bolus interleukin-2 can result in an improved progression free survival when randomly compared to ipilimumab in 168 stage IV melanoma patients. A health technology assessment (HTA) will be performed to evaluate the impact of the TIL treatment on patients and organizational processes and cost-effectivity.    ,NCT02278887
Melanoma,Study of Immune Responses in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, In this study anti-OX40 will be given to patients with melanoma to find out how the immune system responds to treatment with anti-OX40. It is hoped that this treatment will cause an immune response against melanoma resulting in tumor regression but this is not known at this time. Anti-OX40 is a large protein that can help immune cells that fight bacteria viruses and cancer cells.    ,NCT01416844
Melanoma,Isolated Limb Perfusion of Melphalan for Melanoma and Sarcoma Treatment, In-transit metastases occur in approximately 3% of melanoma patients can be very symptomatic and the survival in this group may be prolonged. In-transit melanoma metastases are often confined to a limb. In this circumstance treatment by isolated limb perfusion or isolated limb infusion can be a remarkably effective regional treatment option. Isolated limb infusion (ILI) was introduced in 1992 and is a technique used to deliver regional chemotherapy to treat advanced melanoma confined to a limb. Regional chemotherapy with melphalan delivered by isolated limb perfusion (ILP) or ILI are effective treatment options for in-transit melanoma and are generally well tolerated. ILI is a less invasive and simpler alternative to ILP. Complete response rates are 45- 69% for ILP and 23-44% for ILI. The limb is often warmed to lower temperatures in ILI compared to ILP and the limb becomes progressively more hypoxic and acidotic during ILI each of these parameters potentially having an effect on outcome. ILP & ILI are used primarily as palliative options when excision of in-transit metastases is unfeasible but can be used as an adjunctive procedure to surgery for other tumour types such as merkel cell carcinoma and can be repeated if indicated. For ILI correction of melphalan dose for ideal body weight has been shown to substantially decrease the rates of severe local toxicity while maintaining complete response rates but overall response rate is reduced. Response to ILI moreover is different in upper and lower limbs. ILI for Upper limbs disease is associated with similar complete response rates but lower toxicity than ILI for Lower limbs E disease and with different physiologic sequelae despite comparable methods. The Upper limbs appears relatively resistant to toxic effects of melphalan-based ILI as currently performed which suggests a potential for further optimization of drug dosing for Upper limbs ILI. Regional therapy is an excellent therapeutic modality for disease limited to a limb and furthermore serves as an excellent model for scientific investigation both clinical and translational. In this study we want to collect data on isolated limb infusion of chemotherapy to monitor efficacy and tolerability in patients with melanoma metastases of the arm or leg that cannot be removed by surgery.    ,NCT01920516
Melanoma,A Phase 3 Study to Compare Efficacy and Safety of Masitinib to Dacarbazine in the Treatment of Patients With Non-Resectable or Metastatic Stage 3 or Stage 4 Melanoma Carrying a Mutation in the Juxta Membrane Domain of C-Kit, Masitinib is a novel TKI that potently inhibits wild type (WT) c-kit and its activated form mutated in the juxtamembrane region (JM c-kit) PDGFRs the intracellular kinase Lyn and to a lesser extent fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Pre-clinical data suggest that masitinib is a strong candidate for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma carrying a c-kit JM mutation.    ,NCT01280565
Melanoma,Interest of the 18F-DOPA-PET Imaging in Metastatic Melanoma Treated With B-RAF Inhibitors: a Pilot Study, Melanoma incidence is increasing in most developed countries. At the metastatic stage the prognosis is usually poor. Major advances have been obtained over the last 3 years with the development of therapies targeting the MAP kinases pathway. Vemurafenib (zelboraf®) is approved in France since 2012 as first treatment of metastatic melanoma carrying a B-RAF mutation. For growth the tumor needs an adequate supply of nutrients to allow the synthesis of macromolecules and a contribution in carbon elements to ensure the production of energy. The nutrition demand is met through greater availability of nutrients via tumor angiogenesis and through increased intracellular penetration of nutrients via specific upregulation of transport systems and metabolic pathways. Scanner is the imaging method most commonly used for the evaluation of therapeutic response. Such a method gives a morphological indication but does not evaluate the metabolic response. With the development of functional imaging techniques and the advent of positron emission tomography (PET) it is now possible to obtain an assessment of the metabolic activity of tumors. The use of 18F-FDG to assess therapeutic responses to targeted therapies is fairly recent. The advantage of this approach is well documented for GIST and non-small cell lung cancer. In melanoma the metabolic response to 18F-FDG is much faster than the response to TAP scanner. 18F-FDG tracer that targets glucose metabolism is the most sensitive functional imaging in melanoma which has hindered the development of other tracers such as 18F-FDOPA and 18F-FLT. The 18F-FDG TEP can thus be used in the initial staging and follow-up of the disease a situation in which it can replace the TAP scanner additional brain imaging remaining necessary. The use of metabolic imaging to study the response to targeted therapies in melanoma has been the subject of only one publications. There was a trend toward improved progression-free survival in patients with high metabolic response at day J15. For melanoma the diagnostic sensitivity of PET 18F-FDOPA is lower than that of 18F-FDG (64% versus 95%). In contrast the 18F-FDOPA tracer has the advantage of allowing a brain assessment which is critical in melanoma that gives frequent metastases in the central nervous system. There has never been any evaluation of the metabolic response to targeted therapies such as BRAF inhibitors PET with 18F-FDOPA. The investigators propose to conduct a monocentric prospective preliminary study to explore the potential usefulness of the metabolic PET imaging with 18F-FDOPA in the evaluation of metabolic response of B-RAF mutated metastatic melanoma treated with vemurafenib.    ,NCT02038348
Melanoma,The Role of Peptide-loaded Dendritic Cells to Augment the Therapeutic Effect of Interleukin-2, Melanoma is the main cause of death in patients with skin cancer. Once it has metastasized this cancer has been shown to respond to chemotherapy only in rare cases. Immunotherapy represents an approach to treatment based on the immune response to cancer antigens. The principal objective of the study is to identify whether a dendritic cell-based vaccine can increase the moderate therapeutic effect of bolus high dose IL-2 in patients with metastatic melanoma. For this purposepatients with metastatic melanoma who have a certain blood type (HLA-A201+) will be treated systemically with high dose IL-2. In one group of patients the IL-2 will be preceded by three doses of autologous dendritic cell pulsed with melanoma antigens appropriate for their blood type. Two cycles of three DC vaccines will be administered every 14 days by intra-lymph node injections followed by high dose IL-2 treatment. Responding patients will receive additional DC vaccines at 1 month and 2 months intervals. In a second group patients will receive the standard high dose IL-2 protocol within a comparable period of time. Each group will include 12 patients. A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be performed prior to accrual after initial 3 DC vaccines six weeks after first IL-2 treatment after a total of 6 DC vaccines and 6 weeks after second cycle of IL-2 treatment.    ,NCT00279058
Melanoma,Adoptive Cell Therapy Following Non-myeloablate Chemotherapy in Metastatic Melanoma Patients, Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive and highly malignant cancer. The five-year survival rate of patients with metastatic disease is less than 5% with a median survival of only 6-10 months. Drugs like Dacarbazin (DTIC) as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents have a response rate of 15-30% but the duration of response is usually short with no impact on survival. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) based immunotherapy has shown more promising results. This form of therapy has a similar response rate with some patients achieving a durable complete response. Recently the National Institute of Health (NIH) reported that by using lympho-depleting chemotherapy followed by an adoptive transfer of large numbers of anti-tumor specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) an objective regression was achieved in 51% of patients with metastatic melanoma. Objectives: To introduce the TIL technology to advanced metastatic melanoma patients in Israel.    ,NCT00287131
Melanoma,A Phase I/II Study of GMX1777 in Combination With Temozolomide for the Treatment of Metastatic Melanoma, Obatoclax Mesylate (GMX1777) is a water-soluble intravenously-administered pro-drug of GMX1778. GMX1777 is rapidly converted to GMX1778 in vivo. GMX1778 has potent anti-tumor activity against a variety of cell lines and models from different tumor origins.    ,NCT00724841
Melanoma,Local Modulation of Immune Receptors to Enhance the Response to Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Metastatic Melanoma, Our proposed study is designed to test the safety of a new vaccine against melanoma. The induction of immune activity against cancers such as melanoma is a promising approach to cancer treatment but to date only a few clinically significant immune responses have been seen following vaccine therapy. This is an important problem since there are very limited treatment options for patients with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread to lymph nodes and organs). Studies suggest that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block inhibitory receptors on immune cells can enhance the immune responses against cancer but the intravenous injection of such mAbs has caused severe side effects in animals and humans. In our laboratory we have developed a method to deliver mAbs and other proteins that block such inhibitory receptors locally at the site where immune responses against melanoma proteins are stimulated by vaccination enhancing anti-melanoma immunity while avoiding the side-effects associated with intravenous injection of these immune modulators. This is achieved by loading dendritic cells a type of immune cell with RNA that encodes the immune modulator. The RNA-loaded dendritic cells then make the immune modulatory proteins and release them locally. By mixing these dendritic cells with additional dendritic cells loaded with melanoma proteins the immune modulators are released at the site where anti-melanoma immune cells are stimulated. In this phase I trial subjects with metastatic melanoma will undergo the process of leukapheresis in which white blood cells are removed from the body. Monocytes a type of immune cell will then be purified from the white blood cells and cultured under conditions that will change them into dendritic cells. Half of these dendritic cells are then loaded with melanoma antigen RNA which will lead to the production of melanoma antigen proteins within the dendritic cells. The remaining half of the dendritic cells will be either untreated or loaded with RNA encoding immune modulators so that these dendritic cells will release immune modulators at the site of vaccination. These dendritic cells will be mixed with the melanoma antigen-loaded dendritic cells and injected as a vaccine into lymph nodes. Each subject will receive six weekly injections of their own dendritic cells. Safety and toxicity will be closely monitored. In addition immune responses against melanoma as well as clinical responses will be assessed.    ,NCT01216436
Melanoma,Whole Brain Radiotherapy Following Local Treatment of Intracranial Metastases of Melanoma, People with brain metastases from melanoma are offered different treatment options after local treatment of their brain metastases via surgery or stereotactic irradiation. Depending on the treating institution and the clinician involved a patient may or may not be offered whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) after their brain metastases are excised or treated with stereotactic irradiation. This trial seeks to determine if WBRT reduces the spread of brain metastases and lengthens the time to recurrence. The trial also examines the effect of WBRT on quality of life and brain functions such as memory speech and concentration. Participants will be randomised after local treatment of their brain metastases to either WBRT or observation. 220 people will be recruited from sites in Australia Norway the UK the US and other international sites.    ,NCT01503827
Melanoma,HD IL-2 + Ipilimumab in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Phase IV open-label randomized two-arm multi-center study in patients with metastatic melanoma who are treatment naïve or have previously received a single non-immunologic therapy. Treatment Arm 1: Patients will receive two courses (four cycles) of High Dose Interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) followed by one course (four doses) of ipilimumab. Treatment Arm 2: Patients will receive one course (four doses) of ipilimumab followed by two courses (four cycles) of HD IL-2. HD IL-2 and ipilimumab dosing regimens will comply with the instructions in the most current package inserts institutional guidelines and medical expertise of the treating physician. However neither the ipilimumab nor the HD IL-2 should be dose reduced. If necessary doses should be either held or permanently discontinued (per package insert instructions). Protocol specific dosing guidance is included in the 12PLK02 Work Instructions. Patients will be scheduled for four response assessments. Response assessment timing should be targeted to fall within the following time points: between 5-11 weeks 13-19 weeks 24-30 weeks and one year after initiating therapy in either treatment arm. Timing of the response assessments may be adjusted to facilitate clinical procedures and treatment decisions. Patient treatment tolerability and safety events will be monitored and managed while enrolled in the 12PLK02 study. Patients who receive HD IL-2 in the 12PLK02 study will be enrolled in the PROCLAIM study (Registry Protocol 10PLK13) for the collection of long-term assessment data including response and disease status and treatment decisions. Patient treatment data will be entered in to the PROCLAIM database for a minimum target of 2 years and potentially up to 5 years after the patient completes the 12PLK02 study.    ,NCT01856023

Melanoma,Treatment of Metastatic Melanoma With Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes and IL-2 Following Lympho-depleting Chemotherapy, Prior preclinical and clinical studies have shown that tumors from patients with advanced melanoma contain tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with anti-tumor reactivity. These TIL can be expanded in the laboratory to large numbers and reinfused to the patient. Using a chemotherapy regimen that selectively kills lymphocytes a single institution Phase II study of 35 patients showed a 51% objective response rate to TIL and interleukin-2 injection. In the present trial we would like to investigate whether we can achieve similar results in a Hadassah Phase II study and to determine the feasibility of applying this approach to patients with advanced melanoma who currently have few treatment options.    ,NCT00604136

Melanoma,Study of MAGE-3/Melan-A/gp 100/NA17 and rhIL-12 With/Out Low Dose IL-2 in Metastatic Melanoma, Purpose of investigation: Primary hypotheses: Immunization of patients with 4 melanoma antigen peptides will induce augmented specific IFN-y-producing CD8+ T cells against all 4 antigens simultaneously. Immunization with 4 melanoma antigen peptides will increase the response rate from 10% to 30%. Administration of low-dose IL-2 following each vaccine will result in a greater than 3-fold increase in specific T cells compared to no IL-2. Secondary hypotheses: Immunization will clear the blood of detectable circulating melanoma cells. Tumors that grow despite induction of melanoma antigen-specific T cells may lack expression of antigens class I MHC or the TAP peptide transporter or may fail to show increased expression of mRNA for IFN-y or perforin. Tumors that resist vaccination may express a different array of genes than those that are susceptible to vaccination.    ,NCT00203879

Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving temozolomide together with sunitinib malate may kill more tumor cells. Phase II was never conducted due to toxicity in phase I. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sunitinib malate when given together with temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III or stage IV malignant melanoma.    ,NCT01005472
Melanoma,Study of Molecular Mechanisms Implicated in the Pathogenesis of Melanoma. Role of Exosomes, Recent progresses have been made in the treatment of metastatic melanoma nevertheless improved patient survival is still limited because of primary resistance and relapses. It is therefore important to continue to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in melanoma development and progression to improve the management of patients. Drugs such as the alkylating agents (temozolomide and fotemustine) or vemurafenib trigger senescence-like phenotypes in melanoma cells. It is now known that senescent cells secrete some factors that exert a pro-tumoral role but the potential existence and the role of insoluble factors remain undetermined. Preliminary results from the investigators laboratory indicate the presence in the senescent secretome of exosomes; microvesicles involved in intercellular communication immunomodulatory functions and tumorigenesis. Several studies showed that these vesicles shape the tumor microenvironment and contribute to the migration of cancer cells. Their interest in oncology as a prognostic factor and marker of therapeutic response is increasing. Thus our project aims to study the effect of exosomes produced by senescent melanoma cells in the development and progression of melanoma in vitro and in vivo using cell cultures and animal models. In addition the investigator propose a pilot study whose objective is to determine the effect of vemurafenib on nanovesicles produced by patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The investigator hope to show that exosomes participate in the process of drug resistance and relapse with the goal of developing (with the exosomes study) theranostic tools for personalized care in patients.    ,NCT02310451

Melanoma,Standard Palliative Care Versus Standard Palliative Care Plus Polychemotherapy in Metastasized Malignant Melanoma, The purpose of this multicenter study is to examine whether the proposed randomized treatment regime results in a significantly longer survival time and higher quality of life than any additionally applied multiple chemotherapy according to the CVD- scheme. So far neither established treatment regimes nor reliable data exist for the second-line chemotherapy of metastatic malignant melanoma. Patients are therefore mostly treated with single or multiple chemotherapeutics or/and immunomodulatory therapeutics. These regimes however imply often not only a higher toxicity but show rarely a response rate higher than 10%.    ,NCT00226473
Melanoma,Study of Gene Modified Immune Cells in Patients With Advanced Melanoma, The purpose of this phase 2 study is to find the best way to give this new experimental regimen and determine if it can treat metastatic melanoma in humans. In this phase 2 study the experimental products are given initially to a group of 8 people. If safe and found to have significant anti-tumor activity it will be given to up to 14 other people for a total of 22 people in this study. Physicians watch subjects carefully for any harmful side effects. Although the experimental regimen has been well tested in laboratory and animal studies and a similar regimen has been given to a group of patients at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda MD the side effects in people cannot be completely known ahead of time. This protocol is offered only to people whose condition cannot be helped by other known treatments. The study procedures will start with the collection of white blood cells through apheresis (a procedure in which blood is drawn from a patient and separated into its components some of which are retained such as white blood cells and the remainder returned by transfusion to the patient). Subjects will be asked to undergo two aphereses one to make the gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs and the dendritic cell vaccines and a second one after the subject receives the gene modified cells to later study them in the blood. On the day of the first apheresis subjects will be admitted to the hospital and will receive chemotherapy over the next five days which decreases the risk of rejection of the transferred cells by the subject's immune system and facilitates their expansion and attack of the melanoma lesions. During this time the gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs and the dendritic cells will be manufactured in the laboratory from the apheresis product and will be extensively tested to assure that they express the appropriate TCR and that they do not contain any contaminating bacteria or virus. Then the gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs will be given back to the subject through a vein in the arm. It will be followed by vaccination with the dendritic cells under the skin. During the next fourteen days subjects will also receive interleukin 2 (IL-2) which is a standard treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. During the next 2 to 3 weeks subjects will stay in the hospital until the study investigators determine that the subject has fully recovered from all of the procedures and it is safe for the subject to go home. Chemotherapy frequently causes a decrease in the platelet or red blood cells and therefore subjects may require platelet and/or red blood cell transfusions.    ,NCT00910650

Melanoma,A Study of Everolimus in Combination With Imatinib in Metastatic Melanoma, The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of everolimus and imatinib will slow the growth of or cause a reduction in the size of the cancer and to determine the side effects of the combination in patients with melanoma. Each of the drugs in this combination if used alone would not be expected to have an effect against the cancer. However when used together there is a possibility that they could work together to damage the cancer cells or to block the formation or function of the blood vessels that feed the cancer either of which could result in slowing the growth of or shrinking the cancer. Both drugs work by blocking signals that are sent from outside of a cell to the inside of the cell that direct the cell to make certain substances to keep the cell alive. Cancer cells or blood vessels that feed cancer cells may be more sensitive to drugs that block these signals.    ,NCT00402662

Melanoma,Radiotherapy & Combi in Metastatic Melanoma, The purpose of this study is to investigate the side effects and safety and effectiveness of combining dabrafenib and trametinib with radiotherapy. Previous and ongoing clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of combining both dabrafenib and trametinib compared with dabrafenib alone. This has led to the approval for the use of both drugs in combination in people with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF mutation. Melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body may also benefit from radiotherapy to help reduce symptoms from melanoma. Previous studies have shown that melanoma may be sensitive to radiotherapy and that it can help to improve quality of life. The intention of the CombiRT study is to establish if dabrafenib trametinib and radiotherapy combined is a safe and effective treatment for metastatic melanoma.    ,NCT02392871
Melanoma,Clinical Trial of Sutent to Treat Metastatic Melanoma," The purpose of this study is to investigate whether an investigational drug called sunitinib malate is safe and effective in treating metastatic melanoma in patients with KIT mutations. KIT is a gene that ""codes for"" (contains the genetic code that the body uses to make) a protein on the surface of cells in your body that is important in cell growth and cell division. The KIT protein seems to play a role in abnormal cell growth seen in acute leukemia germ cell tumors gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and certain melanomas. Melanomas that arise on acral skin (palms soles nail beds) mucosal membranes and chronically sun damaged skin have recently been found to frequently contain mutations or increased copy numbers of the KIT gene. Your tumor tissue has previously been tested and has been found to contain abnormalities in the KIT gene. Sunitinib malate is drug that has been shown to inhibit the activity of the KIT protein. The FDA approved sunitinib in 2006 for patients with GIST. It has been shown that sunitinib malate works in these patients because of its activity against the KIT protein. The FDA also approved Sunitinib malate in 2006 for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer where its effectiveness is probably due to its ability to block a different set of proteins. Sunitinib malate has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.    ",NCT00631618

Melanoma,Phase I/II Study of ADI-SS PEG 20000mw in Patients With Advanced Metastatic Melanoma, The purpose of this study is to test a new drug called ADI-SS PEG 20000 mw in patients with melanoma. The study drug (ADI-SS PEG 20000 mw) is being used because it causes a nutrient called arginine to break down. Arginine is an amino acid. Amino acids are the building blocks that our bodies use to make proteins. Normal cells do not require arginine. Melanoma cells however seem to need arginine to survive. ADI-SS PEG 20000 mw will be used as a way to starve melanoma cells and stop them from growing.    ,NCT00520299
Melanoma,A Phase I/II Open-Label Study of Ipilimumab and GM-CSF Administered to Unresectable Stage IIIC and Stage IV Melanoma Patients, The purpose of this study is to test the combination of Ipilimumab and GM-CSF.

Melanoma,A Phase I/II Study of Dasatinib and Dacarbazine, The purpose of this study is to: Phase I Objectives:   -  Find the most tolerated dose to use for Phase II   -  Collect information on how the body responds to this combination of study drug Phase II Objectives:   -  To determine the overall response of participants using this combination of study drug The expression of proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (Src) a substance present in a significant proportion of melanomas plays a role in the growth multiplying and dividing of cancer cells. Melanoma cells appear to be sensitive to these agents that block the action of Src in concentrations that can be achieved in patients. We suggest that Src inhibitors (such as Dasatinib) may be a good choice for treatment of melanoma in combination with Dacarbazine (a chemotherapy drug that can cause the shrinkage of melanomas). We wish to to evaluate the Src inhibitor Dasatinib in combination with the chemotherapy drug Dacarbazine. The novel oral Src inhibitor Dasatinib may be able to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy for melanoma compared to chemotherapy alone. Dacarbazine is a standard treatment for melanoma currently. The effectiveness of this chemotherapy drug may be increased by combination with Dasatinib. Dacarbazine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating melanoma; Dasatinib has been approved by the FDA to treat leukemia but it has not been approved alone or in combination with Dacarbazine to treat melanoma.    ,NCT00597038

Melanoma,Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation and Bevacizumab or Ipilimumab as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery, This randomized phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and bevacizumab or ipilimumab works as first-line therapy in treating patients with stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by binding to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and by preventing the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Ipilimumab blocks a substance called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) on the surface of T cells and may help the immune system kill cancer cells. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and bevacizumab is more effective than ipilimumab in treating melanoma.    ,NCT02158520

Melanoma,Evaluation of Photosensitivity in Dabrafenib or Vemurafenib Treated Metastatic Melanoma Patients - a Phase IIa/IIb Study, The BRAF inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib belong both two a new class of potent anti-cancer drugs and are highly efficacious in tumors harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. Both drugs seem to be equally efficacious; however their toxicity profile seems to differ. Serious phototoxicity has been observed in ~ 30% of patients treated with vemurafenib and in ~2 percent of patients treated with dabrafenib. These phototoxic reactions have developed in spite of informing the patients of this possible adverse event and instructing them to protect themselves. Manifestation of phototoxic reactions depends on the patient's habits of exposure and their efforts to protect themselves. The true frequency of photosensitivity can only be established by systematic photo-testing. In dermatology standard test procedures with different UV-wavelengths and dosages have been established and the primary goal of this study will be to clarify the true rate of photosensitivity by these two BRAF-inhibitors. Furthermore systematic experience will be collected how to best protect patients from phototoxic events. Dabrafenib and Vemurafenib are commercially available and considered standard of care for BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma in Germany. As the number of patients will not allow any conclusion with regard to efficacy or safety of vemurafenib patients randomized to vemurafenib in part 2 will only remain on study until completion of phototesting.    ,NCT02052193
Melanoma,Pilot Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Metformin in Melanoma, In western countries melanoma represents a major mistake of public health by its frequency lethality and the increasing of incidence. Surgery can cure melanoma diagnosed very early. In other cases it exists a risk of recurrence of lymph node and visceral. At the stage of visceral metastases the prognosis of melanoma is catastrophic with a median survival of 6 months. Indeed the reference chemotherapy by dacarbazine induces a very limited response rate of 10-20% the ipilimumab which has been authorized in the second intention has a response rate of 10% and other available treatments don't have a superior efficiency. Metformin is an oral antidiabetic of biguanides family which acts by inducing the activation of AMPK a molecule which is inactivated in many cancers including the melanoma. In agreement with these data several preclinical studies suggested that metformin has antineoplastic activity. In the case of melanoma a study published recently has showed that metformin inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro and we confirmed for our part these results in our laboratory (INSERM U895).    ,NCT01840007
Melanoma,A Phase I Exploratory Intra-patient Dose Escalation Study to Investigate the Preliminary Safety Pharmacokinetics and Anti-tumor Activity of Pasireotide (SOM230) s.c.Followed by Pasireotide LAR in Patients With Metastaticmelanoma or Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma, This study will evaluate the preliminary safety pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of pasireotide s.c. in patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. The study consists of three phases: screening intra-patient dose-escalation and follow-up phases. In the screening phase patient will be informed of all aspects of the study and sign informed consent forms and then be screened for study eligibility. During the intra-patient dose escalation phase 18 patients will be treated with pasireotide s.c. 300 μg t.i.d. for 2 weeks. If there are no unacceptable AEs defined as drug-related clinically meaningful uncontrolled grade 3 or any grade 4 toxicities patients will be dose escalated to 600 μg t.i.d. for 2 more weeks then 900 μg t.i.d. for 2 weeks and then 1200 μg for 2 weeks provided that there are no unacceptable AEs. Each patient will be in the dose escalation phase for a maximum of 8 weeks. At end of the intra-patient dose escalation phase patients will be allowed to switch to 80 mg pasireotide LAR i.m. q 28 d (or a lower dose in case of toxicity) for an additional 6 months or until disease progression or unacceptable AEs or patient withdraws consent. In addition all patients will keep their pasireotide s.c. t.i.d. treatment (same dose as that at the end of the 8-week dose escalation phase) during the first 2 weeks of the LAR follow-up phase except on the day receiving the first LAR dose because of an anticipated initial burst of drug release.    ,NCT01652547

Melanoma,Evaluation of Groin Lymphadenectomy Extent For Metastatic Melanoma, BACKGROUND: Spread of metastatic melanoma to the groin lymph nodes (LN) is a common event affecting about 350 people a year in Australia. Globally it has been shown that patients with involved groin LN without proven pelvic LN disease on imaging receive 1 of 3 management strategies in equal proportions - inguinal lymphadenectomy (IL); ilio-inguinal lymphadenectomy (I-IL); or variable use of either depending on circumstances. Different experts have strong and polarised opinions favouring either IL or more extensive I-IL with existing cases series reporting conflicting data on best cancer outcomes. No high level evidence proves which operation is best. HYPOTHESIS: There will be no significant difference in DFS between patients having IL or I-IL conditional on PET/CT scan showing no evidence of pelvic disease at the time of diagnosis of groin LN metastatic melanoma. AIMS: To provide a rational evidence base for management for melanoma to the groin LNs by randomly assessing the effect of each operation on DFS distant DFS overall survival (OS) morbidity - including early complications and longer-term rates of lymphedema as well as comprehensively assessed QOL. Also to clarify the reliability of PET/CT scans for staging pelvic LNs and evaluate any health economic benefits of I-IL over IL. TARGET POPULATION: To recruit 634 patients in 5 years. DESIGN: An Australian led international multi-centre non-inferiority phase III prospective randomised clinical trial comparing IL or I-IL for patients with metastatic melanoma to groin LNs and no evidence of pelvic disease on PET/CT. ENDPOINTS: DFS Distant DFS OS and QOL at 5 years. Accuracy of PET/CT for pelvic LN metastases. OUTCOMES: International standardization of care improved cancer outcomes improved QOL for patients with groin metastatic melanoma. Proof of principle about extent of surgery when PET/CT is clear in adjacent LN areas leading to clinical trials investigating management of other lymph node fields.    ,NCT02166788
Melanoma,Study of Nilotinib in Metastatic Melanoma With KIT Aberrations, Major response was observed to imatinib mesylate in KIT-mutated metastatic rectal melanoma (Hodi FS et al J Clin Oncol 26:2046-2051 2008). In the ASCO annual meeting in 2009ar KIT mutations were reported to be present in 23% of acral and 15.2% of mucosal melanomas (Heinrich MC et al J Clin Oncol 26:2008 abstr 9016). Nilotinib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting KIT PDGFR and Bcr-Abl and inhibiting the proliferating of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant cells in vitro. Phase I study of nilotinib alone and in combination with imatinib in patients with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) demonstrated significant activity (72% stable disease for nilotinib alone and 56% for nilotinib/imatinib combination) (Blay JY et al J Clin Oncol 26:2008 abstr 10553). Thus we propose to conduct a phase II study of nilotinib in metastatic melanoma with KIT mutations.    ,NCT01099514
Melanoma,High-Dose Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2B Ipilimumab or Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Stage III-IV High Risk Melanoma That Has Been Removed by Surgery, This randomized phase III trial studies how well high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B or ipilimumab works compared with pembrolizumab in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that has been removed by surgery but is likely to come back or spread. High-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B may help shrink or slow the growth of melanoma. Monoclonal antibodies such as ipilimumab and pembrolizumab may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. It is not yet known whether high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B or ipilimumab is more effective than pembrolizumab in treating patients with melanoma.    ,NCT02506153
Melanoma,Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Metastatic Ocular Melanoma, Background: - The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors growing them in the laboratory in large numbers and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. This study will use chemotherapy to prepare the immune system before this white blood cell treatment. After receiving the cells the drug aldesleukin (IL-2) may be given to help the cells stay alive longer.

Melanoma,Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes And Low-Dose Interleukin-2 Therapy Following Cyclophosphamide And Fludarabine In Patients With Melanoma, This is a phase II clinical study for patients with metastatic (the cancer has spread to other parts of the body) melanoma. Patients will receive an infusion (given by vein) of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). TILs are a type of white blood cells that recognizes tumor cells and enter them which causes the tumor cells to break down. Prior to the cell infusion patients will receive a two drugs cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to prepare the body to receive the TILs. After cell infusion patients will receive low-dose interleukin-2 therapy which is an approved drug to treat melanoma. This study will see how useful this regimen is in treating metastatic melanoma.    ,NCT01883323
Melanoma,A Phase II Study of Sunitinib Versus Dacarbazine in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Uveal Melanoma, Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma with radiotherapy or surgery. But if this cancer spreads it is more difficult to treat. Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma that has spread with a chemotherapy called dacarbazine but they are always looking to find new ways to treat uveal melanoma. This study aims to find out how well Sunitinib works to treat uveal melanoma and to see how long Sunitinib and Dacarbazine can help to prevent the cancer from getting worse.    ,NCT01551459

Pembrolizumab is an antibody that helps the immune system to attack cancer cells. Although pembrolizumab has proven clinical efficacy in treating patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma an effect on metastatic uveal melanoma has not been established. Entinostat is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that has effects on both cancer cells and immune regulatory cells thus potentially enhancing the effects of immunotherapy.    ,NCT02697630
Melanoma,Nilotinib in TKI Resistant or Intolerant Patients With Metastatic Mucosal Acral or Chronically Sun Damaged Melanoma, Given the poor prognosis and limited treatment options available for patients with mucosal or acral/lentiginous melanomas who develop metastatic disease genetic discoveries of KIT mutations in these cancers present the need to test multi-targeted kinase inhibitors with potent KIT inhibitory activity in this patient population. Imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have the potential to be effective in this patient population but patients may develop resistance to treatment. Therefore in this study we propose to test nilotinib in patients with metastatic mucosal acral or chronically sun-damaged melanoma following treatment with another TKI.    ,NCT00788775
Melanoma,A Trial Looking at Nilotinib to Treat Acral and Mucosal Melanoma Skin Cancer That Has Spread, The aim of this study is to see if a drug called nilotinib (Tasigna®) is effective in the treatment of patients with a rare group of acral and mucosal melanomas that have a change (mutation) in a protein called cKIT. Nilotinib interferes with signalling inside cells with this mutation and it is believed that this may lead to shrinkage of tumours. Acral melanomas are found on the palms and soles and mucosal melanomas start inside body cavities rather than on the skin.    ,NCT01395121
Melanoma,SU011248 in Patients With Metastatic Mucosal or Acral/Lentiginous Melanoma, The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective Sunitinib works in treating acral lentiginous and mucosal melanoma which has spread beyond the local region.

Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving carboplatin and paclitaxel together with sorafenib tosylate is more effective than carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating melanoma.    ,NCT00110019
Melanoma,SRS (Stereotactic Radiosurgery) Plus Ipilimumab," This research is being done to look at the safety of using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and Ipilimumab together to treat melanoma that has spread to the brain or spine. Both Ipilimumab and SRS are used alone for the treatment of melanoma that has spread. Standard of care uses both of these treatments but not together. By using them together we expect better treatment of melanoma but there might be an increase in side effects. ""Ipilimumab"" is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of melanoma that has spread throughout the body. It works by activating your immune system to fight off cancer. ""Stereotactic radiosurgery"" (SRS) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of melanoma in the brain or spine. It uses radiation to treat tumors without needing to cut or use stitches. The use of combining SRS and Ipilimumab in this research study is investigational. The word ""investigational"" means that this combination is not approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration but is allowed for use in this research study.    ",NCT01950195
Melanoma,PET Imaging of Patients With Melanoma and Malignant Brain Tumors Using an 124I-labeled cRGDY Silica Nanomolecular Particle Tracer: A Microdosing Study, Current tests to detect cancer including CAT scans and MRI scans are limited. PET scans use special dyes that are injected into a vein and can better localize possible cancer. The investigators have developed a new particle that can carry a radioactive dye to a very specific area of the tumor. When using a PET scan the radioactive dye can be viewed in areas of possible disease. This particle has been studied in mice and was safe. The particles will not treat the cancer and any images or information found during this study will not be used for your treatment. The information collected may be used to guide the design of future studies to detect and/or treat tumors.    ,NCT01266096

Melanoma,EktoTherix??Regenerative Tissue Scaffold for Repair of Surgical Excision Wounds," The purpose of study is to assess the safety and performance of EktoTherix??Tissue Repair Scaffold in the treatment of full-thickness dermatologic wounds created by the surgical removal of non-melanoma skin cancers. EktoTherix??is a medical device developed by Neotherix Limited manufactured by the polymer processing technique of electrospinning. Described as a ""tissue scaffold"" EktoTherix is placed into the surgical wound to help the patients' own cells repair the wound enhancing healing and improving quality (including cosmetic outcome). The tissue scaffold is completely absorbed by the body during the healing process which means that there is no need to remove it when the wound is healed. All patients recruited into this study are treated with EktoTherix are seen weekly until they heal and seen again at the final follow-up visit three months post-surgery. The investigators hypothesise that the use of EktoTherix will increase incidence of complete healing and result in an overall better cosmetic result of the healed wound.    ",NCT02409628
Melanoma,Same-day Versus Separate-day Preoperative Consultation for Mohs Surgery, The purpose of this study is to determine whether separate- versus same-day preoperative consultation affects time to treatment (start to finish) utilization rate of Mohs rate of case cancellations cost and patient satisfaction. The investigators hypothesize that patients with same-day preoperative consultation will have a shorter time between cancer diagnosis and removal but only when coordination of care is needed longer time between removal and consultation with other specialists as compared to patients with separate-day consultation. The investigators anticipate that patients with same-day preoperative consultation will have a decrease in travel cost as compared to patients with separate-day consultation. The investigators expect that there will be no difference in various satisfaction matters between groups with the exception of potentially greater convenience reported by patients in the same-day preoperative consultation group. Finally the investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference between groups in regards to rates of surgery cancellation.    ,NCT02321982

Melanoma,THE IPI - Trial in Advanced Melanoma: Melanoma Patients With Advanced Disease," This is an open-label multi-center single-arm clinical phase II study to further characterize the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab in patients with or without systemic pretreatment metastatic ocular melanoma. The DeCOG-MM-PAL11-Trial will be continued only for patients with ocular melanoma because sufficient numbers of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma patients have already been recruited. In order to allow the separate subgroup analysis as planned in the protocol for ocular melanoma it is mandatory to focus the recruitment to this patient population. Only this will guarantee a valid evaluation of all cohorts. Ocular melanoma is defined as melanomas originated from uvea the choroid the ciliary body and conjunctiva. (see McCartney ACE ""Pathology of ocular melanomas"" British Medical Bulltta 1995 Vol 51 No 3 pp 678-693) The same criteria and treatment procedure as those used before will be applied for the patients with advanced ocular melanoma. Since no treatment standard in those patients does exist also patients without prior systemic treatment can be included in this study. Therefore the 5th inclusion criterion has been adapted in order to enrol the eligible patients.    ",NCT01355120
Melanoma,The Role of Inflammation in Ocular Tumours, This prospective non-therapeutic study will determine whether a novel imaging technique can identify presumptive tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) in patients with ocular tumours. In this study we will modify the standard angiography protocol by having patients return twice in the week following angiography for additional photographs. Photographs will be obtained 2-7 days after angiography but without further injection of dye. This technique contrasts with normal angiography in which photographs are taken during the transit phase of dye circulation and in the minutes thereafter. Of note both the dye and the cameras used for its detection have been approved for clinical use for several decades and are routinely used in the evaluation of patients with ocular tumours. We will evaluate 5 groups:   1. Choroidal nevus (low-risk features): requires distinction from melanoma through diagnostic testing   2. Choroidal indeterminate melanocytic lesion (high-risk features): requires diagnostic testing for identification and distinction from nevus and melanoma   3. Choroidal melanoma: requires confirmation of diagnosis and evaluation for potential metatstases   4. Suspected metastatic tumour (ie primary tumour elsewhere): requires identification of primary tumour   5. Locally treated ocular tumours: requires followup to evaluate response to treatment and potential change or repeat therapy    ,NCT02909517

The activated T cells are then injected back into the same participant using an i.v. to help the participant's immune system to target melanoma. The participant will undergo regular blood testing to determine whether the X-ACT treatment has resulted in changes to the immune system and also whether the T cells which were given back to the patient persist in the blood stream over time. In addition the effect of the X-ACT treatment on the growth or shrinkage of the participant's melanoma will be measured.    ,NCT02327390
Melanoma,Disulfiram in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Melanoma remains a malignancy that is largely resistant to chemotherapy. Metastatic disease responds poorly to the treatments used today with only 2 out of 30 drugs tested DTIC and nitrosoureas showing response rates greater than 10% and complete responses are rare. DTIC-based regimen has been recognized as a standard chemotherapy for advanced melanoma and temozolomide demonstrated efficacy equal to that of DTIC and is an oral alternative agent that also crosses the blood brain barrier. Randomized phase III trials have shown no survival benefit of adding other agents (cisplatin BCNU and tamoxifen). Biochemotherapy is being developed extensively with moderate improvement in the responsive rate (approximately 50%) and is under evaluation in randomized trial to identify whether there is survival benefit to this strategy compared with chemotherapy alone. Recently a randomized phase III study comparing chemotherapy (cisplatin dacarbazine and tamoxifen) with biochemotherapy (the same chemotherapy regimen plus high-dose IL-2 and interferon alfa) have shown 44% response rate for biochemotherapy vs. 27% for chemotherapy. However the tendency toward an increased response rate in patients who received biochemotherapy did not translate into an increase in overall survival and there was in fact a trend for a survival advantage in patients receiving chemotherapy alone (median survival: 10.7 vs 15.8 months). New agents (or combinations) need to be developed for this refractory malignancy. The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate and evaluate the toxicity of disulfiram (DSF) in the treatment of Stage IV melanoma. The advantages of using DSF in this phase I/II trial are the following:   -  DSF has been used as a drug for many years for the treatment of alcoholism. Its mechanism pharmacokinetics toxicity/tolerable dose are well known and this drug is relatively non-toxic by itself at therapeutic dose. Doses of greater than 3000mg/m2 can cause reversible confusion.   -  DSF can be taken orally; therefore it is convenient to administer.   -  DSF can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (unlike dacarbazine and many other chemotherapy agents); therefore it might have an active effect on CNS metastasis. This study is designed to include women and minorities but is not designed to measure differences of intervention effect.    ,NCT00256230

The 2 receptors CVA21 uses to infect a cell are Intracellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and Decay Accelerating Factor. Both of these surface proteins are expressed on melanoma cell lines as well as human melanoma tumours. Animal models of human melanoma tumours have demonstrated that CVA21 injection either intratumour or intravenous causes infection in the tumours resulting in reduction of tumour size and growth.    ,NCT00438009
Melanoma,Autologous Dendritic Cell-Tumor Cell Immunotherapy for Metastatic Melanoma," The purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell therapy. This research study is evaluating if a patient-specific experimental therapy for metastatic melanoma will lengthen survival with minimal harmful effects. It is called an experimental therapy (or ""study therapy"") because it is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This research study will use the patient's own tumor cellsthe patient's own dendritic cells (a type of immune cell) and a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF a type of growth factor). GM-CSF is a natural growth factor that stimulates growth of white blood cells in the body. Since 1991 GM-CSF has been used as a standard treatment to help increase the number of white blood cells after chemotherapy. The patient's dendritic cells are grown in a test-tube with the patient's tumor cells and the growth factor. The resulting solution is called the study therapy. The intent of the study therapy is to make the dendritic cells more effective at fighting the tumor when they are injected back into the patient.    ",NCT01875653

Melanoma,Efficacy of Propranolol Treatment to Prevent Melanoma Progression, Melanoma's incidence is increasing worldwide. The efforts made in melanoma screening led to an earlier detection of the primary tumour and a better prognosis but melanoma remains an aggressive cancer when it comes to its metastatic stage. Three recent retrospective studies compared groups of patients diagnosed with primary melanoma and treated with betablockers for another indication to patients who never received betablockers. In these three studies the outcome of the disease is significantly better for people under betablocker treatment with a decreased rate of recurrence and a better 5 years survival rate. Here we want to investigate the efficacy and the tolerability of an adjuvant treatment with propranolol for patients suffering from a primary melanoma with a high risk of recurrence.    ,NCT01988831

Melanoma,Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Transfected Dendritic Cell Vaccination in High Risk Uveal Melanoma Patients, 1. Rationale Immunotherapy applying ex vivo generated and tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DC) has now successfully been introduced in the clinic. A limited but consistent number of objective immunological and clinical responses have been observed. Most of the successful results have been observed in patients with minimal residual disease rather than patients with advanced metastatic disease. Moreover the investigators' preliminary results show that presence of tumor epitope specific T cells in biopsies taken from delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction sites highly correlates with prolonged progression free survival (PFS). Within uveal melanoma patients a group with high risk of metastatic disease can be identified on basis of tumor specific genetic changes in loss of chromosome 3. At present no standard adjuvant or systemic treatment is available. Applying DC-based immunotherapy in this group of high risk patients might reduce the risk of recurrence without interference in the current treatment guidelines.   2. Objectives In this joint clinical study of Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RUNMC) and Rotterdam Eye Hospital the investigators aim to determine the in vivo immunological response induced in high risk uveal melanoma patients vaccinated with mRNA-transfected DC.   3. Study design This study is an open label non-randomized phase II intervention study.   4. Study population The investigators' study population consists of HLA-A2 positive patients with a high risk uveal melanoma with proven expression of melanoma associated antigens tyrosinase and/or gp100.   5. Main study endpoints This is an exploratory study aiming to demonstrate proof of principle. The first study endpoints are in vivo immunological response induced in high risk uveal melanoma patients vaccinated with mRNA-transfected DC administered i.v./i.d. and toxicity. Secondary study endpoints are progression free survival overall survival and toxicity.    ,NCT00929019

Plaque radiotherapy has emerged as the most common eye-preserving treatment in the current management of uveal melanoma but is complicated by visual loss in approximately 70% of patients at 10 years follow-up. Strategies for the prevention and early treatment of radiation retinopathy/maculopathy need to be developed to improve visual outcomes following plaque treatment. Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is the antigen binding fragment of a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody which inhibits the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor A a mediator in the development of choroidal neovascularization. Lucentis is commonly used in the eye for eye conditions such as age related macular degeneration. This study will investigate the possible benefit of Anti-VEGF therapy (Lucentis) in reducing the incidence of radiation complications following plaque radiation for uveal melanoma.    ,NCT00540930
Melanoma,A Study of Sorafenib in Patients With Chemonaive Metastatic Uveal Melanoma, Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intra-ocular malignancy in adults with an incidence of 0.6 - 0.7 per 100000 per year. Prognosis of metastatic uveal melanoma is poor. In retrospective analyses a median survival time after detection of metastases of 5 months (Flaherty et al 1998) and 7 months (Kath et al 1993) was reported. For patients receiving no treatment reported median survival was 2.0 months compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (Gragoudas et al 1991). Up to now there is no established treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma. Some therapeutic approaches with locoregional treatment or systemic chemotherapy have been undertaken: In case of metastatic disease which is confined to the liver in about 85% of patients with uveal melanoma surgical resection led to a median survival of 14 months (Mariani et al 2009) or 19 months and a 5-year survival rate of 22% in a selected patient population (Adam et al 2006). As locoregional treatment option treatment with fotemustine via direct intra-arterial hepatic infusion was investigated and led to a median survival of 15 months (Peters et al 2006). This was not a randomized trial but a report on 101 consecutive treated patients. Additional debulking surgery was performed whenever feasible. A randomized phase III trial comparing intra-arterial hepatic fotemustine administration with intravenous systemic fotemustine and overall survival as primary endpoint is still ongoing (EORTC 18021). Thus no systemic chemotherapy is approved for metastatic uveal melanoma. Although no specific genes have been linked to the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma preclinical studies suggest potential benefit of inhibitors of Bcl-2 ubiquitin-proteasome histone deactylase mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-AKT pathways and receptor tyrosine kinases. Thus sorafenib as inhibitor of b-Raf and Raf-1 (c-Raf or c-Raf-1) pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) may potentially lead to a benefit for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in terms of disease control and prolongation of survival.    ,NCT01377025
Melanoma,Assessing the Clinical Effectiveness of Serum Biomarkers in the Diagnosis of Metastatic Uveal Melanoma, Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adults. The local treatment is effective but patients still die of metastatic disease. It has been shown that early diagnosis of a few isolated metastases can result in a clean surgical excision of the metastases and an extension of the expected survival from 7-12 months to over 10 years on some patients. Many serum biomarkers are employed in Oncology. It makes sense to try the relevant ones in the diagnosis of metastatic uveal melanoma. The investigators hypothesis is that a soluble serum biomarker level changes upon development of metastatic disease either by secretion by the tumor cells themselves or by their environment. Detection of changes in biomarker level may lead to the diagnosis of metastases before they can be detected by imaging modalities thus allowing for early treatment of the metastases and a better chance of success.    ,NCT01438658

Metastatic Cancer,Vemurafenib and White Blood Cell Therapy for Advanced Melanoma, Background: - One possible treatment for advanced melanoma involves collecting white blood cells from the person with cancer and growing them in a laboratory. The cells can then be given back to the donor. This study will use this white blood cell treatment with the cancer treatment drug vemurafenib. Vemurafenib targets melanoma cells that have a mutation in the B-raf gene and may be able to make them shrink. Objectives: - To see if vemurafenib and white blood cell therapy is a safe and effective treatment for advanced melanoma. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years and less than or equal to 66 years of age who have advanced melanoma that contains the B-raf genetic mutation. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.   -  White blood cells will be collected from tumor cells. These cells will be collected during surgery or a tumor biopsy.   -  Participants will have leukapheresis to collect additional white blood cells for the procedure.   -  Participants will take vemurafenib twice a day starting 3 weeks before receiving the white blood cells.   -  Participants will have 1 week of chemotherapy to prepare their immune system to accept the white blood cells.   -  Participants will receive an infusion of their collected white blood cells. They will also receive aldesleukin for up to 5 days to boost the immune system s response to the white blood cells. They will remain in the hospital until they have recovered from the treatment.   -  Participants will have frequent follow-up visits to monitor the outcome of the treatment.    ,NCT01585415

Solid Tumours,Study of Dabrafenib +/- Trametinib in Combination With Ipilimumab for V600E/K Mutation Positive Metastatic or Unresectable Melanoma, This is an open-label multi-center dose-finding Phase 1 study that will enroll subjects at least 18 years old with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and BRAF V600 mutations. The primary objective of the study is to describe the safety for the doublet therapy (dabrafenib and ipilimumab) and the triplet therapy (dabrafenib/trametinib and ipilimumab). Preliminary efficacy data will also be collected. Subjects will be assigned to receive either the doublet combination (dabrafenib and ipilimumab) or the triplet combination (dabrafenib trametinib and ipilimumab). Subjects will be enrolled to dose-finding cohorts in the doublet combination (dabrafenib + ipilimumab) in a sequential 3+3 fashion. Following establishment of a dose for the doublet combination an expansion cohort will be opened. At the same time enrollment to dose finding cohorts for the triplet combination (dabrafenib + trametinib + ipilimumab) will begin in a sequential 6+6 fashion. Enrollment into triplet cohorts will take priority when both the doublet expansion arm and the triplet dose-finding arm are open for enrollment at the same time. Approximately 9-24 subjects will be enrolled to the dose finding portion of the study. Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled to doublet expansion cohort and 30 subjects will be enrolled in the triplet expansion cohort. A two-week run-in period without ipilimumab will be followed by 4 intravenous doses of ipilimumab at the recommended dose and schedule. Oral daily dosing of dabrafenib or dabrafenib + trametinib will continue from the two-week run-in through combination with ipilimumab and post-ipilimumab until no longer of clinical benefit in the opinion of the treating physician or until unacceptable AE or death    ,NCT01767454
