HIV,Correlation Between Cytokines and Hepatic Histology in Patients Infected by HIV-1 and the Hepatitis-C Virus, This study aims at correlating TNF-α INF-γ IL-2 IL-4 IL-10 and TGF-β values as dosed by ELISA and mRNA expression by real-time PCR with histopathological hepatic biopsy findings in individuals with HIV/HCV coinfection. This population will be divided into three groups (G1: with no HAART; G2: with detected HIV viral load (HIV VL); G3: with undetected HIV VL) which will be then compared to two control groups with monoinfection by HIV or by HCV in addition to a third control group comprising normal blood donors.    ,NCT00499434
HIV,Immune Reconstitution of Lopinavir/Ritonavir-Based vs Efavirenz-based HAART in Advanced HIV Disease, The ideal anti-HIV medications for patients with advanced HIV disease is unknown. There is evidence that anti-HIV regimens that contain protease inhibitors can enhance immune function better than regimens that do not contain protease inhibitors. This is a study that will determine the difference in immune enhancement capabilities between an anti-HIV regimen that contains the protease inhibitor - lopinavir-ritonavir and a regimen that contains efavirenz. Both medications are recommended as first line treatments for HIV-infected patients. This study will recruit HIV-positive patients that need to start anti-HIV treatment because their CD4+ T-cells are below 200. The usual threshold for starting treatment is a CD4+ T-cell less than 350. Subjects will be randomized to treatment with either an anti-HIV regimen that contains lopinavir-ritonavir or a regimen that contains efavirenz. The study will determine the difference in immune reconstitution over 24 weeks of treatment with study medications. Among the immune parameters that will be measured is the ability of each subject to respond to vaccination with the tetanus-diphtheria vaccine and the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Both vaccines are also recommended for HIV-positive patients but HIV-positive patients tend to have a lower response rate to these vaccines.    ,NCT00775606

HIV,Brief Intervention for Rural Women at High Risk for HIV/HCV, The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by providing knowledge about the health risk behaviors and service utilization of a vulnerable and understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in a rural Appalachian setting. Successful completion of the aims of this project will advance the delivery of a low-cost potentially high impact intervention with implications for a number of other real world settings (such as criminal justice venues) where other disadvantaged high-risk drug users can be identified and targeted for intervention.    ,NCT01840722
HIV,Study of People With HIV Infection Who Have High Viral Loads Despite Combination Antiretroviral Therapy, Background: - The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs treat HIV infection. They generally decrease the amount of HIV virus in the blood (called viral load) to very low levels. This happens only if the drugs still fight HIV and if taken every day exactly as prescribed. When not taken as directed or if the ART drugs are not strong enough the virus can become resistant to them and the ART will not work to control the virus. Researchers want to know how to control HIV in people who can t lower their viral load with their current ART drugs. Objective: -<TAB>To better control HIV in people who can t get a lower viral load even with ART drugs and to learn more about why the HIV is not under control. Eligibility:   -  People at least 14 years old and with HIV.   -  People who have been on at least two combinations of ART drugs (including current ART).   -  People whose last two viral loads were greater than 1000 copies/mL. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with medical history physical exam and blood tests.   -  Participants will then have a baseline visit. They will have another physical exam blood tests plus answer questions about what they know about HIV and ART and how they take their ART.   -  Participants will arrange to stay in the NIH hospital for 7 8 days.   -  They will take their medications as usual. At the time to take the ART drugs they will have to ask a nurse to bring them. If they forget the nurse will bring them.   -  Participants will meet with a doctor pharmacist social worker and nurse to discuss ways to help participants remember to take their drugs.   -  Participants will have blood drawn about every other day.   -  Researchers will study the test results. Some participants will be put on different ART drugs. If that happens participants will have another NIH hospital stay for 7-8 days.   -  Participants will have 4 follow-up visits over 12 weeks then every 3 months for 2 years or more.    ,NCT01976715
HIV,Exploring Novel Mechanisms of Vaccine Failure LAIV Pilot Study, Influenza ('flu) can cause severe infections especially in people with weakened immune systems such as those with HIV. For this reason yearly vaccination is recommended with the standard 'inactivated' influenza vaccine to try and prevent infections in these populations. It is also recommended in all health care workers to help prevent the spread of influenza within healthcare settings. However having HIV infection may mean vaccines work less well in some people and the investigators do not completely understand why. An alternative to the standard 'inactivated' annual influenza vaccine is the 'live attenuated influenza vaccine' (LAIV) which means it consists of weakened versions of the influenza virus. Unlike the standard vaccine which is given by injection LAIV is a spray that is given into each nostril. It is now given to children in the UK in preference to the standard vaccine as it results in greater protection from influenza. In some other countries like the USA adults are also given LAIV where it seems to work just as well as the standard vaccine. A few studies in the past have shown that LAIV is safe and effective in HIVinfected children and adults. The investigators want to give LAIV to HIVinfected and HIV negative individuals to try to find out new information about how HIV infection may change the way in which people respond to vaccines. The investigators will do this by comparing both the early genetic response to the vaccines and later responses from cells specifically targeted to fight influenza ('Tcells') in these groups. In the long term the investigators hope that this will lead to designing new ways of improving the response to vaccines in HIVinfected people. As LAIV is given into each nostril rather than an injection the investigators also want to see if LAIV results in Tcells in the lung that are specifically targeted to fight influenza    ,NCT02266992
HIV,Immune Recovery in Advanced  ARV-naïve HIV-1-infected Individuals Taking Dolutegravir or Ritonavir-boosted Darunavir, There are few randomized clinical trials in advanced HIV patients. This is a multicenter randomized open clinical trial comparing 2 parallel groups to compare the immunological reconstitution and the virological efficacy and safety of 2 different combinations of antiretroviral therapy given once a day (QD): abacavir plus lamivudine plus either dolutegravir or darunavir-ritonavir during 96 weeks in advanced antiretroviral naïve HIV-1 infected patients with less than 100 CD4+ T-cells/mm3. Primary endpoint is the median increase in CD4+ T-cell count at 48 weeks after starting HAART.    ,NCT02337322
HIV,Thinking and Memory Problems in People With HIV, Background: - People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can sometimes develop thinking and memory problems. These problems can vary widely from few symptoms to severe problems with memory and concentration. It initially was thought that good HIV treatment could prevent almost all HIV-related memory problems. However even people with low HIV viral loads can have these problems. It may be caused by HIV affecting the brain and spinal fluid. It is not yet clear why HIV causes these problems and why they may be worse in some people than others. Researchers want to study people with HIV and healthy volunteers to see how HIV may affect people with only small amounts of the virus in their blood. Objectives: - To study thinking and memory problems in individuals with HIV that is otherwise controlled with medications. Eligibility:   -  Individuals between 18 and 61 years of age whose HIV has been controlled with medications for at least 1 year.   -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 61 years of age. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. A neurological test will also be given. Participants will have a baseline imaging study of the brain.   -  Within 12 weeks of the first visit participants will have a second visit. Additional blood samples will be drawn. Another brain imaging study will be performed.   -  Within 8 weeks of the second visit participants will have a third visit to collect more blood samples. They will also provide spinal fluid samples either as a single visit or a longer procedure.   -  After this visit participants will return every 6 months for up to 5 years. Blood samples will be collected as needed at these visits. Thinking and memory tests and imaging studies may also be given as needed. Spinal fluid may be collected at one visit a year.    ,NCT01875588

HIV,Viral Activation Transfusion Study (VATS), The purpose of the trial was to determine if transfusion of allogeneic blood to HIV-1 infected persons led to immune activation and consequent induction of HIV-1 or /or Cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication and whether this adversely affected clinical prognosis.    ,NCT00000593
HIV,Safety and Survival of Genetically Modified White Blood Cells in HIV-Infected Persons - A Study in Identical Twin Pairs, This study will evaluate the safety of giving lymphocytes (white blood cells) containing a new gene to HIV-infected individuals and will determine how long the cells survive in the bloodstream. Although the genetically altered cells will not directly benefit participants knowledge about the safety side effects and survival of these gene-marked cells in HIV-infected patients may lead to new treatment strategies. Identical twin pairs 18 years of age and older-one infected with HIV the other non-infected-may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood tests. All participants will have a tetanus booster shot. Non-infected twins will undergo a procedure called apheresis to collect white blood cells. For this procedure whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein similar to donating blood. The blood is separated it into its components by centrifugation (spinning) the white cells are removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the body either through the same needle or through another needle in the other arm. The harvested white cells will be grown in culture for approximately 10 days to 2 weeks to increase their numbers up to 1000-fold. A gene called NeoR which is derived from bacteria will be inserted into the cells and these gene-marked cells will be infused into the HIV-infected twin. HIV-infected twins will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for the first cell infusion. The gene-marked cells will be infused over a 60-minute period through a plastic tube (catheter) placed in an arm vein or if a suitable arm vein cannot be found through a special catheter placed into a large vein in the neck or chest. Vital signs (temperature pulse blood pressure and breathing rate) blood oxygen concentration and urine output will be monitored regularly for 24 hours. Blood samples will be collected before and after the infusion to monitor for gene-marked cells. Patients will be discharged the next day. They will return to NIH daily the first week (from Monday through Thursday) to monitor for CD4 cell counts plasma viral burden p24 antigen levels HIV levels and the presence of the NeoR gene and then weekly for the next 5 weeks for these tests and others to monitor blood and urine chemistry blood counts and immune function markers. If the NeoR gene cannot be detected after the first cell infusion the entire procedure (donor apheresis gene marking and infusion of cells) will be repeated twice-about once every 6 weeks. If the first infusion was uncomplicated the second and third infusions may be done on an outpatient basis with monitoring for 6 hours rather than 24. Six weeks after the third infusion tests will be scheduled monthly for 6 months and then yearly for long-term follow-up. In addition to the above procedures patients with a baseline CD4 lymphocyte count less than 100 cells per cubic millimeter of blood will be asked to undergo apheresis periodically to obtain the most accurate results for determining how long the NeoR gene persists in the blood. The procedure will be done weekly for the first 6 weeks after each infusion of cells then at week 8 and then every 4 weeks until the gene can no longer be detected in the lymphocytes. The schedule may change but will not require more frequent apheresis.    ,NCT00001353
HIV,Interleukin-2 Therapy for HIV Infection - Supplemental Procedures, Certain patients who are participating in NIH protocols involving interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy for HIV disease may be requested to have the following changes or additions to their study protocol:   -  3-day subcutaneous (sc) IL-2 administration: Patients currently receiving IL-2 intravenously (injections through a vein) may switch to subcutaneous administration (injections under the skin). Injections are given twice a day for 3 to 5 days (one treatment cycle) with cycles repeated no more often than every 8 weeks.   -  Home treatment of sc IL-2: Home administration of IL-2 injections involves less frequent data and safety monitoring and no medical evaluations at the Clinical Center except at the beginning of each cycle. Participants will receive IL-2 cycles on the same schedule they followed in their original protocol. They will be seen at the Clinical Center at regularly scheduled follow-up visits between cycles and for a medical evaluation and blood drawing before the start of each cycle to determine the safety of administering the next cycle. During the home cycle the patient's case manager or other team member will place monitoring telephone calls on days 2 and 4 of the cycle and again a week later. The timing and number of these calls may change depending on the findings of ongoing assessments of their usefulness. Patients will be required to notify the study team promptly of complications or other problems that develop with therapy.   -  Stored specimens and HLA testing: Stored blood and tissue samples from patients will be used for future research on HIV AIDS and related medical conditions and the immune system. The samples may be labeled with no identifying information with identifying information such as the patient's name or with a code that only the study team can link to the patient. Some of the blood drawn may be used for HLA typing a genetic test of markers of the immune system. Usually used to match bone marrow or organ transplants HLA type might also be used to try to identify factors associated with the progression of HIV disease or related conditions. Determining HLA type is also necessary to be able to perform certain research studies.   -  Tonsillar biopsy: Examination of tonsil tissue may provide information on the effects of IL-2 on the immune system and the expression of HIV. Patients in the randomized IL-2 study (93-CC-0113) may have tonsillar biopsies done up to three times-soon after enrollment after month 4 and after month 12. Patients in the open IL-2 study (91-CC-0143) would have procedures no more often than every 3 months with the following exception: patients in either study who are willing to have repeat biopsies performed during IL-2 therapy will have the procedure done up to three times during a round of IL-2: before Il-2 therapy day 2-3 or IL-2 therapy and day 4-6 of IL-2 therapy if the sequential biopsies can be safely performed. The area to be biopsied will be numbed with a local anesthetic and 1 to 2 small pieces of tissue will be biopsied.   -  Skin biopsy: Examination of skin tissue may help to explain how IL-2 causes changes in the skin. Biopsies will be obtained from areas of the skin that have been affected by IL-2 as well as from normal unaffected areas for comparison. Patients with Kaposi sarcoma will also have biopsies of normal skin to allow comparison with IL-2-induced changes in the Kaposi sarcoma lesions. The areas to be biopsied will be numbed with local anesthetic and a 2-mm (1/10th-inch) piece of skin will be biopsied from each site.    ,NCT00001354
HIV,Phase I Protocol for the Evaluation of the Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccination With Synthetic HIV Envelope Peptides in Patients With Early Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection, Synthetic HIV Peptide Vaccines (Treatment Protocol) We are conducting a study to evaluate the safety of two peptide vaccines (given alone or in combination) in patients with early HIV infection. Patients entered onto the study must have >500 CD4 cells/mm(3) and have preserved cardiac hepatic renal and bone marrow function. Patients must be off all anti-retroviral therapy for at least 6 months and may not have received any experimental HIV vaccines. The vaccines being testing in this trial are comprised of short peptide segments of the HIV envelope including the V3 loop. In animal studies the peptides were able to induce neutralizing antibodies as well as cytotoxic T responses to HIV. This will be the first trial in which they are given to humans. The study will last for approximately one year during which time the volunteers will receive 6 peptide vaccines under the skin. For more information please call Tino Merced-Galindez R.N. at (301) 496-8959 or Dr. Richard Little at (800) 772-5464.    ,NCT00001386
HIV,Genetically Modified Lymphocytes to Treat HIV-Infected Identical Twins - Study Modifications, Certain patients enrolled in NIH protocol 94-I-0206 at the Clinical Center may be eligible to participate in one or more of the following new options:   -  Donor/recipient extension phase - Both the recipient (HIV-infected twin) and donor (non-infected twin) will participate in this extension of the CD4-zeta gene therapy study. It will evaluate the safety and activity of infusing gene-modified CD4+ cells as well as the modified CD8+ cells.   -  Corticosteroid administration - A corticosteroid such as prednisone hydrocortisone or prednisolone will be added to the interleukin-2 (IL-2) regimen for preventing or treating side effects of IL-2 such as fever and other flu-like symptoms.   -  Extended follow-up - A more intensive follow-up will be scheduled for patients with substantial numbers of lymphocytes that harbor the CD4-zeta gene. Every 3 months participants will have blood tests and specialized tests of CD4 counts HIV-1 viral load and numbers of circulating cells containing the CD4-zeta gene every 3 months> the frequency of follow-up visits may be reduced as time goes by.   -  IL-2 continuation - Participants will continue to receive periodic treatment with IL-2 to see how long the genetically modified cells persist in the bloodstream and to evaluate the long-term response to IL-2.   -  Home treatment with interleukin-2 - Participants may receive future IL-2 treatment cycles at home. Home treatment involves less frequent data and safety monitoring and no medical evaluations at the Clinical Center except at the beginning of each cycle.    ,NCT00001409

HIV,Psychosocial Correlates and Coping Strategies Associated With Long-Term Survival of HIV-Infected Children, Children and adolescents with HIV/AIDS are living well beyond life expectancy that was projected for them in the recent past. Little is known about the psychosocial variables that coincide with long-term survival of HIV/AIDS. This longitudinal study examines the psychosocial factors and adaptive coping strategies associated with long-term survival of HIV/AIDS in children and how these factors change over a period of two years. In addition data is being collected from the primary caretakers on their own psychological well-being as will as their perceptions of their child's adjustment and coping. Participants include children who have been infected (either perinatally or through transfusion) for at least eight years and who were aware of their diagnosis.    ,NCT00001435
HIV,A Phase I /II Study of the Protease Inhibitor Indinavir (MK-0639) in Children With HIV Infection," This is a phase I/II study to determine the safety and tolerance of the protease inhibitor indinavir (MK-0639) alone and then in combination with HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy in children with HIV infection. Indinavir sulfate (the capsule formulation) has been shown to have potent antiviral activity and an acceptable safety profile in adults. HIV-infected children who have not received prior antiretroviral therapy and children who have become refractory to prior therapy or who have experienced toxicity to prior therapy will be included. In addition we will explore viral and CD4 cell kinetics before starting therapy and following exposure to antiretroviral agents. The study will be conducted in three parts.   1. In order to help interpret the antiviral activity of indinavir the virologic and immunologic profile of children will be studied within 2 weeks prior to starting the therapeutic part. For children who have never been treated this will be before the initiation of any antiretroviral therapy and for children who have already received antiretroviral therapy this will be done during the initial ""wash-out"" phase that is routinely interposed between two different treatment regimens.   2. The initial 16 weeks of therapy will then evaluate the toxicities pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of single drug therapy with indinavir.   3. Subsequently all children who are able to tolerate the combination of zidovudine and lamivudine (i.e. have no prior history of intolerance to one of these two agents) will be treated with these two reverse transcriptase inhibitors in addition to the protease inhibitor indinavir. Zidovudine and lamivudine will be added after 16 weeks at a fixed dosage. Toxicity pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of indinavir will also be investigated after combination therapy. All patients who wish to remain in this study after 96 weeks of therapy and who do not meet off study criteria will be permitted to receive extended treatment with their current indinavir combination therapy for an additional 48 weeks. The study will determine the pharmacokinetic profile of indinavir given as single drug or in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine. It will assess the preliminary antiviral and clinical activity by monitoring clinical status viral burden in plasma and markers of immunologic status. Based on safety and preliminary efficacy results from studies performed in adults we will study three dose levels which are expected to result in drug levels above the IC95 of HIV-1 for all or most of the dosing interval.

HIV,Home Treatment of HIV-Infected Patients With Interleukin-2 With or Without a Tumor Necrosis Factor Antagonist, Patients enrolled in NIH protocol 95-I-0133 at the Clinical Center may participate in an extension phase of this study in which the drug prednisone will be eliminated from the treatment regimen. Prednisone is associated with avascular necrosis a condition that has been found in a number of patients in this study. Also certain patients in this protocol may receive future interleukin-2 treatment cycles at home. Home administration of IL-2 injections involves less frequent data and safety monitoring and no medical evaluations at the Clinical Center except at the beginning of each cycle. To be eligible for home administration of IL-2 patients must:   -  Be enrolled in a current NIAID protocol for IL-2 therapy and have received at least 1 year of treatment on the protocol with at least two well-tolerated outpatient cycles at a stable dose.   -  Have a history of tolerable side effects while receiving IL-2 without frequent medical interventions intravenous fluid replacement or dose reductions.   -  Not have had any significant clinical or laboratory abnormalities during days 0 to 5 of the last two outpatient cycles.   -  Have a strong relationship with a private physician or health-care provider who has been involved in the patient's care and is willing to help supervise the patient's care during each home IL-2 cycle.   -  Live in a home with easy telephone access and have proved reliable in responding to telephone calls from clinic staff.   -  Give the clinic staff contact information for a close friend or relative who will agree to serve as a caregiver during each home cycle providing the patient non-medical assistance and checking on his or her condition daily.   -  Have reasonable access to emergency medical services and a nearby medical facility.   -  Have proved reliable and consistent in using sterile technique reconstituting IL-2 vials and administering subcutaneous IL-2 injections.   -  Be receiving outpatient IL-2 injections cycles at least once every 6 months as part of their normal protocol participation.   -  Have access to a home weight scale and be able to weigh themselves each day for safety monitoring. Participants will receive IL-2 cycles on the same schedule they followed in their original protocol participation. They will be seen at the Clinical Center at regularly scheduled follow-up visits between cycles and for a medical evaluation and blood drawing before the start of each cycle to determine the safety of administering the cycle. During the home cycle the patient's case manager or other team member will place monitoring telephone calls on days 2 and 4 of the cycle and again a week later. The timing and number of these calls may change depending on the findings of ongoing assessments of their usefulness. Patients will be required to notify the study team promptly of any complications or other problems that develop with therapy.    ,NCT00001475
HIV,Genetic Factors and Interrelationships for Cancer Risk-Related Behaviors and Complex Traits, We propose to conduct a multifactorial genetic study of cancer risk-related behaviors and other complex human characteristics. The main areas of interest are tobacco smoking excess alcohol consumption psychological traits and HIV/AIDS susceptibility and progression. The subjects will be adult male and female probands who display one or more of the phenotypes of interest together with their brothers sisters and parents. Information on tobacco and alcohol use psychological and personality traits sexual behavior HIV status and progression and other characteristics with possible genetic components will be obtained through structured interviews and questionnaires. DNA will be prepared from blood samples and typed for a series of candidate genes chosen for function and for random polymorphic markers. By correlating the genotypic and phenotypic information we hope to identify individual loci that interactively contribute to many different aspects of human health and disease.    ,NCT00001500
HIV,Thalidomide to Treat Oral Lesions in HIV-Infected Patients, This study will test the effectiveness of topical thalidomide in healing mouth sores in HIV infected patients. Oral (PO) thalidomide heals these sores at a dose of 200 mg per day. However PO thalidomide can cause drowsiness skin rashes allergic reactions increased viral load and even nerve damage that may not be reversible. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a topical formulation of thalidomide (placed directly on the surface of the sore) for the healing of these sores. Persons with HIV infection of acquired immunodeficiency of at least 18 years of age with one or more chronic painful intraoral lesions may be eligible for this study. Subjects must be referred by a primary care physician who is managing their care and must have HIV/AIDS status confirmed. Patients' HIV treatment regimen will not be altered and those receiving highly active therapy will not be excluded. Patients will be excluded if they are concurrently being treated for mucosal lesions (including topical or systemic steroids viscous lidocaine topical or systemic anti-fungals or mouthwashes) or concurrent thalidomide therapy; receving chemotherapy or radiation therapy for neoplasms; using concurrent acute therapy for opportunistic infections; concurrent use of sedatives (such as CNS depressants or alcohol use); history of allergy to thalidomide; pre-existing peripheral neuropathy of grade II or higher; pregnant or lactating females or those not practicing contraception according to FDA guidelines for thalidomide.    ,NCT00001524
HIV,Twins Study of Gene Therapy for HIV Infection," This study will test the safety and effectiveness of genetically altered T lymphocytes (white blood cells of the immune system) in reducing viral load in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The lymphocytes will have two genes inserted into them; a laboratory-manufactured anti-HIV gene designed to inhibit HIV reproduction (either the RevTD or Rev-TD-antiTAR gene) and a ""marker"" gene that will show whether or not the inserted genes have gotten into the cells. Identical twin pairs 18 years of age and older- one of whom is HIV-positive (infected with the human immunodeficiency virus) and the other HIV-negative (not infected) may be eligible for this study. All participants will have a complete medical history and physical examination blood tests and a tetanus booster shot if indicated. The non HIV-infected twin will then undergo lymphapheresis to collect lymphocytes. In this procedure whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The lymphocytes are then removed and the red cells and plasma are returned to the donor either through the same needle or through a second needle placed in the other arm. The donor cells are grown in the laboratory for a few days and then the new genes are inserted into them. The genetically altered cells are grown in the laboratory for several days until their numbers increase approximately a thousand-fold. They are then infused intravenously (through a vein) into the infected twin. These procedures-lymphapheresis gene modification and infusion-will be repeated at approximately 2-month intervals up to four times. Each lymphocyte infusion takes about 60 minutes. The patient's vital signs (temperature pulse blood pressure and breathing) are monitored frequently during the infusion and hourly for 4 hours after the infusion. Blood samples are taken the day of the infusion 3 days later and then weekly to monitor the gene-modified cells immune status viral activity and other factors. These tests may be done less often as the study progresses and more is learned about the safety of the infusions. The infusions are done on an outpatient basis unless side effects require that they be done in the hospital with post-infusion monitoring for at least 24 hours. Patients will be followed for long-term effects of treatment monthly for the first 3 months once a month for the next 9 months and yearly from then on. This study will contribute information about the use and side effects of gene therapy in HIV infection that may lead to new treatment strategies. A potential direct benefit to HIV-infected individuals participating in this study is reduced viral load; in laboratory studies the RevTD and Rev-TD-antiTAR genes have inhibited HIV spread in the test tube. However this is an early phase of study and the likelihood of receiving this benefit is unknown.    ",NCT00001535
HIV,Phase I Study of APL 400-003 a Candidate HIV Vaccine in HIV-Negative Volunteers, This is a randomized double blind study of the safety and immunogenicity of APL 400-003 a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the env and rev genes of HIV-1 in HIV-negative volunteers. Three doses of vaccine are being tested: 100 300 and 1000 micro g. 8 volunteers per dose will be randomized: 6 to plasmid vaccine and 2 to a vehicle control. Immunizations will be administered at day 0 and weeks 4 and 8 with a booster immunization administered at week 24. An additional 5 volunteers may be included in an open manner at the dose likely to be used in subsequent studies. The primary aims of the study are to determine: 1. the safety of APL 400-003 as evaluated by clinical and laboratory safety parameters and 2. the immunogenicity of APL 400-003 as determined by a broad range of laboratory assays. Up to 33 patients (allowing for drop-outs) will be enrolled in the study and volunteers will be followed for one year after immunization.    ,NCT00001538

HIV,Clinical Laboratory and Epidemiologic Pilot Studies of Individuals at High Risk for Viral-Associated Cancers, This protocol presents the rationale 25-year historical review and methods for multidisciplinary low-risk studies of individuals referred to the NCI Viral Epidemiology Branch (VEB). Referrals are generally for unusual types of cancer or related conditions known or suspected to be related to viruses. Kaposi's sarcoma in two homosexual men evaluated in 1981 is a classic example. These referral cases provide the basis for pilot studies that generate hypotheses the development of protocols for formal investigations of promising leads and help to set priorities for VEB. A VEB investigator who is a Staff Member at the NIH Clinical Center interviews each subject performs a physical examination draws a blood sample and when appropriate for the disease or virus under study obtains other clinically indicated biological specimens such as urine sputum saliva tears semen Pap smear or cervical anal oral or nasal swabs. On occasion other relatively non-invasive studies may be indicated. Skin testing with conventional licensed antigens for assessment of cellular immunity may be performed and skin lesions may be biopsied or excised. Tumor or other tissue biopsies may be obtained when biopsy or surgery is clinically indicated for other reasons. Otherwise no surgery is performed and no therapy is administered. Clinical referral to other components of NCI NIH or the private sector are made as needed. The biological specimens are frozen or otherwise preserved to be batch tested in current assays or future assays that will be developed. Such laboratory testing is performed either at VEB's own support laboratory or collaboratively in other NCI NIH or extramural laboratories that have the needed expertise for the disease or virus under study. Occasionally repeated or more long-term evaluation is required. More often a single evaluation in the NIH outpatient clinic or either at a collaborating physician's office or other suitable site in the field is sufficient. The VEB investigator provides counseling relevant to the virus or disease under study and about the interim study results. He or she makes appropriate referral if needed (e.g. to the Genetic Epidemiology Branch for genetic counseling). Clinically relevant results and the VEB investigator's interpretation of these results are provided in writing to the subject's primary caregiver. Confidentially of the information that is obtained is carefully protected. The results of the study are summarized for publication in the peer review literature.    ,NCT00001560
HIV,Immune Activity Against CVM Retinitis, This study will investigate whether medication for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis-a viral infection of the eye-can safely be stopped in HIV-infected patients whose immune function has improved from anti-HIV therapy. Medicines taken to fight CMV infection (ganciclovir foscarnet and cidofovir) can cause serious side effects such as low blood counts and kidney damage. Stopping these medications may therefore be beneficial. Patients with HIV infection who develop CVM retinitis usually have very low levels of infection-fighting white blood cells called CD4 cells-less than 50 cells per microliter of blood. New anti-HIV medications have been able to raise CD4 levels and improve immune function in many patients. This study will see if patients with CD4 levels above 150 cells per microliter can fight CVM retinitis without additional anti-CVM drugs. HIV-infected patients with CVM retinitis will have a physical examination and complete eye examination. These tests will be repeated after 2 weeks. If there is no evidence that the CMV infection has progressed and if it is in a location that is not immediately sight-threatening anti-CMV medications will be stopped. Patients will be examined every 2 weeks for 3 months and then every 3 weeks for the next 3 months. Patients whose CD4 count has remained above 100 after 6 months will continue to be followed every 4 weeks until the CVM infection becomes active again. At that time anti-CVM medicines will be re-started. Patients will also have blood and urine samples taken to test for levels of HIV and CMV in the blood and urine and will be interviewed about their vision and how it affects daily activities.    ,NCT00001611
HIV,Voriconazole vs. Amphotericin B in the Treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis, Invasive aspergillosis is a fungal disease which is increasing in incidence with the increase in immunocompromised persons in our population. Persons with prolonged neutropenia secondary to cytotoxic chemotherapies are at the highest risk for acute aspergillosis. Patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation receiving prolonged corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapies and persons with HIV infection and AIDS are also at risk. Even with antifungal therapy aspergillosis in its acute invasive forms has a high mortality. In bone marrow transplantation patients and in those whose infection involves the brain this mortality is greater than 90%. Amphotericin B in its conventional form is the current standard treatment for this disease. Response to therapy with amphotericin B usually ranges between 20-60% in most studies. The higher response rates are usually seen in those patients who can tolerate this agent for at least 14 days. Because of its nephrotoxicity and other adverse effects alternatives to conventional amphotericin B have been sought. These currently include liposomal forms of amphotericin B and itraconazole. Although these forms show a decrease in adverse effects the efficacy of these drugs has not been shown to be equivalent to conventional amphotericin B. Voriconazole is an investigational antifungal drug currently being brought to phase III trials in the US. This azole has been shown active against Aspergillus spp. in vitro and in animal models and early human trials to be effective against aspergillosis. It has been shown to be well-tolerated and is available in an intravenous and oral formulation. This study will evaluate the efficacy safety and toleration of voriconazole compared to conventional therapy with amphotericin B as primary treatment of acute invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. Patients will be randomized to open-labelled therapy with voriconazole or amphotericin B in a one-to-one ratio.    ,NCT00001646
HIV,White Blood Cell Infusions to Treat HIV Infection, This study will evaluate the safety and immune system effects of infusing HIV-infected patients with multiple doses of lymphocytes (white blood cells) from their non-infected identical twin. It will determine whether the donated lymphocytes can improve immune function and reduce viral load in the infected twin. Identical twin pairs-one who is infected with HIV-1 and one who is negative for the virus-may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with blood tests a medical history and physical examination. Both twin participants will receive a tetanus booster shot if needed. The non-infected twin will undergo apheresis to collect white blood cells. For this procedure whole blood is collected similar to the procedure for donating a unit of blood from a needle in the arm. The blood flows through a cell separator machine where the white cells are removed and the rest of the blood (red cells plasma and platelets) is returned to the donor through a catheter in the opposite arm. The collected lymphocytes will be given intravenously (through a vein) to the infected twin over a 60-minute period. This procedure-apheresis and infusions-will be repeated 4 days a week to complete one cycle. The cycles will be repeated about every 8 weeks for 6 cycles (about 1 year). The infected twin will have blood samples drawn on the first day of each cycle 2 weeks after the beginning of each cycle and 4 weeks after each cycle to evaluate immune status viral load and other safety parameters. The frequency of these blood tests may change as the study progresses. The infected twin will also undergo apheresis immediately before each cycle of infusions and one month later to test the white cells for certain immune features. The number of apheresis procedures may be reduced as the study proceeds.    ,NCT00001647
HIV,A Pilot Study of Adherence to Oral Medication and Health Beliefs of Adolescents With HIV and Their Mothers, The proposed study has two specific aims 1) to gather data about treatment adherence levels among adolescents (11-21 years) with HIV and 2) to obtain information about the adolescents and mothers' health beliefs and examine their relationship to the adolescents' adherence levels. This pilot study is designed to gather preliminary data about the feasibility of using several new measures with this population. To achieve these aims a convenience sample of approximately 45 adolescents with HIV will re recruited. The adolescents and their mothers will complete a brief questionnaire about their health beliefs. A 24-hour recall interview format will be used to assess the adolescents' treatment adherence to prescribed oral medication. The adolescent will complete recall interviews on three random days over a two week period. Data analysis will be primarily descriptive but will be used to generate more specific hypotheses for future research studies. The long-term goal of this research is to better identify adolescents with HIV at risk for non-adherence and design empirically derived interventions to improve their adherence levels. The health beliefs measure may also be useful in identifying irrational beliefs about the illness or treatment that can then be targeted for cognitive restructing in psychological interventions.    ,NCT00001699
HIV,Subcutaneously Administered Interleukin-12 Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients With Disseminated Mycobacterium Avium Complex Infection, Disseminated infection with Mycobacteria avium complex (MAC) is one of the most common systemic bacterial infections in advanced stages of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Current therapy for disseminated MAC infection in HIV patients consists of multidrug chemotherapy regimens are often accompanied by toxicities and many patients become intolerant of one or more agents. Macrolides are the essential component of successful therapy yet macrolide resistant strains are being recognized with increasing frequency. Thus there is an interest in identifying additional therapeutic interventions for disseminated MAC in HIV-infected patients. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a central regulatory cytokine in cell-mediated immunity. IL-12 enhances the cytolytic activity of cytotoxic T and NK cells and induces interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) production from T and NK cells. This open-label Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunologic/microbiologic effects of interleukin-12 administration in HIV-infected patients with concomitant disseminated Mycobacterium avium (MAC) infection. Fifteen patients with documented disseminated MAC will be randomized to receive double-blinded placebo or escalating doses of IL-12 in addition to anti-MAC chemotherapy and standard anti-retroviral therapy for six weeks. IL-12 will be administered subcutaneously with escalating doses every month over the dose range of 30 ng/kg 100 ng/kg and 300 ng/kg or until an individual maximum tolerated dose (IMTD) is reached. Should a patient receive 2 consecutive blood cultures negative for MAC during the course of the study at a lower dose then he/she will not be further dose escalated. Those patients receiving placebo after 6 weeks will be crossed over to receive the full treatment course of IL-12. Each new dose or dose escalation will take place on an inpatient basis. Once a patient is clinically stable at a dose the patient will be maintained at that dose as an outpatient for the remainder of the month. Total IL-12 administration will not exceed 12 weeks or 24 total doses.    ,NCT00001763
HIV,Once-Daily Drug Regimen for HIV-Infected Patients, This study will examine the safety of giving antiviral therapy for HIV infection in a once-daily dosing schedule and assess how well patients tolerate this regimen. A once a day dosing schedule may be easier for some people to follow than one that requires taking medicine 2 or 3 times a day. The ease of treatment is important because not following the prescribed dosing regimen may make therapy less effective or ineffective. HIV-infected patients 18 years and older who have never been treated for their infection may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a history and physical examination including blood tests. Participants will take the following medications once a day: 1200 mg of amprenavir (8 capsules); 300 mg of ritonavir (3 capsules); 600 mg of abacavir (2 pills); and 300 mg of lamivudine (2 pills). Patients will have routine blood tests and be seen by a nurse or doctor or both at follow-up visits at weeks 2 4 8 12 and 16; then every 8 weeks until week 48; and then every 3 months for up to 3 years. At week 2 a special blood test will be done over the course of a day to measure blood drug levels. For this test blood samples will be drawn 8 times over a 24-hour period. A heparin lock (a device that allows the needle to remain in the vein) will be used to avoid multiple needle sticks.    ,NCT00001968

HIV,Efficacy of Elevated CD4 Counts on CMV Retinitis, Some patients with HIV/AIDS suffer from a dangerous viral infection of the retina (and other organs) called cytomegalovirus infection (CMV). The medications currently used to treat CMV all have serious side effects. AIDS patients are prone to this infection because their immune system produces a lower number of CD4+T lymphocytes the type of blood cells that fight viral infections. Some new HIV medications strengthen the immune system. This study will investigate the possibility that CMV patients on these HIV medications can develop immune systems strong enough to fight CMV without CMV medication. The study will enroll a maximum of 15 adult HIV/AIDS patients who have a CD4+T cell count over 150 cells/microliter and who have inactive CMV retinitis that is not immediately sight threatening. It is expected to last approximately 2 years. Each prospective participant will have a physical examination and complete eye examination including retina photographs with the eye examination and retina photographs repeated 2 weeks later. If there is no evidence of active CMV retinitis the participant will be enrolled in the study and CMV medication will be stopped. The participant will have physical and eye examinations every 2 weeks for the first 3 months of the study and every 3 weeks for the next 3 months. After 6 months the frequency of the examinations will be 2-8 weeks depending on the participant's CD4 count. After one year a participant with a CD4 count remaining over 150 cells/microliter may return to the care of a local ophthalmologist with HIV/CMV experience revisiting the clinical center every 6 months. The participant's CMV medication will be restarted when CMV retinitis becomes active which will terminate participation in the study.    ,NCT00091884

HIV,Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H MRS) in Evaluating the Bone Marrow Muscle and Adipose Tissue on Normal and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Subjects, Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is commonly applied in medicine with 1H proton or 31-phosphorus spectra. The proton MRS is often used in evaluating the central nervous system and 31P MRS is used in muscular diseases or neoplasms. However the proton MRS is also considered to be applied to the musculoskeletal system because of its profound amount of protons. Ballon used the STEAM technique and Schick used the PRESS technique to investigate the lipid and water spectra of the bone marrow and also correlated those with hematological diseases and post-treatment effects. Schellinger et al. used the STEAM sequence to calculate the lipid content of the vertebral bone marrow and found that it was influenced according to age and sex. The investigator had used the proton MRS to evaluate the lipid and water spectra of the femoral head and revealed its significance in predicting avascular necrosis of the femoral head. According to the above research literature the investigators considered further investigation of the proton MRS in evaluating the musculoskeletal system.    ,NCT00172315

HIV,Longitudinal Study of HAART Social Networks & Adherence, Our study is a randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) to (1) increase both short and long term adherence to HAART treatment and (2) improve clinical outcomes associated with HAART therapy. Our hypothesis is that modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) during the initial 6 weeks of HAART supervised primarily by HIV-positive lay activists will improve adherence and clinical outcomes compared with those that do not have supervised mDOT. We also hypothesize that the benefits of mDOT will be achieved through a variety of mediators that will result from the social interactions the patients will have with the activists. These mediators include improved social support improved knowledge about HAART reduced stigma and improved self-efficacy.    ,NCT00272220

HIV,HIV Prevention Intervention for Couples, Recent studies have shown that many drug-using minority women are vulnerable to HIV infection from their husbands or other intimate male partners. The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate two new HIV counseling and testing programs designed for drug-using women at risk for HIV from a primary male partner. It is predicted that HIV counseling and testing programs administered to couples rather than to women only and programs that focus on intimate relationships in the context of HIV risk will result in a reduction of risky sexual and drug-related behavior among drug-using women and their primary male partners. This four-year study employs a randomized clinical trial (RCT) design to test the effectiveness of two new HIV counseling and testing programs for women drug-users in Harlem and the South Bronx in New York City.    ,NCT00325585
HIV,Relationship of Viral Resistance Development to CD4 Monitoring Alone or With Viral Load Monitoring, This study will examine whether HIV-infected patients are more likely to develop resistance to antiretroviral therapy if their blood is not monitored for the number of viruses (viral load) in the body. A virus that changes (mutates) over time may become resistant to certain types of medicine. This resistance may affect future treatment options. This study will compare the amount of virus in the blood of HIV-infected patients who have been monitored for viral load with the amount of virus in the blood of patients who have not been monitored for viral load. For patients who have detectable virus the type of resistance (mutations) of the virus will be determined by comparing the components of the virus with that of a virus that is known not to be resistant. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age or older who are being treated at the Infectious Diseases Institute at Mulago Hospital at Makerere University in Kampala Uganda may be eligible for this study. Participants are interviewed about the treatments they have received for HIV and how they usually take their anti-HIV drugs. They also have a blood sample drawn for research tests.    ,NCT00434070

HIV,CD4 Cell Recovery in HIV-1 Patients Comparing 2 Treatment Regimes, Therapy guidelines recommend the use of either the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz or a ritonavir-boostered protease inhibitor (PI) plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) as first-line treatment regimes of HIV-1 infection. Recent clinical studies suggest potential advantages of NNRTI- over PI-based regimes in therapy initiation due to lower rates of virologic failure and less metabolic side-effects. In contrast PI regimes were claimed to cause greater increases in CD4 cell count than NNRTI regimes which has been attributed to intrinsic antiapoptotic effects of the PI. However it is still unclear whether the immunological response to a PI-containing regime is greater than to an NNRTI-containing regime whether there is a difference in the extent of reduction of apoptosis between PI and NNRTI regimes and whether a difference in apoptosis is associated with a difference in CD4 cell recovery. We conducted a controlled long-term random matched pair design study in HIV-1 infected individuals under sustained virologic suppression to evaluate in head-to-head comparison the clinical effects of a constant PI-based or NNRTI-based regime on CD4 cell recovery and the underlying molecular biochemical and functional mechanisms.    ,NCT00966160

HIV,Study of the Effect of Atorvastatin for Reducing Aging-related Complication in HIV-infected Patients Older Than 45 Years Receiving a Protease Inhibitor-based Regimen Versus a Raltegravir-based Regimen, Physicians in charge of HIV-infected patients are increasingly being faced to previously unrecognized comorbid conditions such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events loss of renal function osteopenia/osteoporosis and bone fractures or non-AIDS-defining cancers (1-4). The incidence of these conditions seems to be higher than in the general population but there are controversial data about if these diseases appear at a younger age in HIV-infected patients. The investigators propose a strategy for treatment of elderly HIV-infected patients with a double impact on systemic inflammation and age-related co-morbidities by switching the protease inhibitors by raltegravir a integrase inhibitor with a neutral effect on lipid and bone metabolism and adding an statin because of their anti-inflammatory effect. For safety reasons only patients with maintained viral suppression (documented indetectable viral load for 1 year or more) and no history of virological failure to integrase inhibitors or suspected or documented resistance mutations to the integrase or retrotranscriptase will be candidates for the study. Interleukin -6 and D-dimer are biomarkers that most strongly predict mortality in treated HIV infection and sCD14 sCD163 are soluble markers of monocyte activation that reflect a key source of inflammation and coagulation in HIV infection and predict mortality (2627). For that reasons these markers were chosen to determine changes on them after the introduction of the statin and the change of antiretrovirals    ,NCT02577042
HIV,CSP #512 - Options in Management With Anti-Retrovirals, This 'pragmatic' trial is a 2X2 open randomized study of patients in advanced HIV disease who have failed on conventional Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) regimens including all three classes of anti-HIV drugs. The first randomization will allocate patients to an intended 3-month antiretroviral drug-free period (ARDFP) or No ARDFP. The second randomization will allocate patients to Mega-ART (5+ drugs) or to Standard-ART (up to 4 drugs). The total study duration is 6.5 years with 5 years of intake and 1.5 year (minimum) of follow-up; median duration of patient follow-up is about 4 years. The target sample size is 390 patients and will provide 75% power to detect a 30% reduction in the hazard rate for the primary endpoint with mega-ART. Sixty-four sites will be participating in the trial--24 VA 19 UK and 21 Canada.    ,NCT00050089
HIV,Investigation of V520 in an HIV Vaccine Proof-of-Concept Study (V520-023), This study will test the safety and efficacy of an investigational Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) vaccine. Efficacy will be measured by either prevention of HIV infection or control of HIV viral load in subjects who become HIV infected. On September 18 2007 the Protocol V520-023 DSMB (Data & Safety Monitoring Board) reviewed data from a planned interim analysis. These data demonstrated that the investigational vaccine candidate was not effective and all vaccinations in the study were halted. Participants were encouraged to continue to come to the clinic for scheduled visits and ongoing risk reduction counseling since the vaccine was not effective.    ,NCT00095576

HIV,Socioenvironmental Determinants of Psychological Functioning Mental Health and AIDS in Mali, This project is a collaboration between the Centre Regional de Medecine Traditionnelle (CRMT) of the Malian National Institute of Public Health Research (INRSP) and the Section on Socioenvironmental Studies (SSES). These units developed a three-pronged protocol reflecting their joint and individual concerns:   1. Effects of occupational complexity on psychological functioning. The project tests a theory derived from previous SSES research demonstrating that in industrialized societies doing relatively self-directed substantively complex work increases self-directed orientations to self society and family and promotes effective intellectual functioning. It uses sociological survey methodology to determine the generalizability of this theory to an essentially pre-literate preindustrial society.   2. Effects of work-related stress on mental health. Earlier SSES work demonstrated that stressful work conditions lead to distress in industrialized societies. This project extends the investigation of these effects to a non-industrialized setting. It also extends the investigation of work-related stress to include work-related migration resting a hypothesis that relates equally to SSES and CRMT concerns: that individuals from rural ethnic groups with a cultural tradition of work-related migration will show fewer mental health problems when migrating for nontraditional work than those from cultures without such a tradition. Mental health problems are assessed through: a) adaptations of standard survey-based psychological measures of components of distress b) general and culture-specific survey-based psychiatric screening questions and c) a psychiatric interview conducted by a CRMT psychiatrist trained in internationally accepted diagnostic procedures and knowledgeable about local cultures.   3. The effects of migration and cultural and socioeconomic factors on AIDS-related knowledge attitudes and behaviors. The survey addresses concern regarding the degree of knowledge about the nature of AIDS among rural Malians who are relatively isolated from urban oriented sources of information about culturally non-traditional issues. It also examines how socio-cultural background and migration for work affect AIDS related attitudes and self-reported behaviors in an African society where estimates of HIV prevalence are still relatively low (less than 2%) compared to those of other sub-Saharan African countries. Although these prongs are distinguishable each requires a longitudinal design a representative sample extensive information about responders' social and cultural backgrounds occupational histories work conditions and personal orientations and beliefs. Because of their overlapping theoretical approaches and methodological requirements combining them in one project increases the richness and efficiency of the data collected for each.    ,NCT00339391
HIV,The Effects of Genetic Differences Among AIDS Patients on Cytomegalovirus Retinitis, This study will evaluate the role of certain gene variants on the onset and course of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis-a severe infection affecting the eye-in patients with AIDS. Symptoms include blurry vision eye pain photophobia floaters eye redness and impaired vision. Left untreated it can cause blindness. The study is done in collaboration with investigators of the Longitudinal Studies of the Ocular Complications of AIDS (LSOCA) at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The purpose of the LSOCA study is to learn about how HIV and other infections associated with AIDS and their treatments affect people's eyes and sight. Blood samples previously collected from patients participating in the LSOCA study will be analyzed for gene variants. These differences will then be correlated with the patients' clinical data to try to discover the role of gene differences among patients on the following: susceptibility to CMV and related problems; development and course of CMV; and response to HAART (highly active antiretroviral treatment) particularly in CMV onset and pathology. The study will use blood samples and clinical information previously collected from patients during their participation in LSOCA. The materials will be identified with a numerical code linking the samples and clinical data. No additional procedures will be performed on patients for this study.    ,NCT00341172

HIV,Pathogenesis of Glomerulosclerosis, The present protocol seeks to advance our understanding of sclerosing glomerular and tubulointerstitial kidney diseases including but not limited to variants of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu). This protocol will encompass studies of the natural history pathogenesis and treatment of these chronic kidney disorders. It will also allow us to: (1) provide second opinions to referring physicians about management of subjects with these relatively rare kidney diseases; (2) collect research samples (e.g. blood) urine and kidney tissue obtained from clinically-indicated or from research renal biopsies); (3) and treat these subjects with standard or other approved therapies; or (4) invite selected subjects patients to participate in limited pilot studies of novel combinations of standard therapeutic agents such as rituximab and cyclosporine. (5) Agricultural worker chronic kidney disease of undetermined etiology (CKDu) is a growing problem in tropical countries in the Americas and Asia including Sri Lanka where collaborators are located. We will receive kidney tissue from 25 CKDu cases for pathologic examination and transcriptional profiling and blood plasma serum urine for metabolomic and genetic analysis from 50 cases and controls. Subjects were consented and samples were collected under a protocol approved by the University of Colombo IRB. These studies may provide the opportunity to generate new hypotheses regarding pathogenesis and treatment that would be candidates for testing in other research protocols. Subjects with known or suspected forms of sclerosing glomerular or chronic fibrosing tubulointerstitial kidney diseases will undergo routine medical evaluation laboratory testing imaging procedures and kidney biopsies as medically indicated. Selected subjects will be invited to provide informed consent to undergo a kidney biopsy for research purposes. Blood urine and tissue samples will be evaluated both for standard diagnostic purposes and for research purposes using specialized molecular methods that may provide insights into specific disease pathogenesis. Subjects may elect to receive the results of their kidney disease evaluation NIH treatment recommendations and return to the care of their referring physicians. Other subjects may be treated with either conventional or approved agents or (with separate consent) with a novel combination of conventional therapies (rituximab and cyclosporine) as part of pilot studies that would involve long-term follow-up care at the NIH.    ,NCT00001392

HIV,Comparison of 2'3'-Dideoxyinosine (Didanosine ddI) and Zidovudine in Therapy of Patients With the AIDS Dementia Complex, To compare the safety and effectiveness of orally administered didanosine (ddI) with high dose orally administered zidovudine (AZT) in patients who develop or exhibit progression of the AIDS dementia complex (ADC) and who have not previously been intolerant to AZT at doses of up to 1000 mg/day. HIV-infected or AIDS patients may develop ADC which causes damage to the nervous system. ADC may be caused by some action of the AIDS virus on the nervous system although similar problems can be caused by other infections because the AIDS virus lowers the body's ability to fight other infections. It is important to determine whether symptoms are due to ADC or to some other infection since treatment varies for different conditions. AZT has been shown to be beneficial to people with ADC although its effectiveness has only been studied in a small number of patients. Studies suggest that higher doses of AZT are more likely to be effective than standard doses in improving symptoms of ADC.    ,NCT00000657
HIV,A Multicenter Placebo-Controlled Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate Azidothymidine (AZT) Treatment of the AIDS Dementia Complex and Central Nervous System (CNS) Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection, To test whether zidovudine (AZT) is useful as a treatment for the neurologic syndrome called AIDS dementia complex. To determine how long AZT takes to reach cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) how long and at what concentration it is found there. HIV infection can result in impairment in the function of the brain and spinal cord leading to disturbances in the ability to think clearly and in strength and coordination. This disorder which has been called the AIDS dementia complex may be due to a direct effect of HIV on the nervous system. It is known that AZT does get into the brain to some extent where it may reduce growth of HIV. It is hoped that AZT will stabilize or improve the symptoms of the AIDS dementia complex.    ,NCT00000702
HIV,An Open Trial of Zidovudine (AZT) Treatment of the AIDS Dementia Complex in Patients With AIDS or Low CD4+ Lymphocyte Counts, To provide accurate and complete neurologic assessment of the course of the AIDS dementia complex in patients treated with zidovudine (AZT). The study will determine how frequently patients improve how long improvement is sustained and the magnitude and functional significance of improvement. Individuals with AIDS frequently suffer central nervous system (CNS) problems that are characterized by cognitive motor and behavioral deficits in a disorder known as AIDS dementia complex. Clinical experience suggests that its course is often progressive going from initial symptoms to moderate or severe dementia within several months. Accumulating evidence now suggests that direct brain infection by the HIV virus is the likely cause of the AIDS dementia complex. Case reports suggest that therapy with AZT which has been shown to be a strong inhibitor of HIV replication in vitro may alleviate the AIDS dementia complex. This study will help define the natural history of the AIDS dementia complex in treated patients.    ,NCT00000709
HIV,Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial of Nimodipine for the Neurological Manifestations of HIV-1, PRIMARY: To assess the safety of nimodipine in the treatment of HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex (formerly AIDS dementia complex). To assess the systemic or central nervous system toxicities (e.g. rash headache gastrointestinal symptoms nausea dyspnea muscle pain or cramp acne) of nimodipine. SECONDARY: To assess the efficacy of nimodipine in stabilizing the progression of HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex by improvement in neuropsychological test performance peripheral neuropathy or other neurologic manifestations. HIV-infected patients may develop a condition known as HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex (also known as AIDS dementia complex) that causes damage to the nervous system particularly the brain and spinal cord. Evidence exists that nimodipine protects nerve cells in culture from injury by HIV. Although nimodipine has been used in patients with other neurological problems its safety and effectiveness in halting the progression of HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex is not yet known.    ,NCT00000738
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Use of Memantine In Combination With Anti-HIV Drugs to Treat AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC), The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of memantine an experimental drug in improving AIDS dementia complex (ADC). The symptoms of ADC can be improved with zidovudine (ZDV). However ZDV therapy has been associated with significant toxicities and the effectiveness of ZDV seems to decrease during the second and third years of therapy. The effectiveness of other antiretroviral drugs as treatment for ADC is not known so it is important to explore alternative therapies.    ,NCT00000867
HIV,A Pilot Study To Evaluate the Effect of Retrovir (Zidovudine: AZT) in the Treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Associated Dementia and Neuromuscular Diseases, The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy of Retrovir (AZT) in the treatment of AIDS-related dementia and various neuromuscular complications. HIV is both a lymphotropic and neurotropic virus which can affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS PNS). There is evidence that the CNS and PNS may harbor the virus in a latent state with the potential for continuous reinfection of other body systems. Therefore effective therapeutic efforts against HIV infection should provide effective antiviral activity within the nervous system.    ,NCT00002044
HIV,A Phase III Randomized Double-Blind Multicentre Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of 1592U89 in Patients With AIDS Dementia Complex, To evaluate the benefit of adding 1592U89 to current antiretroviral therapies for AIDS dementia complex and to assess the safety and tolerance of the treatment regimens.    ,NCT00002163

HIV,"Evaluation of Therapeutic Management in ESBL-infected Patients or Carriers by Providing and Sharing a Free Tool - the ""ESBL toolKIT""and Interventional Study of a Prospective Cohort of HIV+ Patients Searching for Possible Sexual Transmission Factors in ESBL Carriers"," Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major public health problem. The epidemiology of enteric bacteria including E. coli is changing rapidly with the global spread of a resistance mechanism type beta-lactamase extended spectrum (ESBL) responsible for resistance to almost all penicillins and cephalosporins. The resistance is up to 75% for Quinolones 67% for Cotrimoxazole and 30-50% for Aminoglycosides. The main phenomena causing this problem are:   -  The selection pressure by antibiotics in their use in humans or animals   -  The hand transmission via the digestive reservoir (faeces)   -  Easy spread of resistance mechanism in Enterobacteriaceae due to transferable genetic support (plasmid) In this context we decided to implement a cross-border study to improve and accelerate the management diagnosis and treatment of patients with ESBL in close collaboration between medical and paramedical staff in hospitals laboratories and private medical offices. The objective of this study is to standardize diagnostic and therapeutic measures allowing a better and rapid treatment of patients and thus prevent the appearence of ESBL bacteria in the PACA region and Liguria by providing a tool : The ""Kit ESBL"". The "" ESBL ToolKIT"" (also translated into Italian) includes:   -  Information on epidemiological data   -  A checklist edited for extra-hospital use (private practitioners health care units other than hospitals)   -  A checklist edited for hospital use   -  A leaflet BMR for the patient explaining the problematic as well as hygiene measures   -  Therapeutical protocols for hospital use and extra hospital use   -  An sample letter for the attending physician The objective of this prospective multicenter cohort study is to evaluate the use of this kit and to measure its impact on:   -  The prescription of appropriate antibiotics   -  The measures taken to prevent man to man transmission   -  The quality of information provided to the patient In this context we are also performing a multicentre prospective interventional cohort of HIV+ patients searching for possible sexual transmission factors in ESBL (extended-spectrum ß-lacatamase-producing bacteria) carriers. We will also try to determine if other sexually transmitted infections associated (syphilis gonorrhea and chlamydia) are contributing factors to ESBL carriage. So far there is no data documented on ESBL-carriage in a population of HIV-positive patients.    ",NCT02011009

HIV,Phase 1 Safety Study of Two Experimental HIV Vaccines, This study will test whether two experimental HIV vaccines are safe and whether they cause any side effects in healthy adults. It will examine the body s immune response to the vaccines and monitor the social impact if any of being in an HIV vaccine study. The experimental vaccines in this study are the VRC-HIVADV027-00-VP (also called the rAd35-EnvA vaccine) and VRC-HIVADV038-00-VP (also called the rAd5-EnvA vaccine). The vaccines are made using an adenovirus (virus that normally causes respiratory infections and colds) that has been modified to contain DNA that codes for HIV proteins. The vaccines cannot cause HIV or adenoviral infections. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this 2-part study. Part 1 includes 15 people. Part 2 includes 20 people. Part 1 participants receive only the rAd35-EnvA vaccine. The first five people enrolled receive the lowest study dose of the vaccine. If this dose is safe then the next five people enrolled receive a higher dose. If this dose is safe then the last 5 people enrolled receive the highest study dose. Subjects in Part I have about five clinic visits over 24 weeks. Part II of the study starts after all injections in Part 1 are given. Subjects in Part 2 are randomly assigned to one of two vaccination schedules. One group receives the rAd35-EnvA vaccine first followed 12 weeks later with the rAd5-EnvA vaccine. The other group receives the vaccines in reverse order; that is first the rAd5-EnvA vaccine followed 12 weeks later with the rAd35-EnvA vaccine. In this schedule the first vaccination primes the immune system and then the immune response is boosted 12 weeks later with a different vaccine. Everyone in study Part 2 receives the rAd35-EnvA vaccine at the middle dose tested in Part 1. Subjects in Part 2 have about eight clinic visits over 36 weeks. All vaccinations are given as injections in the upper arm. At each clinic visit participants are checked for health changes or problems. They are asked how they are feeling and if they have taken any medications. Urine samples are collected and blood is drawn at some visits. They are tested for HIV several times and asked questions about their sexual behavior and drug use. Throughout the study participants are counseled on HIV risk reduction. Subjects are asked about any social effects they may have experienced from their participation in this study.    ,NCT00479999

Smoking is one of the major contributing factors to these health problems and rates of cigarette smoking in this group are substantially higher than those of the general population: 40-70% vs. 17-10%. Especially women living with HIV/AIDS seem to be more susceptible to the negative consequence of smoking than their male counterparts. They are also less likely to see tobacco dependence treatment for dual stigma associated with both conditions: HIV infection and nicotine addiction. This is a pilot study to develop smoking cessation intervention for these women.    ,NCT02898597
HIV,Rapid Oral Test for Therapeutic Response in HIV/AIDS Patients, This study has been designed to evaluate a new oral test for therapeutic monitoring of HIV/AIDS patients that are receiving the combination Anti-Retroviral Therapy (cART). The test will measure saliva-based Stress Response Profiling(SRP) biomarkers using laboratory assays. Results of the test will show if HIV/AIDS patients successfully responded to cART. Preliminary studies showed that SRP biomarkers were strongly increased in cART-unresponsive AIDS patients. However the diagnostic accuracy of the oral test patients will be recruited to donate saliva: AIDS patients responsive or unresponsive to cART and controls (acute or early HIV patients and HIV-negative patients with hepatitis). The saliva samples will be used to measure SRP biomarker concentrations. Results will show whether the biomarker measurements provide accurate and specific diagnostics for ART response.    ,NCT01507142
HIV,The Impact of Short-term Financial Incentives on Sexual Behavior and HIV Incidence in Lesotho," The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a major concern in many countries. The epidemic is especially acute in Lesotho where roughly one quarter of the population is infected by HIV/AIDS. In Lesotho and elsewhere new innovative approaches to induce safer sexual behavior have been desperately called for particularly in view of the limited impact that existing prevention schemes have had on the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. One of the key questions is to understand why individuals get involved in short-term risky sexual behavior when the potential long-term cost of becoming HIV infected is so high? A follow-up question is what replicable and feasible interventions can affect this trade-off between short and long run returns? The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether the use of short-term financial incentives can affect this trade-off thereby influencing young individuals' decisions with respect to sexual and reproductive health behavior and thus in the end reduce HIV incidence rates. The investigators will study this question using a sample of population attending served by New Start Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) sites that a local NGO Population Service International (PSI) has already implemented in Lesotho. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test whether adding a financial incentive to remain STI-negative in the form of a lottery can promote safer sexual activity. The lotteries will work as follows: if the individual is tested negative on a set of curable STIs she will get a lottery ticket with the chance to win a ""big"" prize. If she is tested positive she will receive free treatment but no lottery ticket. If an individual who tested positive is cured she can come back in the lottery system and get a later chance to win the lottery ticket if she remains STI-negative. The outcome will be to measure the impact of financial incentives on HIV incidence after two years. The results of this research project will be disseminated through academic and non-academic conferences workshops publications in academic journals and also in policy journals with the aim to reach out to policy makers outside the research community.

HIV,Cardiovascular Risk in HIV Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy Therapy: The MHEART Study, CVD accounts for 15% of all deaths in Malawi. Both HIV and ART are risk factors for CVD through direct toxic and inflammatory cardiovascular effects. (4445). At the moment one out of every 10 Malawian is HIV positive and roughly 8 out of 10 of those infected are now on ART (2). Therefore HIV and ART may be contributing to the burden of CVD in Malawi. Currently there are only a few studies assessing CVD risk in the HIV patient population on ART. In Malawi no such studies exist. Therefore the investigators propose a novel study assessing baseline cardiovascular disease risk using two novel ultrasound technologies in HIV patients on ART. Cardiovascular disease risk will be assessed using surrogate cardiovascular markers of disease. These surrogates include markers of endothelial function and cardiovascular modulating inflammatory biomarkers. The inflammatory biomarkers measured will be TNF-alpha IL-6 and CRP. Aspirin by way of its antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory effect has been demonstrated to inhibit atherosclerosis by way of decreasing TNF-alpha IL-6 CRP and improving endothelial function. Therefore a second aim of the study will be to demonstrate that aspirin improves surrogate markers of atherosclerosis.    ,NCT02401269

HIV,Point-of-care Viral Load Testing to Enable Streamlined Care and Task Shifting for Chronic HIV Care, Effective management of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential to improve clinical outcomes and prevent HIV transmission but monitoring life-long ART for over 15 million HIV-infected people has become a challenge particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). As programs continue to focus on identifying HIV-infected people and starting ART at higher CD4 thresholds HIV providers have been overburdened which has resulted in falling retention rates. As ART coverage scales up to include millions more people additional strain will be placed on HIV clinicians and laboratories to manage stable patients on chronic ART. Implementing point-of-care HIV VL testing to enable task shifting to nurses for chronic HIV care may help mitigate these burdens. Point-of-care Viral Load (VL) testing is intended to differentiate patients who are potentially failing on their ART so that they can be referred to the next level of care for possible ART regiment change from patients who are virally suppressed on ART and can be managed by nurses. The investigator's scientific objective is to test the clinical equivalence and reduced cost of implementing a model for chronic HIV care that uses a point-of-care HIV VL assay to enable streamlined care and task shifting among healthcare workers at an urban clinic in South Africa. The central hypothesis is that rapid HIV VL testing implemented by nurses is an effective and cost-efficient strategy for management of chronic HIV infection in the majority of patients thereby allowing more resources to be directed at the minority of patients who need greater attention. This work is innovative because it uses a randomized evaluation of an implementation model that combines a novel diagnostic point-of-care test with streamlined care and task shifting among healthcare workers compared to standard of care for chronic HIV care in a resource-limited setting. This randomized trial will then form the basis of a larger multicountry proposal to demonstrate the clinical equivalence and cost-effectiveness of implementing an integrated point-of-care HIV VL testing and streamlined care model for chronic HIV care in LMICs. If nurses using clinic-based HIV VL testing are cost-effective for achieving both viral suppression and retention in care among patients on ART then implementation of this chronic HIV care model would alleviate the strain on existing HIV providers and laboratories in LMICs.    ,NCT03066128
HIV,Chidamide in Combination With Antiretroviral Therapy for Eradication of the Latent HIV-1 Reservoir," HIV replication can be effectively suppressed and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS) can be prevented with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However HIV-infected people must remain on treatment continuously to avoid viral rebound and progression to AIDS. HIV persistence is thought to stem primarily from the presence of integrated copies of the proviral genome within long-lived cells. Because active viral gene expression causes cell death due to viral cytopathic effects and the immune response long-lived cells likely harbor transcriptionally silent latent provirus. HIV-1 persistence in long-lived cellular reservoirs remains a major barrier to a cure. HDACi have the potential to activate (""Kick"") these latently infected cells. This will make the HIV infected cells visible to the immune system; the immune response and antiretrovirals(ARVs) will be able to attack and eliminate (""Kill"") the infected cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multi-dose Chidamide in combination with antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected adults with suppressed viral load.    ",NCT02513901

HIV,Towards HIV Functional Cure," During the ERAMUNE-01 and -02 studies the HIV-DNA quantification in the PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) showed showed that some patients had a very low or undetectable reservoir. Recent studies showed that a low reservoir is associated to a spontaneous virologic control in three specific categories of patients:   -  ""Elite Controllers"": these rare patients are able to spontaneously maintain an HIV-RNA viral load below 50 copies/mL and elevated CD4 counts without any treatment. These patients belong to the B27/B57 haplotypes associated to a reduced risk of HIV contamination but these haplotypes are very rare in the global population (03 %)   -  ""Visconti"" patients: early-treated patients during the primo-infection stage. After 3 to 5 years of treatment these patients are able to maintain an undetectable HIV-RNA viral load.   -  ""Salto"" patients: these patients are treated a bit later compared to the Visconti cohort when their CD4 count was above 350 cells/mm3 and their HIV-RNA viral load below 50 000 copies/mL. The follow-up of these patients showed the same capacity of control of the HIV infection for at least 2 years following treatment interruption. Taking into account these 3 categories of patients which common characteristics is a low reservoir our objective is to answer the 2 following questions:   1. Is it possible to discontinue the treatment in chronically-infected patients with a ""normal"" immune system and with an undetectable HIV-DNA reservoir?   2. Is a low viral reservoir predictive of a treatment-free remission of the HIV infection in chronically-infected patients? The main objective of the proof-of-concept ERAMUNE-03 trial is to evaluate the proportion of patients in success (i.e. able to maintain a virologic and an immunologic control of the infection) after treatment discontinuation failure is defined as:   -  An HIV-RNA viral load > 400 copies/mL on 2 consecutive tests starting from Week 4   -  Or CD4 count < 400 cells/mm3 on 2 consecutive measures starting from Week 4   -  Or the onset of an AIDS-related event    ",NCT01876862

HIV,Put a Face to a Name (Part A): The Effects of Photographic Aids on Patient Satisfaction Clinician Communication and Quality of Care, Communication is critical within healthcare and is the root cause of most errors. With increased adoption and use of new information technologies and mediated communication systems such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) that support visual content hospitals can begin to look at the potential of photographic aids to improve patient satisfaction clinician communication and ultimately quality of care. Having pictures of clinicians and patients may improve communication by improving knowledge of who is part of the care team and may reduce electronic ordering or documentation on the wrong patient. Despite the importance of communication between clinicians and the many advances within information and communication technologies there is a lack of literature documenting systems that are effective at improving communication. Our research study will provide an overview on the communication models and technologies used in Canadian hospitals and add insights to the impacts of these technological adoption. Research Question: How does the use of photographic influence patients' hospital experience? Specifically do photographic aids (photographs of clinicians' faces) influence:   1. Patient's ability to identify their clinical care team members   2. Patient's ability to identify their care team members and know their individual roles   3. Patient's satisfaction with their hospital experience    ,NCT01658644
HIV,Overcoming Barriers to HIV/AIDS Care and ART Initiation, The study will evaluate interventions to improve engagement in HIV care following HIV diagnosis through a voluntary counseling and testing program. The specific aims are to (1) determine if a VCT-based intervention of CD4 count testing alone or in combination with peer counseling improves linkage to HIV/AIDS care; (2) assess the impact of the intervention on ART initiation. The study will recruit 450 HIV-positive individuals from VCTs and randomize a third to standard counseling and referral a third to receive CD4 testing at the VCT with results return by phone after 1 weeks and a third to receive the same CD4 testing combined with peer counseling. These combined investigations will create a comprehensive understanding of obstacles to appropriate HIV/AIDS care and result in new interventions to achieve measurable outcomes in applied settings.    ,NCT02718456

HIV,Search for Fragility Indicators Among People Aged 50+ With Chronic HIV Infection, The frailty and frail elderly was defined in 2001 by Fried as a physiological state of heightened vulnerability to external shocks. 5 criteria for classifying the elderly in 3 categories: frail pre-frail and not frail. The prevalence of frailty in the general population was estimated to be 7% 10% and 20% for over 65 years and 45% for over 85 years. This concept is explored in some chronic diseases in order to prevent the loss of autonomy and tailor the treatment. In the carrier population of HIV a North American retrospective study showed the frailty syndrome manifested as early as 10 years before than in the general population. Furthermore various studies show in this specific population increased incidence of diseases linked to age suggesting an accelerated and premature aging. objectives: The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of frailty defined Fried syndrome in a population of subjects aged 50 and over Holders of chronic HIV infection.    ,NCT02874118
HIV,Study to Assess Community-based Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Monoinfection and Coinfection With HIV in the District of Columbia, Background: - Treatment for Hepatitis C has changed a lot in the past 2 years. Most of this change comes from a combination of medicines that is yielding high cure rates. But its long-term effects are uncertain. One problem is that a lot of people need the treatment but only a few specialists can give it. The success rate for Hepatitis C treatment by primary care doctors nurse practitioners or physician assistants is largely unknown. Researchers want to see how provider type affects treatment outcomes. They will conduct a large community-based study in the District of Columbia. Objectives: - To see if people can be treated for Hepatitis C safely and successfully in community-based health centers. Eligibility: - Adults who need treatment for chronic Hepatitis C infection. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with blood tests. Their current medicines will be reviewed.   -  Participants will give researchers access to their medical records. Researchers will follow participants through these records.   -  Participants will see a primary care or infectious disease provider. The provider will tell them about their treatment. They will be told how often they will visit the provider and how often they will have their blood drawn. They will get a calendar of study visits.   -  Participants will take Harvoni for 8 12 or 24 weeks. They will visit their care provider monthly.   -  Participants will have monthly follow-up visits for up to 3 months after they finish their medicine.   -  Participants will have yearly follow-up visits with their care provider for up to 10 years.    ,NCT02339038

Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination blood and urine tests and possibly an electrocardiogram (EKG). Blood tests may include HLA typing a genetic test of immune system markers. Participants may undergo the following procedures:   -  Blood tests (patients and volunteers)   -  Biopsies The frequency of biopsies for given patients may vary depending on their specific therapy. Typically biopsies are done at a single time or for patients starting a new therapy biopsies could be performed before starting therapy during therapy and possibly after completion of therapy.   -  Tonsil biopsies (patients and volunteers) Volunteers will have one tonsil biopsy. Patients will have no more than six tonsil biopsies with no more than three in a 10-day period. The biopsy is done by an ear nose and throat specialist as an outpatient procedure. The tonsils are numbed with a local anesthetic and one to four pieces of tissue are extracted.   -  Lymph node biopsies (patients only) Patients will have no more than four lymph node biopsies performed no more frequently than once a month. The biopsy is done by a surgeon and may require a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. The skin above the lymph nodes is numbed with a local anesthetic an incision is made and the tissue is removed. Alternatively a needle biopsy may be done in which a small amount of lymph tissue is withdrawn through a special needle injected into the site.   -  Intestinal biopsies (patients and volunteers) Volunteers will have one intestinal biopsy procedure. Patients may have up to six intestinal biopsy procedures each separated by at least 10 days. This is done by a gastroenterologist as an outpatient procedure.

DESIGN: Blood samples may be collected at the initial visit and at follow-up visits. Tumor samples may be obtained by fine needle aspirate by removal of pleural or peritoneal fluid by skin punch biopsy or by excisional biopsy providing the tumor is accessible with minimal risk to the patients. Specific risks will be described in a separate consent to be obtained at the time of the biopsy. Samples will be studied in the HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch CCR NCI; laboratories in NCI-Frederick; or those of collaborating investigators.    ,NCT00006518
HIV,Leukapheresis Procedures to Obtain Plasma and Lymphocytes for Research Studies on Primary and Chronic HIV-Infected Patients, There is evidence that early and aggressive treatment with antiretroviral drugs can prevent the loss of immune cell function that accompanies HIV infection. This study will use leukapheresis (drawing blood separating out the white cells and returning the blood to the patient) to obtain blood cells from HIV-infected patients in either the acute or chronic stage of infection who are being treated with early highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Leukapheresis is necessary to obtain enough cells to delineate the response of B cells to CD4+ T cell help the CD8 factors associated with suppression of viral replication and normalization of immune function and natural killer function relative to HIV disease. Study participants will be adult (older than 18 years) HIV primary or acutely affected patients (those with a history of exposure to HIV but not yet showing chronic symptoms of HIV disease) and HIV chronically infected patients (those infected with HIV for longer than 12 months or showing other symptoms of HIV disease) who are not receiving HAART at the beginning of the study. The study seeks to enroll 30 primary and 30 chronic patients. Pregnant women will not be enrolled in the study; women who become pregnant will be dropped from the study. Leukapheresis will be performed on each patient before HAART therapy begins and then three times a year. Each session will take between 1 and 3 hours. This longitudinal study will enable researchers to examine the function of certain B cells natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells in people who do not have chronic HIV disease and in those who do have the disease and are treated with HAART.    ,NCT00039689

HIV,Impact of Cotrimoxazole Prophylaxis for HIV-Infected Adults on Antifolate Resistance, At least three studies in sub-Saharan Africa have demonstrated a decrease in morbidity or mortality among HIV-infected adults who took daily cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole) [CTX] prophylaxis. Because of the demonstrated beneficial effect high tolerability and low cost of CTX the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) recommends that HIV-infected persons with symptomatic HIV or depressed CD4 counts receive daily CTX. The effect of this recommendation on subsequent development of antimicrobial resistance to antifolates among important pathogens needs to be evaluated. The investigators measured the change in the prevalence of markers of antifolate resistance among P. falciparum and the change in the prevalence of CTX resistance among S. pneumoniae and E. coli in HIV-infected individuals receiving CTX daily prophylaxis. In addition the investigators measured the change in the prevalence of naso-pharyngeal or oro-pharyngeal carriage of CTX resistant S. pneumoniae among children living in households where an HIV-infected adult was receiving CTX daily prophylaxis.    ,NCT00137657

HIV,Reducing Risk and Trauma-Related Stress in Persons Living With HIV, This two-year study tested the concept that an intervention which reduces trauma-related symptoms among adults who are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are experiencing trauma-related stress symptoms and engaging in behavior that facilitates HIV transmission can reduce the transmission risk of (HIV). Our central premise was that by first treating trauma symptoms we would enhance the effects of a skills-building HIV risk reduction intervention for adults experiencing trauma-related symptoms such as hyperarousal dissociation and avoidance. The study aims were to:   1. To determine if decreasing trauma-related stress symptoms improves HIV risk reduction behavior above a standard HIV risk reduction intervention alone post-intervention and 3 months after the small group intervention sessions;   2. To determine whether key variables moderate the intervention?s effects. For instance gender age ethnicity or psychological distress (e.g. depression anxiety) may interact with the intervention to affect risky sexual or drug-related behavior; and   3. To determine whether there is evidence that the theoretical mediator variables which include trauma-related stress symptoms self-efficacy communication skills and social support mediate the intervention?s effects on outcomes. This information addresses the theoretical question of why the intervention works.    ,NCT00186030

HIV,Safety and Immune Response to a Prime-Boost Vaccination Schedule in HIV-infected Patients, Study Design: This is a Phase I randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded study to examine safety tolerability and immune response of a prime-boost vaccination regimen for treatment of HIV infection. The vaccination schedule consists of three injections of a multiclade HIV plasmid DNA vaccine followed by one injection of a multiclade recombinant adenoviral vector vaccine (rAd) in HIV-infected adults. The hypothesis is that this vaccination regimen will be safe and elicit an immune response in HIV-infected subjects. The primary objectives are related to evaluating the safety and tolerability of the vaccination regimen and assessing the effect of vaccination on humoral and cellular immune responses to vaccine-specific HIV antigens. Product Description: VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP is composed of 6 closed circular DNA plasmids that are each 16.67% (by weight) of the vaccine. Each of the 6 plasmids in this vaccine expresses a single gene product. Plasmids VRC 4401 VRC 4409 and VRC 4404 are designed to express clade B HIV-1 Gag Pol and Nef respectively. VRC 5736 VRC 5737 and VRC 5738 are designed to express HIV-1 Env glycoprotein from clade A clade B and clade C respectively. Each DNA vaccination will be 1 mL of vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM) using the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) will be used as the placebo for the DNA vaccine. VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (rAd) is a recombinant product composed of 4 adenoviral vectors (Ad) (in a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A B and C respectively. Injections of 10(10) PU will be administered IM by needle and syringe. The final formulation buffer (FFB) will be used as the placebo for the rAd vaccine. Subjects: HIV-infected adult volunteers (18-50 years old) on stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) therapy who have a CD4+ cell count greater than 350 cells/mm3 and have had a viral load (VL) less than 400 copies/mL for at least six months and a viral load of less than 50 copies/mL within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Study Plan: Fifteen volunteers will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to vaccine:control (10 DNA prime with rAd boost:5 PBS with FFB placebo). A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the study every 6 months. Subjects will be evaluated for safety and immunogenicity for 48 weeks which is 24 weeks after the target date for the booster vaccination.

HIV,Sildenafil to Treat HIV-Associated Pulmonary Hypertension," This study will examine how blood pressure in the lungs is controlled in healthy people people with HIV and people with HIV and pulmonary artery hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs also called PAH). PAH sometimes develops in people with HIV but it is not known why this occurs or how best to treat it. Healthy volunteers and patients with HIV infection who are 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. All candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination electrocardiogram (EKG) chest x-ray echocardiogram and blood tests. Participants undergo the following procedures: All participants have a right heart catheterization and forearm blood flow study.   -  Catheterization study. A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in an arm vein and possibly in an artery in the arm. Then a large catheter is passed through a vein in the groin neck or chest. Through this ""introducer"" catheter another catheter is advanced into the right side of the heart and to the pulmonary artery. A facemask is put in place to measure the amount of nitric oxide produced by the lungs. Acetylcholine is infused through the catheter and its effects on blood pressure in the lungs and on the amount of nitric oxide exhaled is measured. After about 1 hour the catheter and facemask are removed and a new catheter is inserted through the introducer catheter into the pulmonary artery. The subject is moved into an MRI scanner where blood flow is measured after infusion of three different medications: acetylcholine (causes blood vessels to expand and slows heart rate); sodium nitroprusside (causes blood vessels to expand and increases blood flow to the heart); and L-NMMA (decreases blood flow by blocking production of nitric oxide in cells lining the blood vessels).   -  Blood flow study. Small tubes are inserted into the artery of the patient's forearm. These are used to infuse medicines and draw blood samples. Forearm blood flow is measured using pressure cuffs placed on the wrist and upper arm and a strain gauge (a rubber band device) placed around the forearm. When the cuffs are inflated blood flows into the arm stretching the strain gauge and the flow measurement is recorded. A small lamp is positioned over the hand to measure the light reflected from the hand and blood flow in the forearm. Blood samples are then drawn to measure blood counts and proteins and other natural body chemicals. Then forearm blood flow is measured after administration of small doses of sodium nitroprusside acetylcholine and L-NMMA. There is a 20- to 30-minute rest period between injections of the different drugs. In addition HIV-infected patients with PAH undergo the following tests to determine the cause of their PAH: CT scan of the lungs pulmonary function tests 6-minute walk test quality-of-life assessment assessment of difficulty in breathing exercise testing while measuring oxygen breathed in and carbon dioxide breathed out blood tests monitoring of oxygen saturation during sleep for 1 night and ventilation/perfusion scan. For the ventilation/perfusion scan the subject breathes in a small amount of radioactive aerosol while images are obtained of the radioactivity as it enters the lungs and then pictures of the lungs are taken from multiple angles. Next the patient receives an injection of tiny particles of albumin (a protein) containing a small amount of radioactivity and pictures of the lungs are taken that show the pattern of blood flow to the lungs. Patients with HIV and PAH who may benefit from the investigational drug sildenafil (commonly known as Viagra) may continue to participate in the next stage of the study. They receive the first dose of sildenafil after completing the forearm blood flow study. They continue the drug for 16 weeks returning to the clinic 1 week after the first dose and then every other week to monitor the response to treatment and drug side effects. At the end of 16 weeks patients return to the clinic for a repeat evaluation including blood tests 6-minute walk test echocardiogram right heart catheterization and forearm blood flow study.

HIV,HLA and KIR Associations With Infectious Viral Agents in an HIV Cohort of Women (WIHS), Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic the number of women infected with HIV has rapidly increased and is continuing to climb. The Women's Interagency HIV Study is being conducted in several cities in the United States to learn more about how HIV affects women's lives and bodies. It will examine the role of HLA and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) in HIV and related infections in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. The study will determine the relationship between KIR and HLA genes and the following: the risk of HIV infection; HIV levels in the blood; incidence of AIDS; response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); and response to immunotherapy. Approximately 3700 women will participate. Participants will visit the clinic every 6 months for 4 years. An HIV test will be given each time to HIV-negative women. A questionnaire will also be administered. A physical examination and gynecological examination will be given. Blood vaginal swabs and urine will be collected for testing. A biological impedance test will determine any changes in weight waist-to-hip ratios and breast and total body fat. Low CD4 counts and hospitalizations for HIV are to be self-reported to study staff.    ,NCT00339430
HIV,Intermittent Versus Continuous HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) for Treating Chronic HIV Infected Patients in Uganda, Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful in suppressing plasma HIV RNA levels and providing significant clinical benefit in infected patients it does not eradicate HIV infection. It is now clear that virus replication persists despite undetectable plasma viremia in individuals receiving HAART. In this regard withdrawing HAART even after prolonged periods of virus suppression leads almost invariably to a rapid rebound of plasma viremia. It is also now clear that prolonged continuous HAART carries a risk of significant toxicity and side effects. In addition the monetary cost of HAART is prohibitive for many individuals and countries. In terms of cost 95% of the HIV-infected individuals in the world are beyond the reach of therapy as a direct consequence of the cost of therapy. These observations may argue for a different approach to HAART with the goals of: 1) durable suppression of virus replication without an attempt at eradication 2) minimization of toxicity and side effects and improvement in patient life-style and 3) a reduction in cost. Preliminary data from a pilot study conducted at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases USA have demonstrated that short cycle structured intermittent therapy 7 days HAART drug followed by 7 days off HAART has maintained suppression of plasma HIV RNA while preserving CD4+ T cell counts for up to 80 weeks. In addition there was no evidence for increased HIV in reservoir sites; nor was there evidence for the development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs. Finally there was a decrease in parameters of toxicity. This approach may have particular applicability for the treatment of HIV in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore we propose to study the virologic and immunologic effects of short cycle intermittent versus continuous HAART in HIV-infected individuals from the JCRC (Kampala Uganda) in a randomized controlled intent-to-treat trial. We shall evaluate both the 7 days on-HAART/7 days off-HAART as well as a 2 days off-HAART/5 days on-HAART approach. In December 2004 the 7/7 arm was discontinued.    ,NCT00339456

HIV,A Prospective Observational Study of HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and Their Infants at Clinical Sites in Latin American and Caribbean Countries, By the end of 1999 it was estimated that 1.2 million children were living with HIV infection. During 1999 alone 600000 children were newly infected with HIV mostly in less-developed countries. Most HIV-infected children are infected by transmission from mother to child during pregnancy at birth or through breast milk. Antiretroviral medications cesarean section before rupture of membranes and avoidance of breastfeeding are ways to reduce the risk of transmission. This study will determine mother-to-child transmission rates and the effects on infants of exposure to antiretroviral medications and mode of delivery. Approximately 180 to 240 HIV-infected pregnant women in Mexico and Argentina will be enrolled during the first year of this 5-year study. HIV-infected women will be evaluated during pregnancy during delivery and 6 months after delivery. At each visit a history will be taken and physical examination given; blood will be collected for laboratory tests. HIV-exposed infants will be evaluated through 6 months of age. At each of 2 visits a history will be taken and physical examination given; blood will be collected for laboratory tests; and growth will be assessed.    ,NCT00341302
HIV,Validation of System for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients in Africa, This study will evaluate a system for predicting the effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment in African HIV clinics where standard testing methods for measuring viral load such as RNA polymerase chain reaction are not available or affordable. Without accurate tests to monitor viral load treatment decisions often are based on insufficient clinical and immunologic information. This study will see if combined analysis of patients' antiretroviral treatment history adherence to treatment clinical findings and simple laboratory tests can predict whether their treatment is effectively lowering their viral load. An effective monitoring system such as this could reduce the number of patients kept on ineffective treatments for prolonged periods of time as well as reduce the development of drug resistance. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older who are being followed in the Adult Infectious Disease Clinic at Makerere University Kampala Uganda and who have been taking antiretroviral treatment for more than 6 months may be eligible for this study. Participants' medical charts are reviewed and their medical history is taken including questions about their treatment history adherence to treatment and changes in symptoms. A blood sample is drawn to determine viral load CD4+ and CBC counts and if necessary anti-viral resistance.    ,NCT00341393

We hypothesize that in patients with maximal virologic suppression on a double class regimen (including two NRTIs and an NNRTI or a PI boosted with RTV or not) a single drug substitution of didanosine for tenofovir will represent a viable strategy without any negative impact on the virologic efficacy of the regimen.    ,NCT00358696
HIV,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Acyclovir Among HIV and HSV-2 Co-Infected Women Chiang Rai Thailand, Herpes infection is an important co-factor in HIV transmission. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that HSV infection contributed to a 2-fold increased risk of HIV transmission. Suppressive therapy with acyclovir has been a method proposed to reduce HIV transmission. We are conducting a randomized controlled cross-over trial to evaluate the effect of acyclovir suppressive therapy on HIV genital shedding in women co-infected with HIV-1 and Herpes Simplex Virus Type-2 (HSV-2) in Thailand.    ,NCT00362596
HIV,Project RESPECT: The Efficacy of HIV/STD Prevention Counseling," The efficacy of counseling to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has not been definitively shown. This multi-center randomized controlled trial (Project RESPECT) sought to compare the effects of 2 interactive HIV/STD counseling interventions with didactic prevention messages typical of current practice. A total of 5758 STD clinic patients were enrolled from 5 public STD clinics (Baltimore Md; Denver Colo; Long Beach Calif; Newark NJ; and San Francisco Calif) between July 1993 and September 1996. Eligible participants were heterosexual HIV-negative patients aged 14 years or older who came for full STD examinations. Using a block design participating men and women were randomzied separately to 1 of 3 individual face-to-face interventions. Arm 1 received ""enhanced counseling"" consisting of 4 interactive counseling sessions based on the Theory of Reasoned Action and Health Belief Model. Arm 2 received ""brief counseling"" consisting of 2 interactive risk-reduction sessions based on CDC's client-centered counseling model. Arms 3 and 4 each received 2 brief didactic messages about HIV/STD prevention messages typical of current care at that time. Participants assigned to Arms 1 2 and 3 were actively followed up after enrollment with questionnaires at 3 6 9 and 12 months and STD laboratory examinations and tests at 6 and 12 months. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to compare interventions. Arm 4 participants were followed passively to determine potential effects of active study follow-up. The main outcome measures were self-reported condom use and new diagnoses of STDs (gonorrhea chlamydia syphilis HIV) defined by laboratory tests. Results: At the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits self-reported 100% condom use was higher (P<.05) in both the enhanced counseling and brief counseling arms compared with participants in the didactic messages arm. Through the 6-month interval 30% fewer participants had new STDs in both the enhanced counseling (7.2%; P = .002) and brief counseling (7.3%;P=.005) arms compared with those in the didactic messages arm (10.4%). Through the 12-month study 20% fewer participants in each counseling intervention had new STDs compared with those in the didactic messages arm (P = .008). Consistently at each of the 5 study sites STD incidence was lower in the counseling intervention arms than in the didactic messages intervention arm. Reduction of STD was similar for men and women and greater for adolescents and persons with an STD diagnosed at enrollment. Subset analyses found that Based on these results we conclude that short counseling interventions using personalized risk reduction plans can increase condom use and prevent new STDs. Effective counseling can be conducted even in busy public clinics.    ",NCT00362791
HIV,A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Atorvastatin in HIV-Positive Patients Not on Antiretroviral Medications With the Specific Aims of Studying the Effects of Atorvastatin on HIV Viral Load and Immune Activation Markers, This study will examine the effects of atorvastatin a statin (drug that lowers cholesterol) on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). If not treated HIV infection causes an incurable progressive deficiency in the immune system that leads to death usually from disease that takes advantage of weakened immunity. However previous studies have suggested that if the amount of cholesterol in infected cells is reduced multiplication of HIV is also reduced. In this study researchers will examine the HIV viral loads that is amount of the virus in the blood. They will evaluate the composition of the strain of the virus that patients carry (HIV genotype) response of the immune system to the virus and how genes may determine the way in which the drug may or may not work against the strain of virus. Researchers plan to enroll 22 participants anticipating a study to last 30 weeks for each participant. Patients ages 18 or older with HIV infection who are not pregnant or breastfeeding who do not have a known allergy to atorvastatin use and who have not had a serious illness or infection that required hospitalization within the 30 days before entering the study may be eligible for this study. They will be assigned to random groups: one that to receive atorvastatin and the other to receive a placebo which has no effect on cholesterol or ability of the HIV infection to multiply. Patients will remain in their groups and treatments for 8 weeks. At the completion of 8 weeks no matter the study group all patients will be required to discontinue all study-related medications for 4 weeks. After that period the study assignments will be switched so that those previously taking the placebo will take atorvastatin and vice versa. The study will proceed for another 8 weeks followed by a period of stopping study-related medications and patients being observed for 4 weeks. Throughout the study patients will have regularly scheduled visits at the clinic. At those visits there will be collection of blood samples assessments of symptoms physical examinations and questionnaires to complete. Blood tests may require fasting beforehand and blood samples will be used in standard tests including those regarding the liver kidneys muscles blood cells and pregnancy status. Specialized blood tests will determine viral load effects of the drug on the immune cells and genetic influence on the drug's effectiveness.

HIV,Extending HIV Care Beyond the Rural Health Center, The objective of this application is to develop and assess a system which uses non-clinician extenders to provide selected aspects of HIV care in rural western Kenya. The plan is to train persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWAs) to undertake this role as Community Care Coordinators. Our central hypothesis is that PLWAs can be effective members of the health care team and that their involvement in community-based HIV care will facilitate patient access to services and improve outcomes. As such our two specific aims are: 1) To develop a sustainable system to extend HIV care into the community and to train the individuals necessary to support such a system (Community Care Coordinators). 2) To determine the impact of Community Care Coordinators on patient adherence (to drugs and to clinic visits) clinical outcomes (i.e. viral load responses [an individuals level of circulating HIV virus] inter-current opportunistic infections hospitalization drop out from the program change to second line therapy and mortality) and patient perception of stigma. This study will provide invaluable data on the use of non-clinician care extenders for providing HIV care in resource poor settings. As such knowledge gained from this study will assist in developing a model for non-clinician centered HIV care systems elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.    ,NCT00371540
HIV,HIV/AIDS Kaposis Sarcoma: Comparison of Response to HAART vs HAART Plus CXT, Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)is the commonest malignancy associated with HIV/AIDS. Therapy for this cancer which causes substantial morbidity is suboptimal in resource poor settings. The reasons for this are: advanced state of immunosuppression when patients present for clinical care concomitant opportunistic infections non- availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) non-availability and toxicity of chemotherapy (CXT) when available in patients with full blown AIDS prohibitive costs of bone marrow support and fiscal constraints in resource poor settings. A recent Cochrane Review assessed the effectiveness of current therapeutic regimens for HIV KS with a focus on options available in resource poor settings. The major selection criteria for this review were randomized controlled trials for HIV KS in adults. The main conclusions were that data from randomized controlled trials on effective treatments for HIV KS are sparse particularly among people who are also taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Alitretinoin gel is effective for therapy of cutaneous lesions pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is effective for advanced KS and radiotherapy is effective for treating cutaneous lesions. Apart from the randomized trial of radiotherapy no trials applicable to developing settings were identified. Therapy of HIV KS in developing countries thus remains unanswered. The authors concluded that therapies discussed in the review are unlikely to be available or affordable in developing countries where the bulk of HIV infection and KS occur apart from radiotherapy at a few tertiary centers. However recent changes in pricing due to the global alliance and access initiatives mean that HAART is likely to be more available and accessible to developing countries in the near future. South Africa now has committed to this at cabinet level and had a task force to address this issue. HAART has been proposed as therapy for HIV KS on the basis of restoring immune competence and minimizing the HIV tat drive to KS formation. It also improves immunologic control of HHV 8 possibly through interrupting the HIV-1- HHV-8 interaction. There has been only one randomised trial conducted in Spain which compared HAART to the combination of HAART and CXT. There is to date no prospective randomised controlled trial which compares the efficacy of HAART to the standard of care in HIV KS in Africa.    ,NCT00380770
HIV,GRACE: A Study to Compare the Effectiveness Safety and Tolerability of PREZISTA (Darunavir)/Ritonavir by Gender and Race When Administered With Other Antiretroviral Medications in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Positive Women and Men., The purpose of this study is to evaluate any differences in the effectiveness safety and tolerability of PREZISTA (darunavir; DRV) 600 mg administered with ritonavir (RTV) 100 mg twice a day on virologic response (defined as a viral load (VL) of < 50 copies/mL) over a 48-week treatment period in HIV-positive women and men. Additional antiretroviral (ARV) agents will also be administered and will be chosen by the Investigator based on resistance testing and prior treatment history (referred to as the Optimized Background Regimen (OBR)).    ,NCT00381303
HIV,HIV Testing in Pregnant Women: Evaluating an Opt-Out Testing Strategy, Mother-to-child transmission of HIV is an important but preventable mode of infection. Prevention depends on identifying pregnant women infected with HIV and offering medications during pregnancy which can dramatically decrease the chances of transmission. Currently universal screening of all pregnant women for HIV is recommended in the province of Ontario. Unfortunately the rates of screening are still low: estimates place the average rate at 50% -60%. We believe that rates in our clinic at the Women's Health Care Centre are significantly higher in part because all our patients have a first obstetrical visit. This is an unhurried visit with a trained obstetrical nurse who offers pre-test counselling and explores reasons why patients refuse testing. We hypothesize that with this system acceptance rates for HIV screening are significantly higher than the provincial average.    ,NCT00393302

HIV,Accuracy of Hemoglobin A1C to Predict Glycemia in HIV, This study will see if HbA1C the usual blood test for monitoring blood sugar control in diabetic patients is as accurate in diabetic patients who also have HIV and will evaluate if alternative methods for monitoring blood sugar are preferred for HIV infected patients. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes or high blood sugar may be eligible for this study. Participants have two clinic visits (1 to 4 weeks apart) at the NIH Clinical Center. At the first visit they provide a detailed medical social and family history and have blood and urine samples collected. Previous blood sugar values are also recorded. At the second visit scheduled for 1 to 4 weeks after the first visit blood and urine samples are collected. Some of the urine and blood samples are stored for future research on diabetes HIV or related conditions.    ,NCT00433628

HIV,Occurrence of Pneumocystis Pneumonia in HIV-Infected Patients and the Interference of the HAART, From the beginning of the AIDS epidemic pulmonary pneumocystosis (PCP) has been distinguished as one of the most frequent opportunistic diseases with high morbid-mortality. As from 1996 the advent of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has changed the characteristics of such epidemic by reducing its related diseases and as a result AIDS-related mortality. With the purpose to estimate PCP occurrence and HAART interference 376 HIV-infected or AIDS patients were studied from January 1992 to December 2002.    ,NCT00516581
HIV,Evaluation and Monitoring of Patients With HIV Infectionn, This study is designed to learn more about HIV infection and the conditions associated with it. Patients 18 years of age or older with known or suspected HIV infection may be eligible for this study. Patients may have participated in previous NIH studies. Participants will have periodic physical examinations and blood tests including evaluations for responses to treatment. Treatment consistent with accepted standard medical practice will be individualized for each patient. Patients who previously participated in a NIH study will be followed for possible long-term benefits or side effects of treatment. Patients treated with alpha-interferon or interleukin-2 (IL-2) may continue treatment with that medication if it is felt that they might benefit from it. Blood samples may be drawn as part of standard medical care and for research purposes. Other tests may be done as appropriate for diagnosis and treatment including for example a chest X-ray electrocardiogram or tissue biopsy. Patients will be seen for follow-up visits at regular intervals to monitor treatment progress. Certain patients currently enrolled in a NIH study of IL-2 treatment may participate in a phase of the study that adds a corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone prednisone or prednisonolone to the regimen. Patients whose CD4 counts did not increase with IL-2 will receive corticosteroids (by mouth or by vein) in an open manner. Patients who responded to IL-2 therapy will be randomly assigned to receive corticosteroids or a placebo (inactive substance) during IL-2 infusions in a blinded manner so that neither the patient nor the medical staff will know which patients are receiving the drug and which are receiving a placebo. Participants will be requested to receive at least three rounds of treatment with corticosteroid or placebo. Patients currently taking IL-2 by subcutaneous injection (under the skin) may participate in an optional part of the study to receive future IL-2 cycles at home instead of at or near the Clinical Center. Patients who have shown an ability to self-administer and tolerate IL-2 injections with minimal supervision and minimal side effects may be eligible for this option. Home administration of IL-2 involves less frequent data and safety monitoring and no on-site medical evaluation at the very beginning of each cycle. Participants will continue to be seen at the Clinical Center for regularly scheduled follow-up visits and medical evaluations before the start of each IL-2 cycle to determine if it is safe to begin that cycle. Patients will have a case manager who will place monitoring calls on days 2 and 4 of the cycle and a third follow-up call 1 week later. Patients will be responsible for contacting a study staff member if complications of other problems develop at other times.    ,NCT00557570

HIV,Efficacy of Influenza Vaccine in HIV Infected Adults, Vaccination of HIV infected individuals with the sub-unit influenza vaccine is safe; however it induces only moderate immune responses and likewise is modest in its protection compared to HIV uninfected individuals. Based upon the available data the South African Thoracic Society has provisionally recommended the use of influenza vaccine in HIV infected individuals with CD4+ counts of > 200/ml and viral loads of < 100 000 copies/ml.(Green R et al. In press SAMJ). This proposal is however based upon recommendations made elsewhere with minimal level of evidence regarding its benefit and no evidence from countries with a high prevalence of HIV. Very few HIV infected adults however actually do receive influenza vaccine in South Africa partly because of the absence of compelling data regarding the burden of disease in Africa as well as lack of vaccine effectiveness and issues related to physician awareness and access to influenza vaccine in the public immunization program. The conflicting evidence between developed countries and Africa regarding the effectiveness of PPV highlight the drawbacks of extrapolating vaccine effectiveness data from developed countries to developing countries. Differences in the epidemiology of HIV between developed countries in which the prevalence of HIV is low to that of high-burden sub-Saharan African countries include:   -  differences in the mode of transmission of HIV and demographics of the infected population.   -  differences in standard of care including access to prophylaxis against opportunistic infections and use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)   -  differences in risk for disease from opportunistic pathogens e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis etc. These differences may all contribute to differences in the risk and severity of influenza illness among HIV infected adults from these communities as well as possibly responsiveness and effectiveness of vaccination. The investigators are conducting a double-blinded placebo controlled randomized trial at the HIV treatment clinic at Helen Joseph Hospital to determine the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in HIV infected adults in South Africa. The significance of the findings from this study will help quantify the burden of influenza illness in African HIV infected adults as well as assist in making more informed recommendations for the use of influenza vaccine in HIV infected adults and in guiding national policy for preparing for a future influenza virus-pandemic.    ,NCT00757900

HIV,A Pilot Study to Characterize the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir in the Cervicovaginal Fluids of HIV-infected Women, The purpose of this research sub-study is to learn about the levels of an antiretroviral (ARV) medication called Raltegravir and response to HIV virus in the genital tract of HIV-positive women. We would like to see how this study medication is tolerated and how the body processes the study medication in women who are HIV-positive. More specifically we are interested in how Isentress® might penetrate into the female cervicovaginal secretions thereby potentially reducing the amount of HIV in those secretions. A reduction in the amount of HIV in genital secretions may prevent female subjects from transmitting HIV to their sexual partners. This information will help the research team know how a medication such as Isentress® might be used to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV.    ,NCT00774683
HIV,Blood Markers of Inflammation Blood Clotting and Blood Vessel Function in HIV-infected Adults, This study will collect information about markers of inflammation blood clotting and blood vessel function in HIV-infected adults and healthy volunteers. Biomarkers are biological indicators that have been associated with disease. Certain markers of inflammation blood clotting and blood vessel function have been associated with risk of cardiovascular disease stroke and death. One marker called D-dimer is a breakdown product of blood clots that has been associated with serious medical conditions including deep vein thrombosis (formation of a blood clot in a vein deep in the body) and pulmonary embolism (blockage in the pulmonary artery that occurs when a blood clot from a vein breaks away travels to the pulmonary artery and lodges there). High D-dimer levels have also been associated with cardiovascular disease and stroke risk. In a recent study of HIV-infected patients higher D-dimer levels were strongly correlated with risk of death from any cause. The significance of changes in D-dimer and other biomarkers in HIV-infected adults is not well understood. This study will further explore D-dimer and other biomarkers to try to better understand the relationships between them and HIV infection. Healthy volunteers and HIV-infected adults 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Two visits are involved as follows: Visit 1 (screening visit to determine eligibility)   -  Medical history and physical examination.   -  Blood tests for HIV infection blood counts liver and kidney function.   -  Pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant. Visit 2   -  Blood tests for hepatitis B and C   -  Blood tests for markers of inflammation and blood clotting.   -  Blood test for genetic changes that influence blood clotting. In some cases visits 1 and 2 may be combined. Optional additional visits (up to 8 visits over 3 years)   -  Additional blood draws for investigation of specific clinical or laboratory findings may be requested.    ,NCT00776412

HIV,Transitions: Linkages From Jail To Community, TRANSITIONS a novel jail-release program for People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) will use evidence-based interventions and adapt them to create a comprehensive transitional program in Waterbury and New Haven County Connecticut. Evidence-based interventions will include but not be limited to enhanced rapid HIV testing within the New Haven Community Correctional Center (NHCCC local jail) intensive case management continuity of buprenorphine treatment from the jail to the community setting and a novel Money Management (MM) program. The HIV in Prisons Program and the Community Health Care Van (CHCV) at the Yale University AIDS Program in collaboration with the Connecticut Department of Correction and the Waterbury Hospital Infectious Diseases Clinic propose to expand the availability of opiate substitution treatment and to enhance clinical and social services for PLWHA who are transitioning from the jail to the community setting. As part of Transitions we will develop a model Money Management program that we have used in community settings to improve health outcomes for socially and medically marginalized populations and adapt it for a jail-release program. The Transitions program will incorporate these elements into a combined intervention and will result in a clinical trial to compare the additional contribution of a money management program.    ,NCT00841711
HIV,Autologous T-Cells Genetically Modified at the CCR5 Gene by Zinc Finger Nucleases SB-728 for HIV," This research study is being carried out to study a new way to possibly treat HIV. This agent is called a ""Zinc Finger Nuclease"" or ZFN for short. ZFNs are proteins that can delete another protein named CCR5. This CCR5 protein is required for certain common types of HIV (CCR5 tropic) to enter into and infect T-cells. T-cells are one of the white blood cells used by the body to fight HIV. The most important T-cells are those called ""CD4 T-cells."" Some people are born without CCR5 on their T-cells. These people remain healthy and are resistant to infection with HIV. Other people have a low number of CCR5 on their T-cells and their HIV disease is less severe and is slower to cause disease (AIDS). In order to delete the CCR5 protein on the T cells this study will isolate large numbers of T-cells from subjects and then deliver the ZFNs using a delivery vehicle called a viral vector. The viral vector used in this study is called an adenoviral vector. The vector is added to the cells at the beginning of the manufacture process and the ZFNs knock out the CCR5 protein. By the time T-cells are returned to subjects there is minimal adenovirus or ZFN present. The removal of the CCR5 protein on the T-cells subjects receive however is permanent. The purpose of this research study is to find out whether ""zinc finger"" modified T-cells are   1. safe to give to humans and   2. find how ""zinc finger"" modified T cell affects HIV This is an experimental study. Laboratory studies have shown that when CD4 T-cells are modified with ""zinc fingers"" HIV is prevented from killing the CD4 T cells. On the basis of these laboratory results there is the potential that ""zinc fingers"" may work in humans infected with HIV and improve their immune system by allowing their CD4 T-cells to survive longer (HIV usually kills T cells it infects). All subjects who receive ZFN Modified CD4+T cells will enroll in a Long Term Follow-up study to monitor subjects. Subjects will be followed every 3 months for four years. If the ZFN Modified CD4+T cells are no longer found in the blood after four years then subjects will be contacted yearly for the next 6 years. If the ZFN Modified CD4+T cells are found in the blood at year four then the subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the ZFN Modified CD4+T cells are no longer found in the blood for a maximum of 10 years.

HIV,Changes in Lipids and Safety of Raltegravir in HIV+ Patients With Hyperlipidemia While on Current Standard Therapy, The success of combination antiretroviral therapy heralded a revolution in the treatment of HIV in the mid-1990s. However severe treatment-associated side effects have been observed including diabetes and increased cholesterol which are linked to premature heart attacks. This effect has been described among many regimens containing protease inhibitors (PIs) as well as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Raltegravir is a new medicine which has been shown to be potent and efficacious in suppression of the HIV. This study hopes to determine if switching from a PI or NNRTI to raltegravir will decrease cholesterol in subjects with high cholesterol and well controlled HIV. In addition the study aims to confirm that raltegravir is safe and well tolerated. It also seeks to confirm if raltegravir will have similar anti-HIV activity compared with the patient's previous regimen. The study will last 6 months and will involve 20 subjects. HIV-1 infected men and women on PIs or NNRTIs for at least 12 months before study entry with well controlled HIV will be recruited. Hypotheses:   1. Patients with elevated lipid levels while on combination antiretroviral therapy with PIs or NNRTIs will experience an improvement in lipid levels after switching their PI or NNRTI to a raltegravir based regimen.   2. Raltegravir will be safe and well tolerated.   3. Raltegravir will have similar antiretroviral activity compared with the prior regimen. Primary Objective: To demonstrate an improvement in lipid profile (triglycerides or LDL) in subjects switched to raltegravir from PIs or NNRTIs at 2 3 and 6 months after study entry. Study Design: Subjects will be given the option to switch from their current regimen to raltegravir at 400mg twice daily. Those who consent will receive raltegravir provided by the study for 6 months. At entry the subjects will undergo a complete physical exam and thereafter targeted exams at each visit. Labs will be drawn as part of clinical care at 2 3 and 6 months. Some of the blood will be stored for later analysis. Also the subjects will answer regular surveys on drug toxicity and quality of life. Their cholesterol level will be compared before and after the study. At the end of the study the participants may choose to continue on raltegravir if they desire.    ,NCT00887653
HIV,Cognitive and Psychosocial Benefits of MISC Training for Ugandan Children, The Mediational Interventions for Sensitizing Caregivers (MISC) model developed by Professor Pnina Klein is to enhance the cognitive and social development of children throughout the developing world . Although MISC has proven effective in a longitudinal study in two poorer communities of Addis Ababa Ethiopia  it has not been used with HIV households or in the Ugandan context where there is desperate need for enhanced caregiving in HIV-affected families. We propose to work with community leaders healthcare workers and parents/caregivers in adapting MISC to the Ugandan cultural and social context in Kayunga. For intervention families MISC training will be added to an ongoing home health care visit (HHCV) program already in place for HIV children in Kayunga district. We will then evaluate whether MISC parent/caregiver training improves cognitive and psychosocial development in their children and whether clinical stability of the HIV child is an important modifier for MISC training benefit.    ,NCT00889395

HIV,Effect of Extra Virgin Olive Oil on Atherosclerosis Biomarkers in HIV-infected Patients, HIV infection is associated with systemic inflammation that is involved in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Treatment of HIV infection may cause lipid profile disturbance and consequently atherosclerosis progression. In general extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has beneficial effect on atherosclerosis markers. Our goals are to examine the effect of EVOO on atherosclerosis markers in HIV-treated patients. A controlled randomized cross-over study will be performed on 40 participants. They will consume EVOO and ROO (refined olive oil) during two 20 days intervention periods interrupted with 14 days wash-out period. Before the trial and after both intervention periods we will analyze participants' blood for: ESR white blood cell count hsCRP interleukin-6 oxidized LDL glutathione peroxidase superoxide dismutase malondialdehyde triglycerides total cholesterol HDL and LDL cholesterol fibrinogen factor VII and von Willebrand factor. We expect an improvement of these parameters after three weeks of EVOO consumption.    ,NCT00925795
HIV,Evaluation of Three Strategies of Second-line Antiretroviral Treatment in Africa (Dakar - Bobo-Dioulasso - Yaoundé), Since the first line antiretroviral (ARV) treatment is now largely accessible in the Sub-Saharian Africa countries documentation of virological failure drug resistance patterns and second line treatment evaluation are still to be consolidated in settings where viral load monitoring is not available and non-B HIV subtype is predominant. This trial aims at evaluating the efficacy and tolerance of 3 different second line treatment strategies: two recommended by WHO combine two non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor associated with a ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor (emtricitabine-tenofovir-lopinavir/ritonavir and abacavir-didanosine-lopinavir/ritonavir); the third strategy combines emtricitabine-tenofovir-darunavir/ritonavir and is not yet evaluated in Sub-Saharian Africa. Darunavir has a potentially superior antiviral efficacy a better tolerance and its single daily administration may facilitate treatment adherence.    ,NCT00928187
HIV,HIV Viral Load Monitoring in Resource-Poor Settings, No randomized clinical trial to date has demonstrated a survival benefit of using regular HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load (VL) testing to monitor patients' responses to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection. The measurement of VL is recommended to monitor the response to ART in developed countries. In resource-constrained settings the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend routine VL testing in part due to the cost and complex infrastructure needed for reliable results. In these settings WHO has proposed the use of clinical and CD4+ lymphocyte-based criteria to guide treatment decisions. However multiple studies have demonstrated the poor performance of these criteria in sub-Saharan Africa and the frequent discordance between immunologic and virologic responses to ART. The use of routine viral load monitoring should be evaluated in resource-constrained settings. The investigators hypothesize that routine viral load testing of patients on ART will improve patient survival decrease disease progression and development of drug resistance and will be feasible and cost-effective for resource-constrained settings.    ,NCT00929604
HIV,BATAR: Individuals Currently Taking Boosted Atazanavir as Part of an HIV Treatment Regimen Will be Evaluated to See if Substituting Raltegravir for Nucleoside Transcriptase Inhibitors Will be Safe and Well Tolerated., The purpose of this Phase IV pilot study is to evaluate the safety tolerability and satisfaction of a nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)sparing regimen for participants fully suppressed on an atazanavir/ritonavir based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)regimen plus emtricitabine/tenofovir (Truvada). Several pharmacologic factors support this concept including the favorable drug interaction between atazanavir and raltegravir. Participants will be randomized to either continue on their current regimen or one of two study arms (atazanavir 300mg plus ritonavir 100mg daily plus raltegravir 400mg twice daily or atazanavir 300mg twice daily plus raltegravir 400mg twice daily). Participants will be followed for 48 weeks for safety tolerability and satisfaction. After baseline the participants will have six clinic visits for evaluation and labs.    ,NCT00931801
HIV,Drug Interaction Study Between Inhaled Beclomethasone and Protease Inhibitors in Healthy Volunteers, Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and respiratory disease commonly require protease inhibitors (PIs) and orally inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids alone do not generally cause systemic adverse effects because of low systemic bioavailability but the combination of inhaled fluticasone and various PIs has led to increased systemic fluticasone levels and multiple cases of secondary adrenal insufficiency. A study in healthy volunteers showed > 350-fold increase in fluticasone area under the curve when ritonavir (RTV) 100mg twice daily was coadministered with intranasal fluticasone compared to intranasal fluticasone alone. The mechanism of this drug interaction is presumably secondary to PI inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 the enzyme responsible for fluticasone metabolism. As a result inhaled fluticasone is not recommended in combination with most PIs unless the benefit outweighs the risk. One possible alternative to fluticasone is inhaled beclomethasone which has not been studied in combination with PIs. Although beclomethasone also undergoes metabolism via CYP3A4 in vitro to its more active metabolite beclomethasone-17-monopropionate it appears to be largely hydrolyzed by esterases in vivo. Furthermore the pharmacokinetic properties of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate such as relatively short half-life low maximum plasma concentration and low volume of distribution suggest that systemic accumulation leading to significant adverse effects is unlikely even in the presence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as a PI. In this open-label study 46 subjects will receive inhaled beclomethasone for 6 weeks from Days 1 to 42. Subjects will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups such that from Days 15 to 42 18 subjects will add no additional study drugs 14 subjects will add RTV 100mg twice daily and 14 subjects will add DRV/r 600/100mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic sampling for beclomethasone and beclomethasone-17-monopropionate levels will occur on Days 14 and 28. Pre-cosyntropin cortisol levels and a low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test will be performed on all subjects on Days 1 14 28 and 42. Data from this investigation will determine whether RTV and/or DRV/r potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors alter the pharmacokinetics of beclomethasone and its active metabolite beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (primary objective) and whether or not a possible increase in systemic bioavailability of beclomethasone and beclomethasone-17-monopropionate alters pre-cosyntropin cortisol levels and responses to ACTH stimulation test over a 4-week period (secondary objective). Results from this investigation will provide pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to assist clinicians in determining whether inhaled beclomethasone is an appropriate option in HIV-infected patients requiring concomitant therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid and PIs.    ,NCT00936793

HIV,Evaluation of Effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Care on the Adherence of HIV-Positive Patients to Antiretroviral Therapy, INTRODUCTION: Studies prove that the pharmaceutical care (PC) increases the adherence to the antiretroviral; thus they increase the undetectable viral load. The viral load diminishes and the prevalence of undetectable viral load increases as the levels of adherence to the treatment increase being in general necessary high adhesion to reach the effectiveness therapeutic. Increasing the adherence levels it increases the surviving chances and quality of life and diminishes the transmission risks. Studies demonstrate that the self-effectiveness expectation to use the medication correctly is the main predictor of adherence and that the more complex the therapeutic regimen is and the perception of side effects the smaller the adherence is highlighting the importance of preventing identifying and solving the problems during the treatment with antiretroviral problems related to the medication (PRM) through the PC. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of the PC on the adherence of HIV-patients to the antiretroviral therapy identify prevent and solve PRMs during the treatment. METHODOLOGY: One-side randomized clinical trail controlled by non-intervention in parallel. 332 patients randomized are included in the control and intervention groups (PC). Questionnaires will be applied: sociodemographic adherence to the antiretroviral through self-report smoke BECK (depression) CAGE (problems related with alcohol consumption) of self-effectiveness expectation of results and social support. Each 4 months measure of viral load and CD4 will be carried out. The ones from the PC group will receive a card with information about the medication and all the medicines will be identified by different colors. The follow-up will last one year according to the instructions of DADER program.    ,NCT00959361
HIV,Switch From Combivir or Trizivir to Truvada - Mitochondrial Effects, Study subjects receiving the antiretroviral drugs Combivir or trizivir will be randomized to switch to Truvada-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or to continue on Combivir or on trizivir. Measurements will be performed at baseline and after 6 months after randomization to either continuing on trizivir or combivir or to switching to Truvada. Measurements include maximal or peak oxygen consumption lactate production and clearance subcutaneous adipose tissue and limb fat contents insulin resistance liver and muscle fat contents and plasma free fatty acid concentrations. The hypothesis underlying this study is that chronic therapy with thymidine analogue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) including zidovudine (AZT) leads to clinically detectable mitochondrial dysfunction in several organ systems.    ,NCT00960622

HIV,HIV Persistence and Viral Reservoirs," Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) decreases HIV-associated mortality it does not to completely restore health. Patients doing well on otherwise effective HAART remain at risk for cancer cardiovascular/liver disease osteopenia and other ""non-AIDS-defining"" events. While complete eradication may never be feasible a ""functional cure"" in which patients are able to maintain undetectable viral loads indefinitely without therapy may be possible. The best evidence for this are the so-called ""elite"" controllers whom we define as individuals who are HIV-seropositive with plasma HIV RNA levels below the level of conventional detection without treatment. Controllers may be conceptualized as a naturally occurring model of a functional cure (or ""HIV remission"") and are ideal patients in which to study HIV persistence and the possibility of eradication. We propose to conduct a pilot study to better characterize the reservoirs that lead to viral persistence in a group of well-characterized controllers. We propose two specific aims: 1) to characterize the dynamics of viral production in blood and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in controllers; and 2) to prospectively treat 10 controllers with raltegravir tenofovir/emtricitabine for 24 weeks and study the effects of HAART on viral dynamics and host inflammatory responses. Our primary hypotheses are: 1) viral replication is ongoing in untreated controllers 2) HAART will reduce viral replication in blood and GALT and decrease immune activation and 3) higher levels of immune activation are associated with greater measures of microbial translocation and distribution of virus to more differentiated T cell subsets.

HIV,Contingency Management in the Delivery of HAART to Drug Users in Chennai India, Drug use (DU) is a major risk factor for HIV infection in many regions of the world. However as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been rolled out in South and South East Asia less than 2% of individuals initiated on HAART were drug users (DUs) or former DUs despite the fact that approximately 20% of HIV infections in the region are ascribed to DU. India is home to about 2.4 million HIV-infected individuals. Though injection drug users contribute to only about 3% of all HIV infections in India; it is estimated that there are between 168000 and 1.1 million DUs in India with HIV prevalence about 30%. Novel approaches are needed to engage disenfranchised populations in HIV care in lower and middle income countries where the burden of HIV disease is growing. Incentive-based strategies (or contingency management) have been shown to be effective in reducing illicit drug use smoking cessation and weight loss. Short-term pilot studies have also shown that incentive-based strategies can improve electronically-monitored rates of adherence to HAART in the US and a recent study in Africa showed that a small incentive approximately doubled the rate that individuals returned to learn the results of their HIV test. However to date there is no experience with the use of incentive-based interventions to improve engagement into care and risk-reduction among out-of-care HIV-infected DUs in developing world settings. The investigators propose to conduct pilot randomized trial comparing a voucher incentive strategy to a control condition to improve engagement in HIV care and HIV treatment outcomes among out-of-care treatment-eligible HIV-infected DUs in Chennai India. Subjects in the incentive arm will be eligible to earn incentive vouchers for 1) initiating HAART at a government-sanctioned HIV treatment clinic 2) adherence to scheduled follow-up visits at the HIV clinic and 3) achieving suppression of HIV RNA. Subjects will be enrolled from a mature research venue in Chennai YR Gaitonde Centre for Substance Abuse-related Research (YRGCSAR) which focuses the epidemiology and natural history of HIV in DUs. Preliminary data from this pilot study will be used to inform the design of a phase-III study.    ,NCT01031745

The investigators hypotheses include:   1. In raltegravir arm compared with nevirapine arm fewer patients will require methadone dose adjustment to abate methadone withdrawal symptoms. Also the average methadone dose to achieve adequate serum methadone concentrations in patients on the raltegravir-based regimen will be lower compared to that of patients on the nevirapine-based regimen.   2. Clinical outcomes in terms of viral suppression CD4 recovery and occurrence of opportunistic infections will be comparable in the two arms at 6 months and one year.   3. Patients in the raltegravir arm will have a similar or better side effect profile retention rate and treatment adherence compared to those in the nevirapine arm.    ,NCT01042652

HIV,Preventative Misconception Intervention," This study will carry out a preliminary ""proof of concept"" to evaluate two types of supplemental information that would serve as an adjunct to the traditional informed consent in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) vaccine clinical trial. These will be compared to the condition where the traditional informed consent form is used alone. Using four intervention sites participants will be administered a standard HIV vaccine trial consent form. They will then be randomized into three conditions: 1) No supplemental information; 2) Supplemental information with 1-sided messages (emphasizes information content related to vaccine trial randomization and unproven efficacy of vaccine); and 3) Supplemental information with 2-sided messages (acknowledges the beliefs that are at odds with the information content and seeks to neutralize those beliefs through counter-argument). An interviewer-administered questionnaire (IAQ) Part 1 will be administered before the traditional HIV vaccine trial informed consent is reviewed with the participant. An IAQ Part 2 will be administered directly after the HIV vaccine trial informed consent in the control condition or after reading through the supplemental material. Debriefing interviews will be conducted with selected participants to review their understanding of the study procedures and their reactions to the supplemental materials and/or questionnaires. The proposed research is a ""proof of concept"" study and is therefore not designed to test hypotheses. Consequently formal hypothesis and related power calculations to detect certain effect sizes are not required. Instead the goal will be to enroll an appropriate number of subjects for purpose of determining the feasibility of developing a larger study of supplemental information to be used as an adjunct to the informed consent statement in HIV vaccine clinical trials and providing related descriptive statistics.

HIV,Treatment for Depression Among HIV-Infected Youth, This is a two-phase study that is designed to test a novel behavioral intervention to treat depression in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) adolescents and young adults. Four Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) sites will be assigned to either the Combination Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Medication Management (COMB) treatment group or the Treatment as Usual (TAU) group. Phase I involves pilot testing of a 24-week intervention consisting of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Medication Management (MM) manuals at sites assigned to the COMB treatment group. Participants enrolled at TAU sites will receive treatment for depression that is typical at that site which may include medication management psychosocial therapy or a combination of the two. Psychopharmacological and psychosocial interventions will not be standardized and participants may receive any depression treatment recommended by the site clinicians while on study. Study coordinators and site clinicians regardless of group assignment will document depression symptoms and treatment regimens for all participants for 24 weeks. In addition site staff and participants at COMB sites will participate in an exit interview. The findings from these interviews will be used to revise both CBT and MM intervention manuals at the end of Phase I. Phase II is a feasibility study of the revised CBT and MM manuals. Phase II involves similar procedures as Phase I; sites assigned to COMB will implement the revised CBT and MM manuals. Participants at TAU sites will receive treatment for depression that is typical at that site. As in Phase I psychopharmacological and psychosocial interventions will not be standardized and participants may receive any depression treatment recommended by the site clinicians while on study. Depression symptoms and treatment regimens for all participants will be documented for 24 weeks. Additionally all Phase II participants will have 2 follow-up visits at weeks 36 and 48. Again site staff and participants at COMB sites will participate in an exit interview.

HIV,Clinical Study of an Aluvia-based HAART Regimen for Prevention of Mother-to-child HIV Transmission in Africa, Therapeutic options to prevent vertical transmission of HIV remain limited. Combination antiretroviral therapy in the form of HAART (Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy) is generally recommended in the developed world both for its ability to reduce maternal viral load and thus the likelihood of transmission as well as for its prevention of drug resistance mutations which might otherwise reduce future options for therapy in the mother infant or both. Exclusive formula-feeding is also recommended in the developed world (where clean water sources & adequate hygiene is reliably available) to prevent HIV transmission through breastmilk however this is not yet a feasible option in many developing world settings due to economic infrastructure social and infant-health reasons. The investigators propose use of a HAART regimen during pregnancy and breastfeeding that is based upon the recently released Aluvia tablets (tablet form of LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR or LOP; established capsule form is known as Kaletra) to improve maternal virological control and thus mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT). Hypothesis: Maternal use of HAART containing Zidovudine 3TC and Aluvia (Lopinavir/Ritonavir) can prevent antepartum and intrapartum transmission of HIV as well as allow exclusive and then subsequent complementary feeding to be carried out with minimum risk to the mother and infant.   -  Study regimen: ZDV/3TC (combivir) + 2 Aluvia Tabs all PO BID to start at 14-30 weeks gestational age (GA) and continue through labor and as long as the mother breastfeeds   -  Peripartum single dose Nevirapine (sdNVP) (Note: Mothers will also be receiving ZDV as part of the study regimen) to mother and sdNVP + 5 days postpartum ZDV to the infant will be given as per current Zambian practice   -  Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) x 6 months then complementary foods to be added with aim for a gradual wean of breastfeeding by infant age of 12-13 months. In case of inability to wean by 13 months however drug will be continued until the mother has achieved a complete wean.   -  Follow-up period: Mother & child will be followed to an infant age of 24 months as per schedule-of-visits (approx every 3 months) Major outcome measure: infant survival and negative dbs (dried blood spot) PCR 3 months post weaning.    ,NCT01088516

HIV,HIV Testing in Non-traditional Settings Study, Surveillance data suggests that approximately one third of the 82 000 HIV infected adults in the UK remain undiagnosed - that is they are living with the infection but do not know this. The majority of HIV testing in the UK to date has taken place in sexual health clinics and in antenatal care. Published National guidelines advocate routine HIV testing of 16-65 year olds in more general healthcare settings in parts of the country with relatively high rates of HIV (more than 2 per thousand individuals diagnosed locally). The HINTS Study investigates the utility feasibility and acceptability to patients and staff of offering routine HIV testing in four general medical settings all set in areas of high HIV prevalence. The settings comprise: Primary Care Outpatients an Acute Care Unit and an Emergency Department.    ,NCT01138878
HIV,The Influence of Ritonavir Alone and in Combination With Lopinavir on Fenofibric Acid Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Volunteers, Background: - Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are often treated with protease inhibitors that help fight HIV infection. However these medications often increase blood cholesterol levels particularly triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins and can lead to heart disease and other problems. Patients may take drugs known as fibrates (such as gemfibrozil (Lopid )) to lower triglyceride levels but even with maximum approved doses patients often cannot reach goal triglyceride levels. Research suggests that fibrates and certain HIV medications such as ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir may interact and decrease the effectiveness of the fibrate treatment. More research is needed to determine the best drug to lower triglyceride levels in HIV patients who are receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Objectives: - To evaluate the drug-drug interaction between fenofibrate and protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and ritonavir. Eligibility: - Healthy individuals between 18 and 60 years of age. Design:   -  This study will require a screening visit and 18 study visits. The screening visit will take 3 to 4 hours and can occur 7 to 30 days before starting the study. The rest of the study not including the screening visit is 48 days. Three of the visits will take about 12 hours and the remaining 15 visits will take about 1 hour.   -  For study days 1 to 7 participants will take fenofibrate alone. Participants will keep a daily record of medication doses and any side effects.   -  For study days 8 to 27 participants will take fenofibrate and ritonavir. Participants will keep a daily record of medication doses and any side effects.   -  For study days 29 to 48 participants will take fenofibrate and lopinavir/ritonavir. Participants will keep a daily record of medication doses and any side effects.   -  Participants will have regular study visits to provide blood samples for research and monitoring....    ,NCT01148004
HIV,Multicentre Study To Assess Changes In Bone Mineral Density Of The Switch From Tenofovir To Abacavir In Hiv-1-Infected Subjects With Loss Of Bone Mineral Density, Most of studies have not found any consistent drug-specific association with bone loss and controversial data with respect the effect of protease inhibitors (PIs) have been published. The more evident finding with respect to this issue is the more pronounced decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) in patients during the first weeks of receiving a tenofovir (TDF)-containing regimen probably by the effect of TDF on phosphorus balance and vitamin D metabolism.    ,NCT01153217
Hiv,Behavioral Activation/Armodafinil to Treat Fatigue in HIV/AIDS, This is an integrated medication/behavioral intervention program to increase energy activity level and goal attainment in a sample of HIV+ adults whose presenting problems include both clinically significant fatigue and unmet vocational goals. Based on previous studies the investigators found that many patients fail to achieve desired goals even though energy is restored by medication. To address this failure of goal attainment the investigators will evaluate a behavioral intervention originally based on Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression and modified as Behavioral Activation Program for Energy and Productivity or BA-PEP. The intervention will be conducted with patients who experience clinically significant fatigue and who want to work or receive work-related training (paid or volunteer part time or full time) or education once energy improves with medication (armodafinil).    ,NCT01158443

HIV,A Semi-Factorial Cluster-Randomized Trial to Estimate the Effect Size of Community Mobilization and VCT Vans on the Adoption of Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) Services in Andhra Pradesh India: THE MCVCT STUDY, With an estimated 2.5 million HIV-infected persons India is home to one of the largest populations of HIV-infected persons in the world. Yet it is estimated that less than 20% of the people living with HIV in India are aware of their status. Andhra Pradesh (AP) situated in south India is the state with the highest HIV burden in India. Reports from AP suggest usage of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) is low especially among high-risk groups. VCT has been shown to have many benefits in addition to diagnosis of HIV infection such as reduction in risk behavior partner referral and serving as an entry point to the health care system. Community mobilization and VCT vans have been shown in the past to play a role in increasing utilization of VCT services in various developing countries similar to India. The primary objective of this protocol is to arrive at an effect size of community mobilization alone and both community mobilization and VCT vans on the adoption of VCT services in Andhra Pradesh India. Secondary objectives include identifying barriers to VCT assessing stigma in the community and establishing a specimen repository at the YRGCARE infectious disease laboratory in Chennai India. We will achieve these objectives by conducting a cluster randomized clinical trial with 3 arms: ARM 1: standard of care with pre-existing VCT centers (SVCT); ARM 2: community mobilization in the setting of pre-existing VCT centers (CVCT); ARM 3: community mobilization plus VCT van in addition to the pre-existing VCT centers (MCVCT). The overall study duration will be 6 months from randomization. To our knowledge this is the first study to examine the role of community mobilization and VCT vans on the adoption of VCT in the Indian context. It will provide us with vital data that will be used to plan a larger powered study to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions including sites from other parts of India. Additionally this study will also provide us with important information on barriers to VCT in these communities.    ,NCT01160575
HIV,The Use of Leukapheresis to Support HIV Pathogenesis Studies," Despite the dramatic improvements that have resulted from combination antiretroviral treatment long-term efficacy toxicity cost and the requirements for life-long adherence remain as formidable challenges. Also there is emerging consensus that persistent HIV-associated disease occurs during long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This disease may be due to either direct drug-toxicity and/or persistent viral replication/production and/or persistent HIV-associated inflammation. Hence strategies aimed at achieving complete viral eradication may be needed in order to fully restore health among HIV infected individuals. Even if complete eradication proves impossible?as most believe to be the case?a less rigorous but still desirable outcome might be achieving durable control of virus in the absence of therapy. That a ""functional"" cure is possible is well illustrated by those rare individuals who are able to durably control replication competent virus in the absence of therapy (""elite"" controllers). A more complete understanding of the relationship between inflammation and viral persistence is necessary before more rationale studies of HIV eradication can be designed. Also a well validated high through-put virologic assay needs to be developed that can estimate the size of the latent reservoir. Since the level of replication competent virus in long-term treated patients (and in elite controllers) is very small (< 1% of CD4 cells harbor HIV) large numbers of CD4+ T cells most be obtained from study participants in order to routinely isolate and quantify virus persistence.

HIV,Home Self-Testing for HIV to Increase HIV Testing Frequency in Men Who Have Sex With Men (The iTest Study), The purpose of this study is to determine whether the availability of home self-testing for HIV will increase HIV testing frequency among men who have sex with men without negatively impacting their risk for HIV acquisition.    ,NCT01161446
HIV,A Phase II/III Trial of Lopinavir/Ritonavir Dosed According to the WHO Pediatric Weight Band Dosing Guidelines, Treatment of children and infants with HIV requires modification of medication dosing according to a child's specific weight. For lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) a second line treatment option that is increasingly necessary due to infant drug resistance this dosing is often complicated and impractical in busy clinical settings. To address this the World Health Organization (WHO) has released a simplified dosing table based on infant weight bands. This study will evaluate the absorption safety and tolerance of LPV/r in infants when dosed according to the new WHO guidelines.    ,NCT01172535
HIV,HIV/AIDS Severe Mental Illness and Homelessness, This is a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) for 308 seriously mentally ill adults (SMI) engaging in risky sexual and/or drug use behavior comparing a brief HIV primary and secondary prevention intervention [Skills building and Motivational Interviewing (SB-MI) to Care as Usual (CAU)]. The study setting is a large urban safety net Medical Center and outcomes will be measured at 3 6 and 12 months. The SB-MI intervention (3 sessions + booster) was initially developed as the experimental condition in an R34 pilot project which demonstrated its feasibility and promise. For the proposed project the investigators will recruit a larger sample which includes men and women with and without HIV from various ethnic and racial groups sexual orientations and housing arrangements as well as a range of psychiatric disorders and functional capacities. In this way the investigators can more rigorously demonstrate the promise of SB-MI with SMI. The investigators will also conduct a sub-study after the 6 month follow-up to examine the impact at 12 months of an additional booster session for SB-MI participants. The investigators specific aims are:   1. To examine the effectiveness of a brief tailored primary and secondary risk reduction strategy to CAU for people with serious mental illness. The desired outcomes include:   -  Decreased frequency of risk behaviors (number of partners number of encounters)   -  Increased use of barrier precautions and IV needle cleaning   -  Positive changes in information and motivation as well as risk behaviors   -  Increased HIV Counseling and Testing for those who do not know their HIV status   2. To examine the effectiveness of a 2nd booster session after the 6 month follow-up for ½ of participants randomized to SB-MI. The primary outcome will be:   -  Decreased frequency of risk behaviors and increased use of barrier precautions at the 12 month follow-up    ,NCT01172704
HIV,Development of a Methamphetamine Early Intervention, Methamphetamine abuse has a strong and consistent epidemiologic association with high-risk sexual behavior and both prevalent and incident HIV in men who have sex with men (MSM) and some authorities have advocated methamphetamine treatment as an HIV prevention strategy. However methamphetamine interventions have not been evaluated in controlled trials nor have they been implemented and assessed outside of substance abuse treatment programs. This application proposes preliminary investigations to adapt a methamphetamine treatment intervention previously associated with decreased sexual-risk taking among MSM for use as an early intervention among MSM in Seattle Washington. Sixty methamphetamine-using MSM will be enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of contingency management (CM) versus no intervention. CM participants will have their urine tested for methamphetamine 3 times weekly for 12 weeks and will receive vouchers of escalating value when their urines test negative; vouchers will be withheld when participants' urines test positive for methamphetamine or participants miss urine testing visits. All participants will undergo urine methamphetamine testing and audio-computer assisted self-interviews on sexual behavior and substance use at baseline and at 6 week intervals for 6 months. Participants will be tested for HIV syphilis rectal gonorrhea and chlamydial infection and pharyngeal gonorrhea at baseline and at 3 and 6 month follow-up. The study will determine how often MSM will initiate and complete the early intervention and will longitudinally measure unsafe sexual behaviors among intervention and control participants. Study results will determine the feasibility of instituting and studying CM as an early intervention; define whether the intervention is sufficiently promising to justify a larger definitive randomized controlled trial; and will provide estimates for defining the number of participants such a trial would require.    ,NCT01174654
HIV,Russian Labor Migrant HIV Prevention Trial, This study is a randomized outcome trial of a social network HIV prevention intervention for at-risk labor migrants who have arrived in St. Petersburg Russia to seek work. Most come to St. Petersburg from Moldova Tajikistan Uzbekistan Ukraine and other poor post-Soviet republics. While living in Russia labor migrants are also living in a city and country with high HIV prevalence. Many labor migrants have limited awareness of AIDS and most are living in a location far from their spouses family members and others. For that reason labor migrants are vulnerable to risk behavior for contracting HIV. This study hypothesizes that members of labor migrant social networks whose network leaders are trained to deliver HIV prevention messages will exhibit greater reductions in sexual risk behavior (unprotected intercourse with nonspousal partners) from baseline to 3- and 12-month followup assessments than will members of social networks whose members receive standard individual HIV risk reduction counseling alone.    ,NCT01177995
HIV,Epidermal Nerve Fiber Density Fat and Mitochondrial Parameters in Thai HIV+ Patients on d4T and HIV- Patients, This study will provide the range of Epidermal Nerve Fiber Density (ENFD) typically seen in Thai individuals. ENFD values from Thai HIV-negative subjects without neuropathy will be used as appropriate reference norm for Thai HIV-positive subjects. In particular comparison of ENFD values from Thai HIV-negative subjects with baseline ENFD values in Thai HIV-positive subjects prior to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) will allow examination of the effect of HIV per se on ENFD. ENFD from Thai HIV-positive subjects on long-term d4T (stavudine) with and without neuropathy will also provide reference ENFD values at the extremes of the disease process i.e. extent of ENFD decrease in subjects with d4T-induced symptomatic neuropathy and in subjects completely free of disease despite d4T treatment for comparison with Thai HIV-positive subjects on short-term d4T in SEARCH 003 study.    ,NCT01178684

HIV,HIV Indicator Diseases Survey Across Europe - UK Arm," In Europe many patients infected with HIV remain undiagnosed although this percentage varies between 15-80% across the continent. In the UK it is estimated to be 27%. Undiagnosed HIV results in increased morbidity and mortality and reduced treatment response as appropriate health interventions are delayed. It also has adverse public health implications with those individuals unaware of their HIV status being more likely to transmit the virus. An important public health issue is how to diagnose more individuals with HIV earlier in the course of their infection. In the US the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has introduced testing guidelines whereby all individuals are tested unless they object at any point of contact with the healthcare system - the ""opt-out"" testing guidelines. At the ""HIV in Europe"" Conference held in November 2007 the consensus which included patient and public involvement was that such an approach would not be suitable for Europe. The Conference recommended further development of focused HIV testing in patients presenting with certain clinical conditions and diseases - the ""indicator disease'' testing guidelines. Cost effectiveness analyses suggests cost savings if a screened population has an HIV prevalence of at least 1% although this rate may be as low as 0.1%. However there is very little - if any - evidence regarding HIV prevalence for certain conditions and diseases in specific and easy to identify sections of society. The focus of attention is on those conditions and diseases which occur more frequently in individuals known to be infected with HIV. The aim of this study is to assess HIV prevalence for several diseases and conditions within a specific segment of the population not yet diagnosed with HIV who present for care with that specific disease or condition. These conditions have been selected as they occur frequently in individuals already diagnosed with HIV infection. This is a pilot study to inform phase two which will involve more diseases and conditions with a wider participation of centres across Europe.    ",NCT01196468
HIV,Study of Recently HIV Infected Men and Transmission Behaviors, Specific Aim 1: Identify drug use patterns and partnership dynamics that mediate risk behaviors over time in a cohort of recently HIV infected men and their partners. Specific Aim 2: Determine predictors of transmission risk within partnerships of recently HIV infected men and their partners using the partnership as the unit of analysis. Specific Aim 3: Quantify the long-term population-level impacts of voluntary behavior change by men with recent HIV infection through the use of dynamic mathematical modeling that integrates our data on behavior change with current estimates of temporal infectiousness patterns. The investigators will also determine whether more frequent testing and/or development of tests with earlier sensitivity may have a significant impact on the epidemic. Finally the magnitude of this effect to that obtained by decreasing drug use or risky sexual behavior prior to or following seroconversion will be compared. This will be conducted as a statistical analysis by co-investigators at the University of Washington.    ,NCT01201083

HIV,The Use of Lymph Node Biopsies to Support HIV Pathogenesis Studies, HIV medicines have led to dramatic improvements in health. However there remains a concern for potential drug toxicities cost of drugs and need for life-long treatment. In addition research has found that health is not completely restored in HIV-infected patients even if they have been taking effective HIV medicines for a long time. This may be due to direct drug-toxicity continued replication of the virus and/or inflammation of the body in response to the virus. Therefore a more complete understanding of how HIV stays in the body is necessary. Recent research has shown that one of the places that HIV can stay in the body is in lymphatic tissues such as lymph nodes (even in patients who have been taking HIV medicines for a long time). In addition the amount of damage to the lymphatic tissues can predict how the immune system (CD4+ T cell count) will respond to therapy. The investigators therefore propose a study in which lymph nodes from the groin area will be removed with the goals of: 1) seeing how much HIV is in lymph nodes and 2) seeing how much damage has happened to the lymph node architecture.    ,NCT01202305
HIV,Identifying Undiagnosed Asymptomatic HIV Infection in Hispanic/Latino Adolescents and Young Adults, The proposed research will include adolescent and young adult Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual men and women aged 13-24 years and will be based at 13 ATN Adolescent Medicine Trial Units (AMTUs) that provide clinical care and psychosocial services to the target group. In 10 of the 13 sites comparisons will be made between alternative venue-based testing (AVT) and social and sexual network-based interviewing and HIV testing (SSNIT) strategies to assess which among these approaches is the most effective means for identifying undiagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in young at-risk Hispanics/Latinos. Three of the sites will focus solely on use of SSNIT for identifying undiagnosed HIV in our target group of adolescents and young adults. All study participants will complete an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) and undergo HIV screening. Participants with presumptive HIV positive screening results will be referred to the local AMTU for confirmatory testing post-test counseling and referrals for linkage to HIV medical care. Linkage to care for ATN 096 study participants will be conducted in accordance with the Strategic Multisite Initiative for the Identification Linkage and Engagement in Care of Youth with Undiagnosed HIV Infection (SMILE in CARING for YOUTH) Program (ATN 093) a collaboration of the CDC and NICHD/ATN to ensure that youth who test positive for HIV as part of this protocol are linked with treatment and care.    ,NCT01203332

HIV,Multiplex Microarray Chip-Based Diagnosis of Respiratory Infections, Respiratory infections have a high associated morbidity and mortality especially in immunocompromised patients. To initiate effective treatment of respiratory infections it is essential that a rapid and thorough laboratory analysis of respiratory specimens be performed given the wide range of pulmonary pathogens that can be detected in this population. Conventional microbiology is time-consuming and cumbersome and the capability of local laboratories to assess specimens for rare or unusual pathogens is often limited. This study will evaluate if a newer technology can be effectively utilized in the identification of a broader range of infectious agents relative to conventional procedures. Resequencing Pathogen Microarray (RPM) technology developed by TessArae  LLC which ceased operations in July 2014) uses a microarray chip to identify multiple pathogens in a clinical specimen. The technology has had limited clinical application but early studies have shown its effectiveness in accurately identifying a large number of viral and bacterial organisms. In contrast to conventional microbiological procedures based on phenotypic traits (growth characteristic and enzymatic activity) this is microarray utilizes DNA sequence analysis to detect and identify the species serotype/subtype or strain of the infectious agent. Aliquots of respiratory specimens (initially specimens collected by bronchoalveolar lavage BAL) from 200 patients at the NIH Clinical Center and the Washington Hospital Center will be analyzed using the customized microarray chip. The specimens will be collected as part of the patients routine clinical care. The results of the TessArray microarray analysis will not be available to the clinician and therefore will not have any effect on the clinical care of the patients. The results of the microarray analysis from each site will be compared to that site s clinical laboratory results and the data will be analyzed by site.    ,NCT01212042

HIV,Safety Study of Raltegravir in HIV/HCV Co-infected Patients, Current European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) guidelines for the treatment of HIV infection recommend a combination antiretroviral regimen composed of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors licensed for naïve patients - nevirapine and efavirenz - have both been asociated with increased rates of hepatotoxicity (nevirapine) and CNS toxicity (efavirenz) in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Although PI-based therapy has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality it has been limited by complex dosing regimens and toxicities leading to adherence challenges. Varying degree of liver insufficiency may necessitate pharmacokinetic monitoring of the protease inhibitor and may necessitate dose adjustments. In HIV/HCV co-infected patients HAART based on another class of antiretrovirals than NNRTI or PI may thus offer advantages with regard to adverse events and thus long-term efficacy. The overall intention of this trial is to examine in a non-inferiority design the safety and efficacy of a raltegravir based HAART with a standard-of-care HAART in HIV-/HCV co-infected patients. The standard of care used in this study will be atazanavir/ritonavir. All patients will in addition receive a fixed combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine. The primary end-point is the rate of hepatotoxic events defined by ALT elevations.    ,NCT01225705
HIV,Raltegravir Switch Study to Reduce Liver Fibrosis Progression in HIV-Hepatitis C Co-infection, HIV infection exerts a negative impact on the course of HCV infection. Co-infected individuals progress more rapidly to liver fibrosis cirrhosis and ESLD compared to those infected with HCV alone. Some of the this accelerated fibrosis may be related to longterm chronic toxicity from protease inhibitor based ART. Hypothesis: Switching from ritonavir boosted-PI based ART regimen to a Raltegravir-based regimen will reduce the rate of hepatic fibrosis progression in HIV-HCV co-infected patients as measured by transient elastography (Fibroscan®) and the AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI).    ,NCT01231685

HIV,Prevention of HIV and STDs in Drug Using Women, Women Teaching Women (WTW) is proposed by a team of Washington University investigators who have focused on HIV prevention efforts among out-of-treatment injecting drug users (IDUs) and crack cocaine users since 1988. Our peer-delivered prevention model was successful in reducing cocaine use among men. The investigators believe no differences were found in drug and sexual risk behaviors for women because the intervention lacked gender-specificity. Thus the investigators propose to tailor our previous intervention to women's needs to determine the shorter and intermediate term effectiveness of a gender-specific model on reducing drug use and sexual risks. The urgency for women-focused interventions is highlighted by increasing HIV/STD rates among women nationwide. The intervention is designed to bring the HIV prevention message to women in a public health environment. The three-arm intervention which targets out-of-treatment drug-using women will assess the differential impact of a woman-centered standard intervention alone the same standard intervention plus a well-woman exam and those plus the addition of 4 educational sessions. This proposal responds to two NIDA PAs: 95-083 (Women's HIV Risk and Protective Behaviors) and 96-018 (Drug Abuse Prevention Intervention for Women and Minorities). Our risk reduction epidemiological and technology transfer aims include: Risk Reduction Aims:   1. Recruit out-of-treatment female drug injectors heroin crack/cocaine and methamphetamine users to into an intervention aimed at reducing high risk sexual and drug use behaviors. Street outreach bars and clubs shelters health fairs and daycare facilities will be used to reach these vulnerable women at risk.   2. Administer a modified theory-based peer-delivered gender and culture-specific intervention that encourages women to reduce their high risk drug and sexual behaviors. Women will be randomly assigned to one of three peer-delivered interventions: a modified NIDA Cooperative Agreement Standard Intervention (SI) the SI + Well-Woman Exam (SI+WWE) or the SI+Well-Woman Exam + 4 Educational Sessions (SI+WWE+4ES). The Standard Intervention will be delivered by peers; the Well-Woman Examination will be conducted by a nurse practitioner; the four 2 hour educational sessions will be conducted by peer facilitators from area drug treatment programs paired with a community mental health or health professional.   3. Assess the effectiveness of the interventions in reducing drug and sexual risk at 4 and 12 months post-intervention controlling for baseline characteristics.   4. Evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of each intervention. Epidemiologic Aim:   5. Assess: a) incidence of HIV Hepatitis B and C syphilis chlamydia and gonorrhea 12 months post-intervention; b) change in HIV risk and drug and alcohol use at 4 and 12 months post-intervention; c) the effect of psychopathology on behavior change at 12 months post-intervention; d) lifetime history of substance abuse and service utilization for mental and physical problems at baseline. Technology Transfer Aim:   6. Disseminate findings to the scientific community practitioners and community members in formats that are appropriate understandable and usable in order that the best possible women-centered intervention can be developed for reducing HIV risk behaviors. The investigators propose to create a WebSite and present findings at local national and international symposia. Manuals describing the interventions will be developed and made available to the field.    ,NCT01235091

HIV,Addition of Raltegravir to Established Antiretroviral Suppressive Therapy, This study will examine whether intensification with raltegravir of a suppressive antiretroviral regimen in HIV infected patients with poor immune restoration has a beneficial effect on cryptic viral replication and the immune system. Specifically the investigators will examine the effect that raltegravir intensification of ART has on episomal cDNA frequencies immune activation CD4+ cell counts and apoptosis and markers of microbial translocation.    ,NCT01245101
HIV,Will Having Alcohol Treatment Improve Functioning?, The purpose of the study is to find out if a medicationnaltrexone is helpful for HIV-infected women who sometimes drink too much. The study will try to find out whether women like the medication whether the medication helps them cut back on their drinking and whether it helps improve their overall health. Naltrexone has not been used widely among people who are engaged in less severe drinking and in primary health care settings. Therefore the investigators would like to determine whether it is helpful among women who sometimes drink 4 or more drinks per occasion or 7 or more drinks per week. The investigators hypothesize that by taking naltrexone women with hazardous drinking pattern will reduce their drinking which in turn will improve their medication adherence improve their health and quality of life.    ,NCT01245647

Hypotheses: i. XR-NTX will result in improved HIV clinical outcomes including lower changes in HIV-1 RNA levels higher CD4 counts and higher rates of retention in care. ii. XR-NTX will result in improved opioid treatment outcomes including longer time to opioid relapse lower addiction severity and lower craving for opioid. iii. XR-NTX will result in reduced drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors compared to the control group. iv. XR-NTX will result in decreased rates of reincarceration after 12 months of release to the community.    ,NCT01246401

HIV,Study of Autologous T-cells Genetically Modified at the CCR5 Gene by Zinc Finger Nucleases in HIV-Infected Subjects," This research study is being carried out to study a new way to possibly treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The agent is called SB-728-T which are CD4+ T-cells obtained from an individual that are genetically modified at the CCR5 gene by Zinc Finger Nucleases. The CCR5 gene is required for certain types of HIV to enter into and infect T-cells. T cells are one of the white blood cells used by the body to fight HIV. The most important of these are called ""CD4+ T-cells"" Some people are born without the CCR5 gene on their T-Cells. These people remain healthy and are resistant to infection with HIV. Other people have a low number of CCR5 genes on their T-cells and their HIV disease is less severe and is slower to cause disease (AIDS). The purpose of this research study is to find out whether SB-728-T is safe to give to humans and find out how this affects HIV.    ",NCT01252641
HIV,Evaluating Strategies to Reduce Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV Infection in Populations Using Formula Feeding (PROMISE), The purpose of this study is to examine effective methods of preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy labor and delivery. This is one part of the three-part PROMISE study. This study will be conducted at resource-limited locations in Africa and other parts of the world where women typically receive a short course of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during pregnancy and where formula feeding (FF) is standard.    ,NCT01253538
HIV,A Multicentre Trial of Second-line Antiretroviral Treatment Strategies in African Adults Using Atazanavir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir, In the well recognized context of HIV infection chronicity it is now crucial to identify and evaluate effective well tolerated and affordable second line regimen in resources limited countries where patients often change treatment after a long period of viral replication while on first line regimen. This multicentre international randomized non-blinded phase III trial aim to demonstrate the non-inferiority of a generic lamivudine-tenofovir-atazanavir/ritonavir regimen (daily intake) as compared to a standard emtricitabine-tenofovir-lopinavir/ritonavir (twice daily intake)regimen for second line HIV-1 treatment. by stratifying on the viral load level (between 1000 and 5000 copies/mL versus > 5000 copies/mL) at inclusion this trial will also allow to evaluate the optimum moment for instituting the second-line treatment.    ,NCT01255371
HIV,HIV Prevention for PLHIV: Evaluation of an Intervention Toolkit for HIV Care & Treatment Settings, The rapid scale-up of HIV care and treatment in resource-limited settings provides the opportunity to reach many HIV-positive individuals with prevention messages and interventions in care and treatment settings. However HIV prevention is rarely incorporated into the routine care and treatment of people living with HIV leaving missed opportunities to reach patients with critical interventions. This study will evaluate an HIV prevention intervention package for health care settings in sub-Saharan Africa. The HIV prevention intervention will be delivered to HIV-seropositive patients in HIV care and treatment clinics during all routine visits. Health care providers (HCPs) will deliver HIV prevention messages on correct and consistent condom use disclosure of serostatus partner HIV testing adherence and alcohol reduction. They will also assess and treat sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and provide basic contraceptives and safer pregnancy counseling. Trained lay counselors (LCs) will deliver HIV prevention interventions in the clinics. LCs will be persons without medical training many of whom will be PLHIV who will be trained to provide HIV prevention counseling promote HIV testing of partners and children (and provide HIV testing where allowed by national guidelines) and counsel HIV-positive patients on medication adherence and alcohol use. The prevention intervention package will be evaluated in HIV clinics in three sub-Saharan African countries: Kenya Namibia and Tanzania. This project will be a longitudinal group-randomized trial with 9 intervention clinics (3 per country) and 9 comparison clinics (3 per country). Two hundred patients per clinic (total N = 3600) will be followed for 12 months. This evaluation will examine the effectiveness of the HIV prevention interventions delivered by HCPs and LCs on patient-level outcomes such as risky sexual behavior disclosure of HIV status partner HIV testing alcohol use HIV antiretroviral (ARV) medication adherence STI treatment pregnancies and contraceptive use. In addition to the patient outcomes the acceptability of the interventions and materials as well as the feasibility of integrating the interventions into HIV care and treatment settings will be assessed. Data will be collected via patient interviews HCP and LC questionnaires observations of HCP and LC patient visits patient medical chart review and review of clinic service data.    ,NCT01256463
HIV,Study of SystemCHANGE-HIV, The purpose of this study is to assess a new behavioral intervention to help how people living with HIV/AIDS practice self-management skills. Specifically we want to see if a new educational intervention can improve physical activity sleep mental wellness and quality of life in HIV(Human Immunodeficiency Virus)-infected men and women. We hypothesize that those who are in the intervention group will practice more self-management skills than those in the control group.    ,NCT01256814
HIV,Post-prandial Lipid Effects of Raltegravir (RAL) vs Ritonavir -Boosted Darunavir (DRV-r) in Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART)- Naive Adults or Adults Recommencing ART., This is a research study into the effects of three drugs used to treat HIV infection. Some drugs used to treat HIV have been associated with changes in blood fats such as cholesterol that could be harmful over the long-term because these blood fat changes have been associated with a small increased risk of heart disease and stroke in some studies of adults with HIV. Now that HIV can be controlled for long periods in most patients and because heart disease is one of the biggest causes of illness and death in the general population it is important to develop new HIV treatments that control HIV effectively but do not cause abnormal blood fats. Hypothesis: That Raltegravir will result in less post-prandial lipid disturbances than ritonavir-boosted darunavir.    ,NCT01258439
HIV,The Study of the Prevalence of Helicobacter Pylori Infection Among HIV/AIDS Cohort, The purpose of the Study is to investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter Pylori infection among the HIV/AIDS group. The study will screen the patients who were confirmed HIV/AIDS in Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital and collect the cases who were suspicious of Helicobacter Pylori infection.    ,NCT01261208
HIV,Effects of Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone in HIV, HIV-infection and its treatment are often associated with an increase in belly fat as well as abnormal cholesterol and problems metabolizing sugar. People with HIV infection and increased belly fat often have decreased growth hormone (GH) levels. Low GH levels may contribute independently to increased belly fat and to increased cardiovascular risk through effects on sugar metabolism inflammation and other mechanisms. Tesamorelin a growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue has been shown to to reduce belly fat in patients with HIV-associated abdominal fat accumulation. However the effects of tesamorelin on fat accumulation in the liver and muscle sugar metabolism and cardiovascular health are not yet known. The current study is designed to determine the effects of tesamorelin treatment on fat accumulation in the muscle and liver insulin sensitivity and sugar metabolism and markers of cardiovascular health including blood vessel thickness (carotid intima media thickness [cIMT]) and markers of inflammation in the body. The investigators hypothesize that tesamorelin will decrease fat accumulation in the liver and muscle and will decrease markers of inflammation with either neutral or beneficial effects on glucose metabolism.    ,NCT01263717
HIV,Preparing for International Prevention Trials Involving HIV-Infected Individuals in Care Settings, The purpose of this study is to conduct preparatory research needed to design a behavioral intervention to decrease sexual transmission risk behaviors in HIV-infected individuals in care and to determine whether a similar intervention structure can be used across various sexual risk groups and cultural settings.    ,NCT01264185

HIV,High Risk Crack Use Settings and HIV in El Salvador, This project will first increase the accessibility and acceptability of rapid HIV testing in health clinics located in or near four low-income communities in San Salvador El Salvador. The investigators will use crack users' social networks and small incentives as recommended by the CDC in collaboration with the Salvadoran Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) to encourage crack users to receive HIV testing. The second part of the intervention consists of training 8 Peer Leaders to recruit and lead a Peer Network Intervention among 400 crack users to change norms supporting HIV protective behaviors. The intervention will include monthly meetings open to crack using and non-crack using community residents to reinforce HIV risk reduction skills and discussion of other topics related to HIV such as illicit drug use and interpersonal violence and community-wide HIV awareness events. Our hypothesis is that these two intervention features will singly and in combination reduce HIV risk behaviors among Salvadoran crack users.    ,NCT01279421
HIV,Web-Based Middle School HIV Prevention Curricula: Aspiring for Reach and Impact, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based HIV sexually transmitted infection (STI) and pregnancy prevention curriculum as a stand alone intervention for 8th grade students in a large urban school district. This web-based curriculum will be adapted from the computer-based component of an existing successful prevention program It's Your Game?Keep it Real (IYG) but will be enhanced to include critical elements from the IYG classroom component. The primary hypothesis to be tested is: (1) students who receive the web-based curriculum will delay sexual activity relative to those who receive standard care. The major dependent variable is the proportion of students initiating sexual activity (vaginal oral or anal sex). Secondary hypotheses will examine the effect of the web-based curriculum on specific types of sex (e.g. vaginal oral anal) and psychosocial variables such as students' intentions knowledge self-efficacy attitudes and perceived norms related to sexual risk-taking behavior. Secondary hypotheses will also examine the effect of the intervention on the proportion of students who are sexually active number of times students engage in unprotected sexual intercourse and students' number of sexual partners.    ,NCT01280136
HIV,Safer Sex Intervention for Male Clients of Female Sex Workers in Tijuana Mexico," Behavioral interventions designed to reduce risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have mostly failed to consider clients of female sex workers (FSWs) who may act as a ""bridge"" to the general population. This study proposes to test a brief one-hour counseling intervention with male clients in Tijuana Mexico to reduce their rates of unprotected sex (i.e. sex without a condom) with FSWs as well as their rates of infection with HIV and STIs. Finding an effective intervention for this population is important given the rising rates of HIV infection in Tijuana (as documented in earlier studies) and the large numbers of people crossing the border in both directions many of them specifically to purchase sex from FSWs in Tijuana.

HIV,Comparing the PrePex??Device to Surgical Circumcision for Rapid Scale Up of Male Circumcision in Resource Limited Setting, The World Health Organization and UNAIDS cite that male circumcision can reduce the lifetime risk of HIV infection by 60% in high risk areas such as Sub Saharan Africa. Rwanda has a national plan to offer a voluntary circumcision program to 2 million adult men in 2 years as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package. To achieve this goal the government is continuing to study the PrePex??device developed to enable rapid adult male circumcision in resource limited settings. The study will enroll one hundred and fifty (150) persons scheduled for voluntary circumcision. The subjects will be randomly divided into two unbalanced study arms PrePex??arm which will include about a hundred and twenty (100) subjects and surgical circumcision arm which will include about sixty (50) subjects. Study duration per subject will be 9 weeks.    ,NCT01284088

HIV,Longitudinal Pediatric Palliative Care: Quality of Life & Spiritual Struggle, Our goal is to advance palliative care to adolescents and their families. We hope our study will decrease suffering (psychological spiritual physical) and increase quality of life (QOL). Left unprepared for end-of-life decisions miscommunication and disagreements may result in families being charged with neglect or court battles over treatment choices. FAmily CEntered (FACE) Advance Care Planning helps prepare adolescents with HIV/AIDS and their families for future medical decisions. We hope to increase families' understanding of their teens' wishes for end-of-life care and to decrease conflict. We will also study communication and spiritual struggle Families will be randomized into the either the Control (N=65 families) or FACE Intervention (N=65 families). FACE families will meet with a trained/certified researcher for three 60- to 90-minute sessions scheduled one week apart: Session 1: Lyon Advance Care Planning Survey© - Adolescent and Surrogate Versions: Session 2: The Respecting Choices Interview® Session 3: Completion of The Five Wishes©. Control families will also meet with a researcher for three 60-to 90-minute sessions scheduled one week apart: Session 1: Developmental History Session 2: Safety Tips and Session 3: Nutrition. Questionnaires will be administered five times when first seen at 3 6 12 and 18 months from the time of Session 3. Hypothesis 1: Compared to an active control FACE will relieve psychological suffering by 1) increasing congruence in treatment preferences between teens with AIDS and their surrogates 2) decreasing decisional conflict regarding EOL decision making for future medical treatment in adolescents with AIDS; 3) increasing quality communication about EOL care in adolescent/legal guardian or surrogate dyads; 4) and maximizing QOL. Hypothesis 2: In addition to the direct effects FACE will also indirectly affect QOL through dimensions of threat appraisal. Hypothesis 3: FACE will have stronger effects on the QOL measures among patients who have less spiritual struggle. Hypothesis 4: Spiritual struggle has both direct and indirect effects on hospitalization/dialysis use. FACE will also affect hospitalization/dialysis use indirectly through threat appraisal and HAART adherence.    ,NCT01289444

HIV,A Methadone Maintenance Treatment Outcome Study in Three Provinces in China, Methadone treatment has became one of main actions taken in China to control the spread of HIV among drug users. However，the average methadone dose used is relatively low. An intensive methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) provider training on methadone dosage may be effective in increasing the methadone dose levels prescribed to new patients. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored education program for MMT service providers using subsequent methadone dose prescribed to new patients. The effects of methadone dose with and without the inclusion of additional psychosocial services will then be measured through MMT retention and illicit opioid use.    ,NCT01315054
HIV,Personalized Text Messages to Improve Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) Adherence in HIV+ Methamphetamine Users, Methamphetamine (METH) is a debilitating and frequently abused substance that is often comorbid with HIV infection. HIV+ persons with current METH abuse or dependence (HIV+/METH+) have several characteristics in addition to their substance use that make them particularly susceptible to nonadherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) including elevated rates of neurocognitive impairment co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders and unstable living situations. The investigators propose an intervention development study designed to address these potential mechanisms of nonadherence with the following Specific Aims: 1) To further develop and refine a personalized automated real-time mobile phone text messaging intervention (iTAB) designed to improve adherence to ART medications among HIV+/METH+ persons; 2) To evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a brief psychoeducation plus text messaging intervention (iTAB) as compared to psychoeducation alone (CTRL) for the improvement of objectively measured medication adherence among HIV+/METH+ persons; and 3) To examine predictors of within-person trajectories of nonadherence using the longitudinal data collected over the study. In order to realize these aims the investigators will leverage the infrastructure of two unique UCSD resources increasing likelihood of study success impact and innovation: 1) the Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC) which is a NIDA-funded center that focuses on the combined effects of METH and HIV infection and 2) the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) which conducts research on state-of-the-art wireless means of health promotion. Initially the investigators will refine the iTAB intervention to ensure that it is user-centered and tailored to the needs of HIV+/METH+ persons via focus groups and rapid prototyping. Once refined the proposed iTAB intervention will use text messages that are automated scalable personalized interactive flexible and motivating. The investigators will assess the acceptability and effectiveness of iTAB in improving objectively measured adherence (i.e. MEMS caps) over a 6-week period via a pilot RCT with 40 HIV+/METH+ assigned to the iTAB intervention and 20 HIV+/METH+ assigned to a psychoeducational control. Predictors of nonadherence including frequency of METH use neuropsychological impairment and mood will be examined to determine whether iTAB is better able to compensate for these factors associated with nonadherence as compared to CTRL. Further refinement to the iTAB intervention will be made in order to pursue a large-scale R01 using our tailored intervention.    ,NCT01317277
HIV,Behavioral Science Aspects of Rapid Test Acceptance, The relevance of this research to public health is to make it possible to test for hepatitis C and syphilis at point of care so that people will receive their results immediately instead of requiring people to wait for at least a week to get their test results.

HIV,Vaginal Innate Immunity in Normal and HIV-Infected Women, The innate immunity of the vaginal tract provides first-line defense from abnormal microorganisms or overgrowth of common organisms such as Candida species or Gardnerella vaginalis. It is unclear from the current available literature whether the rate of vaginal infection increases or decreases in frequency during pregnancy when compared to the non-pregnant state but this may be predicted by shifts in vaginal innate immunity. Vaginal infections are important players in HIV disease potentially increasing the risk of viral transmission. In addition these infections may activate inflammatory markers in the reproductive tract and increase the risk of premature delivery or other negative pregnancy outcomes. The vaginal innate immune system has not been well characterized in pregnant women or in women with HIV infection. The study of how this system changes in pregnancy and HIV infection will provide essential knowledge for further study of vaginal mucosal protection. The investigators study is an observational study designed to compare levels of vaginal innate immunity markers in women based on a) pregnancy status and b) HIV infection status. Comparisons will be made between pregnant and non- pregnant women and between HIV positive and HIV negative women. The investigators hypothesize that there will be significant differences in levels of innate immunity between the groups.    ,NCT01318304

HIV,Levels of Raltegravir in the Female Genital Tissue, This study is an investigation of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in the tissue of the female genital tract to determine if twice-daily dosing of 400mg achieves adequate drug levels to prevent viral integration of HIV-1. The study will also assess whether drug levels change in the tissue across the different phases of the menstrual cycle.   -  Hypothesis #1: Twice daily dosing with raltegravir 400mg will result in intracellular concentrations that should be sufficient to suppress HIV-1 replication throughout the menstrual cycle.   -  Hypothesis #2: Intracellular genital raltegravir peaks will be lower and troughs higher compared to extracellular concentrations in the plasma and PMBCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells).   -  Hypothesis #3: Intracellular raltegravir concentrations will be slightly lower during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle due to cellular pumps such as p-glycoprotein which are present in higher numbers during periods of high progesterone.    ,NCT01327482

HIV,Effect of a Non-tenofovir Non-efavirenz-based HIV Regimen on Bone Density and Vitamin D Levels in African-American Patients With HIV Infection, 2. Objectives   1. To determine the vitamin D status of African-American HIV patients who are HIV-treatment naïve.   2. To compare the effects of an efavirenz-containing regimen to a protease inhibitor regimen on 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 125 dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels.   3. To compare the effect on bone density of a tenofovir- and efavirenz-containing regimen to a regimen that does not contain these drugs.   4. To compare the efficacy of an alternative regimen (raltegravir darunavir ritonavir) to a standard once-daily regimen (tenofovir-emtricitabine-efavirenz). Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving efavirenz will be more likely to have lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 125 dihydroxyvitamin D3levels based on the fact that efavirenz is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP24 enzymes that degrade 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 125 dihydroxyvitamin D3 respectively to inactive metabolites. The investigators speculate that patients on a tenofovir-containing regimen will be more likely to have progression of bone density loss compared to those in the non-tenofovir-containing regimen.    ,NCT01343225
HIV,Antiretroviral Resistance Detection by Ultrasensitive Pyrosequencing of the HIV-1 Genome and Virological Response to Antiretroviral Rescue Treatment, This study aims to analyze the association between the baseline detection of resistance mutations through Ultra deep Sequencing (UDS) and the virological outcome of salvage antiretroviral therapy in comparison with conventional genotypic resistance tests. Based on the data generated in this study new resistance interpretation tools and algorithms will be developed to improve the prediction of antiretroviral therapy outcomes. The final aim of the study is to improve the clinical care of HIV-1-infected patients through the incorporation of improved new antiretroviral resistances tests in the clinical practice.    ,NCT01346878

HIV,The PeerCARE Study (Peer Community-based Assistant in REtention), The provision of HIV care and prevention services in resource-limited settings (RLS) entails substantial challenges due to a human resource crisis.[1] One strategy to address this human resource crisis is task shifting?the redistribution of tasks from higher trained providers to health workers with less training. Peer supporters a group of community health workers who are people living with HIV (PLHIV) are an underutilized cadre to whom tasks can be shifted. Peers have been used extensively and effectively in HIV/AIDS programs in RLS typically as peer educators who provide HIV prevention and education services.[2] Peers may be a potential source for not only providing care but also impacting patient behaviors through peer counseling education and psychosocial support. With the scale up of HIV counseling and testing in RLS increasing numbers of PLHIV know their serostatus and could potentially be engaged in care and prevention services. While antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a critical component of care which has been a source of much attention PLHIV who are not yet on ART can also benefit from being engaged in care and utilizing other evidence-based health interventions besides ART. Also many HIV/AIDS care programs have difficulty both retaining PLHIV in care prior to ART and initiating ART in a timely fashion. Additionally many PLHIV not yet on ART still engage in risky sexual behaviors and do not fully utilize a proven basic preventive care package (BCP) set of interventions (cotrimoxazole prophylaxis bed nets and safe water systems). Peers may be able to impact PLHIV not yet on ART by improving linkages to care facilitating timely initiation of preventive interventions and ART and decreasing risky sexual behaviors. However well-designed and evaluated operations research is needed to assess peer support effects on these care and behavioral outcomes. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a peer support home visit intervention on patient engagement in care utilization of a basic care package (BCP) of preventive care interventions and risky sexual behaviors among people living with HIV (PLHIV) not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) through an individually randomized operations research community-based trial. We will compare outcomes between PLHIV who receive the peer-led intervention to those who do not. The primary outcomes will be engagement in care BCP adherence and condom use. The study hypotheses are as follows: (1) PLHIV who receive the peer intervention will have improved engagement in care compared to PLHIV not receiving the intervention; (2) PLHIV who receive the peer intervention are more likely to adhere to a BCP of interventions to prevent illness compared to PLHIV not receiving the intervention; (3) PLHIV who receive the peer intervention will have less risky sexual behaviors compared to PLHIV not receiving the intervention.    ,NCT01366690
HIV,Changes in Cerebral Function in Treatment Naive HIV-1 Infected Subjects Commencing Either Boosted Atazanavir With Truvada or Boosted Darunavir With Maraviroc and Kivexa, The purpose of this study is to compare two different combination anti-HIV therapies over 48 weeks and to assess if differences in improvement in the function of the brain are observed over this period. The study will compare anti-HIV therapy combinations which are currently in use. The patients will not have had any previous treatment for their HIV infection.    ,NCT01367236
HIV,Vitamin D HIV Study, The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of vitamin D on measures of bone health and immune function in HIV infected postmenopausal women. The investigators prior research with this population revealed that low vitamin D levels are very common. Prior research with this population also revealed that Vitamin D is necessary for the body to absorb calcium and is important for the health of the bones. When vitamin D levels are low there are increased risks of bone loss muscle weakness falls and fractures. Low levels of vitamin D have also been associated with impaired immune function. This study will help us learn whether two different doses of vitamin D will improve bone health and immune function.    ,NCT01375010
HIV,Project FIRST - Financial Incentives to Reduce Substance Use and Improve Treatment, This study will test whether contingency management (monetary vouchers contingent on abstinence from drugs) that reinforces one behavior (achieving abstinence from drugs) leads to improved outcomes in other related behaviors (achieving HIV viral load suppression). In a randomized controlled trial the investigators propose to test whether an abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention improves viral load suppression in HIV-infected drug users.    ,NCT01376570
HIV,Naltrexone for Medication Compliance Among HIV-infected Men With Alcohol Use Disorder, This study will recruit 159 HIV-infected men with alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Men will be randomized to receive either oral naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol use disorder or placebo. Men with acute recent or established HIV infection will receive antiretroviral treatment (ART) and be randomized to oral naltrexone or placebo. The purpose of this study is to see whether use of oral naltrexone improves medication compliance and therefore HIV viral load suppression among men with alcohol use disorder. The study will also assess the impact of oral naltrexone on alcohol use behaviors in this population.    ,NCT01377168
HIV,HIV Screening Take-up: Evaluating Incentives and Opt-out Strategies," Over twenty percent of HIV-positive persons in the United States are unaware of their infection leading the Institute of Medicine to recently urge further work to compare the effectiveness of HIV screening strategies. This study will use a randomized trial to compare several variants of emergency-room-based HIV-testing policies in order to determine how HIV test acceptance rates can be increased. The testing policies will be designed using principles from behavioral economics varying the choice architecture and offering small monetary incentives. This will be the first study to measure differences in take-up rates across a variety of promising but largely untested approaches within a unified randomized trial. Three defaults will be tested: traditional opt-in (test only those patients who request testing) opt-out (routinely testing unless patients decline) and active-choice testing (patients are required to state whether they want to be tested). The study will also be the first to test the effect of small monetary incentives ($1 $5 $10) on test take-up. An additional novel study contribution will be to test the hypothesis that compliance with large requests (accept an HIV test) increases after making a small request or pre-commitment - this ""foot in the door"" technique has not been previously studied in this setting. The factorial design will permit a direct comparison of all interventions as well as interactions. The study will contribute a nuanced empirical understanding of how testing protocols from behavioral economics theory affect the effectiveness and efficiency of screening programs in an actual scaled- up setting (San Francisco General Hospital). This will assist in implementing and assessing recent CDC guidelines on HIV screening while also more generally advancing scientific knowledge related to applying behavioral economics in comparative effectiveness research.

HIV,HIV/STI Prevention for Adolescents With Substance Use Disorders in Treatment, Adolescents with substance use disorders (SUD) are at substantial risk for contracting HIV/STIs compared to their counterparts without SUD yet few HIV/STI sexual risk reduction interventions have been developed to meet their unique needs and none use a family-based intervention approach which the literature recommends as the focus for intervention for youth. Current state policies neither require providers in clinics delivering substance use treatment to offer HIV/STI sexual risk reduction nor offer providers tools or training for HIV/STI prevention. There is clear public health need to develop innovative methods of service delivery and effective strategies of HIV/STI sexual risk reduction that address multiple contexts of risk (i.e. family) for this high risk population. The current proposal addresses this need by developing a provider-delivered HIV sexual risk reduction intervention to be implemented in outpatient SUD treatment that: 1) builds the clinics' capacity to help families under their care to more comfortably address the adolescent's sexuality; 2) promotes youth's safer sex practices; and 3) reduces HIV/STI sexual risk behaviors among adolescents with SUD in care.    ,NCT01383837
HIV,Maraviroc Switch Collaborative Study, MARCH is an international multicentre trial planning to enroll 380 HIV-1 infected patients who are currently on 2N(t)RTI + PI/r regimen and virologically suppressed. Participants will be randomized (1:2:2) to one of three treatment groups: to continue their current treatment regimen maraviroc dose at 150 mg twice daily with PI/r or maraviroc at 300 mg twice daily with 2N(t)RTI. As the participants population have HIV RNA <200 copies/mL the phenotypic assessment of tropism cannot be used to determine tropism instead we will employ the genotypic assessment of tropism by sequencing the V3 loop of the HIV envelope. The main aim of this study is to investigate whether switching to maraviroc in combination with either RTI or PI/r is as good at keeping the HIV viral load undetectable as the combination of RTI with PI/r. The other aim is to see if switching to these combinations with maraviroc will improve some of the side effects that can be seen when people take combination therapy including RTI and PI/r. The study hypothesis is that in stable virologically suppressed (plasma HIV-RNA <200 copies/mL) patients with no history of prior virological failure a switch to either MVC dosed at 300mg twice daily (bid) combined with the same 2N(t)RTI backbone regimen or MVC dosed at 150mg twice daily (bid) with the current PI/r (or 300mg bid at the discretion of the investigator if the PI/r is fosamprenavir/r) provides similar (non-inferior) antiretroviral efficacy compared to continuation of the current 2N(t)RTI + PI/r regimen.    ,NCT01384682

HIV,Eplerenone in HIV Associated Abdominal Fat Accumulation, The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a drug eplerenone along with lifestyle modification to affect sugar metabolism body fat distribution and cardiovascular health in HIV-infected individuals. In non-HIV-infected individuals recent data has shown that aldosterone a hormone that regulates salt and water balance is increased in association with increased belly fat and decreased insulin sensitivity. In HIV-infected individuals aldosterone appears to be higher in individuals with increased belly fat and increased aldosterone appears to be strongly associated with impaired sugar metabolism. In this study the investigators will test the effects of eplerenone which is a medication that blocks the actions of aldosterone along with lifestyle modification. The investigators hypothesize that eplerenone may improve sugar metabolism improve markers of cardiovascular health and reduce fat accumulation in liver and muscle.    ,NCT01405456
HIV,Moringa Oleifera- Antiretroviral Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction, A study will be conducted by scientists from the University of Zimbabwe to determine if antiretroviral drugs are affected by taking herbs at the same time. This is important because herbal medicines may interact with modern medicine to increase or decrease the amount of medication in the body. The drugs nevirapine and efavirenz will be studied. Both drugs are routinely used as part of combination therapy for treating HIV. In this study it will be determined whether the concentrations of the antiretroviral drugs nevirapine and efavirenz are low high or are in the desired range when taken together with the herb moringa.    ,NCT01410058
HIV,HEART to HAART: Smartphone Intervention to Improve HAART Adherence for Drug Users, HIV infected drug users have greater difficulty adhering to highly active antiretroviral therapy compared to non-drug users. As sustained adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy is critical to reducing HIV related morbidity mortality and reducing the spread of HIV innovative and potentially sustainable treatment strategies that can optimize the durability of adherence enhancing interventions among drug users is urgently needed. The goal of this study is to further develop and pilot test a smartphone based intervention called HEART (Helping Enhance Adherence to Retroviral therapy using Technology) to HAART to enhance adherence to HAART among HIV infected drug users.    ,NCT01413529
HIV,Home Assessment and Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV in Malawi, Despite increasing availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV in high prevalence countries the majority of people with HIV infection still initiate treatment at an advanced stage of disease. This leads to a high risk of death soon after HIV diagnosis. Prompt HIV diagnosis is therefore necessary for both individual and public health benefit and is being strongly promoted as international and national policy in Malawi. However timely HIV diagnosis may not in itself be sufficient to ensure ART initiation: this is reflected by the relatively high proportion of individuals who defer treatment-seeking for months or years following diagnosis of HIV. Here the researchers investigate the extent to which home assessment and initiation of ART adds to the effectiveness of a home-based HIV testing and counseling strategy using entry to adherence with and retention in HIV care as the outcome of interest.    ,NCT01414413
HIV,Lower Extremity Splinting to Manage Pain and Sleep Disturbances Associated With HIV/AIDS Related Peripheral Neuropathy, WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY? The investigators want to know if wearing a pair of splints at night works to bring the pain down and help you sleep better (in people living with HIV/AIDS related neuropathy). HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE? About 58 to 88 people will take part in this study at the Harris County Hospital District (HCHD). WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THIS STUDY? As a participant you will be assigned to one of two treatment groups. In one group you will be asked to wear leg splints at night and the other you will wear the liners of the splints only. You will be asked to answer questions about how well you sleep how long you sleep and about your discomfort at the legs. The researcher will be there to help but the investigators want you to answer the questions on your own if you can. You will be asked to reach forwards standing next to a wall and to walk for 6 minutes after that. The tests will de done in random order. The sessions will be done at the beginning at week three and week six. You should finish all of the testing and questionnaires in an hour or less for a total of three hours over six weeks in the investigators clinic. You will receive instructions on how to use the splints with liners or the liners alone at home. You will be asked to wear them at night only for the next 6 weeks. Finally the principal investigator will contact you weekly by phone to discuss issues of comfort and your ability to adhere to the instructions provided.    ,NCT01419314

HIV,DRIVESHAFT: Darunavir/Ritonavir In HIV-infected Virologically-suppressed Experienced Subjects, Darunavir is a nonpeptidic protease inhibitor with a high genetic barrier to resistance that evolved from a prototype compound synthesized using structure-based design strategies. Once-daily darunavir at 800mg boosted with 100mg of ritonavir is an effective antiretroviral agent indicated for HIV-infected treatment-naïve patients. In treatment-experienced patients darunavir was initially approved for twice-daily administration boosted with twice-daily ritonavir at 600mg and 100mg respectively. Recently once-daily darunavir/ritonavir was approved for use in treatment-experienced adult patients with viremia with no darunavir resistance mutations. In treatment-experienced patients with viral suppression switching from an antiretroviral taken twice-daily to a once-daily dose is an attractive option to promote greater patient acceptability and adherence and potentially minimize side effects and toxicities. Because of darunavir/ritonavir's high genetic barrier to resistance and well-established safety profile at a once-daily dose switching patients with virologic suppression from twice-daily darunavir/ritonavir to once-daily darunavir/ritonavir will likely confer attributes more favorable to patients through a simplified dosing schedule and lower potential for lipid elevation without the loss of virologic control. DRIVESHAFT is a 48-week Phase 4 randomized open label comparative study. The study will be conducted in 60 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral experienced virologically-suppressed patients on regimens containing darunavir 600mg/ ritonavir 100mg twice-daily and a minimum of two other antiretrovirals with a history of 0-1 darunavir-associated resistance mutations. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to switch to darunavir 800mg/ ritonavir 100mg once-daily or continue on their current regimen. Rates of virologic suppression of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir regimens relative to darunavir/ritonavir twice-daily regimens will be compared and safety change from baseline fasting lipid parameters and adherence will be evaluated.    ,NCT01423812

A substudy focuses on the broader range of nursing care in HIV-treatment examining the content of care delivered to support physical mental sexual and social well-being; whether the delivery of the AIMS intervention affects the quality of care on domains other than adherence; and whether the content of care on these various domains can be linked to patient well-being and satisfaction.    ,NCT01429142
HIV,Efficacy of Neuro-HAART in Patients With HIV, Patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are at risk of brain related complications despite the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Such complications are termed HIV neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and comprise a spectrum from asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to severe HIV dementia (HAD). Prior to HAART approximately 30% of patients with advanced HIV disease had cognitive impairment; with HAART the incidence of HAND has decreased but its prevalence increased. The reasons for the ongoing development of cognitive impairment in HAART treated patients are not clear. They might relate to virus induced brain injury prior to starting HAART the onset of a separate neurological process toxicity related to HAART or ongoing viral infection in the brain. It is clear that the ability of different antiretroviral drugs to penetrate the brain varies but what is not established is whether these differences between drugs lead to different neurological outcomes. The investigators propose to study HIV infected patients stable on HAART for 12 months; subdividing the groups according to the brain penetrance of their drug combination. Patients would undergo neuropsychological assessment and MRI brain scan at the start of the study and after 12 months. Differences in neuropsychological tests and MRI would be sought between treatment groups to establish whether HAART with better CNS penetration is associated with better outcome and fewer MRI changes.    ,NCT01434654
HIV,Efficiency of the Hepatitis B Sci-B-Vac Vaccine in HIV Positive Patients, HBV vaccination is of paramount importance among HIV positive persons due to an increased risk of infection and disease progression. The most widely used ENGERIX B vaccine reaches a lower rate of vaccination (20-70%) among HIV positive vaccinees (compared to over 90% in the normal population). Sci-B-Vac is novel vaccine containing 3 antigens and is therefore more immunogenic (as opposed to one in ENGERIX B). Its use has been associated with higher and more rapid vaccination rates. Therefore it has a theoretical advantage in HIV positive individuals.    ,NCT01437475
HIV,A Study on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Naïve Patients On Different Regimens to Treat Hiv (NORTHIV), The present study aims to compare efficacy side-effects and treatment adherence of three different treatment regimens given to antiretroviral naïve HIV-1 infected patients. Treatment will be initiated in accordance with the Swedish National Guidelines. In the twice daily (BID) arm (1) which could be considered as a standard regimen at present lopinavir/ritonavir is co-administrated with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) administrated BID. The first once daily (QD) arm (2) combines the protease inhibitor (PI) atazanavir/ritonavir with 2 NRTIs administrated QD and in the second QD arm (3) the non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz is combined with 2 NRTIs administrated QD. All drugs used in the study are licensed in the participating countries and patients will be followed as in clinical practice. Patients could optionally after informed consent be followed with additional measurements of HIV-1 RNA after 1 2 and 3 weeks of treatment to asses the kinetics of viral decline after initiation of treatment.    ,NCT01445223
HIV,Analysis of Data Collected From Individuals Administered Neurobehavioral Assessments, Background:   -  People with chronic illness often are at risk for developing neurobehavioral problems due to effects of the disease or associated treatments. These problems may include cognitive impairments involving problem-solving remembering things paying attention and understanding and using language or emotional functioning or quality of life.   -  The National Cancer Institute Medical Illness Counseling Center Neuropsychology Group has collected data from neurobehavioral evaluations of infants children adolescents and adults with chronic illnesses enrolled in NIH protocols since 1987 and continues to collect data from patients enrolled in current protocols.   -  The data from these evaluations along with demographic and medical information are stored in an NIH computer database.   -  Investigating the neurobehavioral functioning of patients with chronic illness is important for identifying and monitoring the effects of the disease and treatments over time determining possible at-risk subgroups evaluating response to therapy and recommending educational and rehabilitative interventions. Objectives: -To learn about how certain illnesses or treatments may affect a person s cognitive abilities emotional functioning and quality of life. Eligibility:   -  Patients currently enrolled in NIH studies who are having neuropsychological testing or completing quality-of-life questionnaires as part of that study.   -  Data obtained from infants children adolescents and adults administered neurobehavioral assessments as part of a past or future NIH protocol. Design:   -  This study does not involve any extra tests or questionnaires; it uses information collected from evaluations that subjects have already completed or will complete as part of other NIH studies.   -  Information about participating patients that may help elucidate how cognitive abilities emotional functioning and quality of life are affected in people with chronic illness may be collected and stored.    ,NCT01445314
HIV,Promoting Male Involvement to Improve Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) Uptake and Reduce Antenatal Infection, This study will evaluate the impact of combining two evidence-based interventions: a couples risk reduction intervention with an evidence based medication adherence intervention designed to enhance male participation in combination with improving medication and prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) adherence in antenatal clinics (ANCs). Clinics will be randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions and effectiveness of the combined intervention to enhance PMTCT as well as reduce antenatal seroconversion by both individuals and clinics will be examined. It is hypothesized that community clinics implementing PartnerPlus will have more effective PMTCT program adherence as measured by total participant 1) maternal and paternal ANC and PartnerPlus visits 2) maternal and paternal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Counseling & Testing (HCT) uptake 3) maternal and infant antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis uptake 4) maternal highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) uptake 5) infant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV and 5) maternal and infant HIV serostatus and that community clinics implementing PartnerPlus will have reduced sexual risk behavior as measured by participant sexual barrier use.    ,NCT01448512

HIV,Trial To Assess The Lipid-Lowering Effect Of Adding Tenofovir/Emtricitabine Co-Formulation Vs Placebo To Hiv-1-Infected Subjects With Dyslipidemia And Sustained Viral Load Suppression Under Monotherapy With Ritonavir-Boosted Protease Inhibitors, This is a phase IV multicenter prospective randomised crossover double blind placebo-controlled and proof of concept clinical trial. All subjects fulfilling inclusion criteria will be randomised to add either TDF/FTC co-formulation (group A) or placebo (Group B) to their current PI/r regimen i.e.: DRV/r 800/100 mg QD or LPV/r 400/100 BID. This will be followed by a crossover addition of TDF/FTC co-formulation or placebo. Randomization will be centralised in the CRO FLS-Research Support and will be stratified by DRV/r or LPV/r intake at baseline to ensure equal distribution in both arms. TDF/FTC co-formulation or Placebo will be provided in a double-blinded fashion i.e.: neither the treating physician nor the patient will know whether the patient is receiving TDF/FTC or placebo. All subjects will receive dietary counselling to promote lipid-lowering diet provided by a specialised dietician throughout the study. The expected duration of the study for each participant will be 36 weeks. There will be 6 visits: screening baseline and weeks 4 12 24 and 36.    ,NCT01458977
HIV,Obesity in HIV After Antiretroviral Therapy, This is a retrospective longitudinal study that evaluates the prevalence and incidence of overweight/obesity within an HIV-infected population before and after 12 and 24 months of a stable antiretroviral therapy (ART). The study group will be compared to the weight of a healthy matched population that is not infected with HIV. The primary hypothesis states that the proportion of HIV-infected persons newly classified as overweight/obese will increase by ??0% after 12 months of initial ART and this incidence will be greater than that of a matched HIV-uninfected control population. The effect of immune function variables such as CD4 HIV viral load and ART regimen on weight will be analyzed. In addition the study will analyze the effect of weight and immune function markers on the inflammatory markers high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and D-dimer. An HIV samples repository will be used for specimens to be assayed for hsCRP and D-dimer.    ,NCT01461876
HIV,Implementation of an Efficacious Intervention for High Risk Women in Mexico," This project seeks to determine the personal and organizational conditions that are most conducive to the widespread adoption by community-based organizations (CBOs) of effective programs for reducing the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Taking a brief single-session counseling program (called ""Mujer Segura"") that has been proven effective in reducing HIV and STIs in female sex workers who work in Mexican cities along the U.S. border this project will study the implementation of the program in CBOs in 12 additional cities throughout Mexico to determine how best to ensure that the program remains true to the original model and retains its effectiveness. Mexico has been chosen because HIV is a global problem that respects no international borders and because HIV prevention programs that can be implemented in settings with limited resources are urgently needed in many parts of the world.

HIV,Bioequivalence Study of Pediatric Formulations to Treat HIV Infection, The purpose of the study is to determine the bioavailability/bioequivalence of two pediatric formulations (tablet and reconstitutable suspension) of lamivudine/zidovudine/ nevirapine in comparison to an innovator product. Establishing the bioequivalence of a newly developed age-appropriate fixed dose combination of lamivudine/zidovudine/ nevirapine as an oral dispersible tablet or a reconstitutable suspension for children is invaluable for future product registration and availability of the products to children thus filling the void in pediatric HIV/AIDS therapy.    ,NCT01469520
HIV,The Effect of Hyperbilirubinemia on CV Disease Neurocog Function and Renal Function, Use of some protease inhibitors is associated with elevations of a blood pigment called bilirubin. This may occasionally lead to yellowing of the eyes (scleral icterus) or jaundice but in the general population bilirubin elevations have been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could be associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular or other disease events. Inflammation may also be relevant to neurocognitive impairment in HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection hence elevations of bilirubin may also be protective against neurocognitive impairment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of hyperbilirubinemia (HBR) on risk of heart and renal diseases and cognitive function.    ,NCT01475240
HIV,Antiretroviral Drug Interaction Study in Volunteers With HIV, Background: - People who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at risk of getting certain diseases. Two of these diseases are a type of pneumonia known as PCP and a brain infection called toxoplasmosis. Most people with HIV take antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to treat HIV and lower the risk of infections. However some ARV drugs may make other drugs used to treat PCP and toxoplasmosis less effective. Researchers want to test specific ARV drugs to see if they affect atovaquone a drug used to treat PCP and toxoplasmosis. Objectives: - To see if ARV drugs atazanavir-ritonavir or efavirenz lower the blood levels of atovaquone. Eligibility:   -  Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who have HIV.   -  Participants must be taking efavirenz or atazanavir-ritonavir or not taking any ARV drugs. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood and urine tests.   -  This study has a screening visit and five study visits. Two of the study visits will last about 12 hours; the other three visits will last about 1 hour each.   -  Participants will receive either a low dose or high dose of atovaquone to take for 14 days. They will record doses and any symptoms on a diary card at home.   -  After 14 days participants will have a 12-hour visit to provide blood samples. There will be a wash-out period with no doses for up to 6 weeks.   -  After the wash-out period participants will switch dose levels to either the high or low dose.   -  After 14 days participants will have a 12-hour visit to provide blood samples.    ,NCT01479361

HIV,Randomized Controlled Trial Using Patient Reported Outcomes and Care Managers to Improve HIV Medication Adherence in Routine Clinical Care, Among HIV-infected patients adherence to antiretroviral medications is one of the most important determinants of clinical outcomes including viral suppression viral resistance disease progression and death. Unfortunately poor adherence among patients with HIV is very common mean levels of adherence in clinical cohorts are 60-75% or less. Alcohol drug abuse and mental illness particularly depression symptoms are key predictors of poor adherence common among HIV-infected individuals and important to identify and treat among nonadherent patients. This study will examine the ability of patient reported outcomes (PROs) and a targeted care management approach to improve clinical outcomes with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in routine clinical care of patients with HIV. The investigators will determine whether healthcare delivery team notification of PROs including antiretroviral medication adherence and barriers of adherence such as depression and substance abuse along with tailored intervention recommendations and targeted care management leads to improvement in both process and clinical outcomes including patient-reported outcomes. The investigators will examine process outcomes such as use of clinic support services and patient outcomes such as improvement in adherence substance use depression and HIV-1 RNA levels.    ,NCT01505660

HIV,Bone and Body Comp: A Sub Study of the SECOND-LINE Study, The use of anti HIV drugs (ART) and in particular a class of drugs known as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N(t)RTI) has been associated with changes in body fat and in particular loss of peripheral fat in the limbs. Low bone mineral density and osteoporosis are also common in HIV-infected patients. There appears to be some association between ART and bone loss but this is poorly understood and requires further research. The SECOND-LINE study provides an opportunity to examine if a new anti-HIV drug (raltegravir) can result in greater increase in limb fat than a drug regimen containing N(t)RTI which is currently standard of care. This study also provides an opportunity to examine if additional bone loss occurs with the second regimen of anti-HIV drugs and whether non-N(t)RTI regimens of ART used in second line therapy result in more or less bone loss than use of other classes of anti-HIV drugs such as protease inhibitors or N(t)RTI combinations. It is hypothesized that subjects randomised into Raltegravir arm will demonstrate greater increases in limb fat and smaller reductions in bone density at the proximal femur over 48 weeks than those randomised into the control arm (LPV/r + 2-3N(t)RTIs).    ,NCT01513122

HIV,Short Term Intensified Chemo-immunotherapy in HIV-positive Patients With Burkitt Lymphoma, This is a multicenteropen-label trial to evaluate activity and safety of the investigational intensive in HIV+ patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. Experimental treatment consists of an induction phase followed by a consolidation or intensified phase according to tumor response. Until recently the immuno-compromised state of patients with concomitant HIV/AIDS and BL was thought to limit the ability to administer intensive chemotherapeutic regimens due to infection rate. However the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and evidence in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas that HIV-positive patients can tolerate standard chemotherapeutic regimens with improved outcomes have led investigators to treat HIV-positive patients with the same intensive chemotherapy regimens used to treat immuno-competent patients. Data suggest that these current approaches along with supportive care may result in improved patient outcomes similar to those in the immuno-competent patient population.    ,NCT01516593
HIV,Evaluation of the MBio Combined Syphilis/HIV Point-of-Care Diagnostic Test, This is a diagnostic validation study for a combined Syphilis/HIV test made by MBio Diagnostics Inc (MBio Boulder CO USA). Although the MBio Syphilis/HIV diagnostic platform is designed for use at point of care (POC) it is made to provide similar performance as reference standards. Diagnosing HIV and syphilis accurately with a single POC test will save time for clinic health workers and technicians reduce loss-to follow-up caused by lengthy delays for lab-based tests and save costs by eliminating the need for multiple tests. For this study the sensitivity and specificity of the MBio HIV/Syphilis Serology System point-of-care diagnostic test will be determined using reference tests performed under controlled laboratory conditions. For this clients receiving routine care in the ANCs at the New Nyanza Provincial General Hospital (NNPGH) and Kisumu District Hospital (KDH) will be consented to provide blood for the proposed study. Study volunteers will receive HIV and syphilis rapid tests provided as part of routine care and will donate an additional blood for evaluating the MBio test against the reference tests in a laboratory setting. This study is an investigational prototype not for product registration. The results from this study will be used to inform product development of a second iteration of the MBio device design. At the time that the device is ready to be registered it will undergo another field evaluation at which time it will be submitted to the appropriate regulatory body. Because the MBIO device is an HIV test the device would be submitted to National AIDS & STI Control Program (NASCOP) which is the appropriate regulatory body for HIV tests in Kenya.    ,NCT01530672

HIV,Fracture and Bone Mineral Density in HIV+ Patients Recently Started on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), In a group of HIV-positive patients under observation since their first exposure to ART or monitored off of ART BMD changes over one year will be determined. For each subject the investigators will also determine associations between changes in BMD and 1) ART initiation 2) cumulative viremia (measured by copy-years viremia) and 3) inflammation (evaluated through the measurement of interleukin-6 {IL-6} tumor necrosis factor alpha {TNF-a} high-sensitivity c-reactive protein {hsCRP}). Hypotheses: BMD will decrease less in persons initiated on ART than those monitored off of ART after excluding those subjects treated with tenofovir. BMD will decrease most significantly in HIV-positive subjects with the highest levels of cumulative viremia. HIV-positive persons with highest cumulative viremia will have the highest levels of inflammation as measured by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally the investigators will evaluate fracture incidence in a 5% National Medicare sample and fracture association with the use of varying ART medications among dual-eligible persons in Medicare and Medicaid datasets. Hypotheses: Fracture incidence will be greater in HIV-positive subjects compared to HIV-negative subjects.Fracture incidence will be greatest in subjects with the shortest duration of ART exposure.    ,NCT01591252

HIV,Outcomes for Antiretroviral Therapy Patients Receiving Palliative Care, Despite overwhelming need for effective HIV palliative care in sub-Saharan Africa a systematic appraisal of the literature found almost no outcome or evaluative evidence. Aim: The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of HIV palliative care training and a simple palliative care assessment tool provided to nurses of patients on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) and to evaluate this in terms of patient outcomes under clinical experimental conditions in 2 African countries using randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs. Intervention being tested: Within each well-established HIV ART clinic patients will be randomly allocated to either continue receiving standard care (control group) or to receive standard care plus appointments with a clinic nurse trained in basic palliative care (intervention group). Methods: Design: Each Phase III clinical trial (i.e. one trial in each of 2 countries) will be powered and conducted in parallel to a common research design protocol thus permitting evidence of outcomes that reflects 2 different ART providers providing evidence of palliative care efficacy relevant to different HIV care settings. Primary outcome: Each trial has been powered to a primary endpoint of pain control. Secondary outcomes: The secondary outcomes are the core domains of palliative care as defined by the WHO (i.e. physical including symptoms psychological social and spiritual) and measured by the APCA African POS. Further secondary outcomes measured will be: adherence to treatment; risk behaviours; health-related quality of life; psychological morbidity. Inclusion: Patients will be screened and invited into the trial if they are on ART score 3-5 on the 0-5 APCA African POS pain or symptom items are 18 years or older and can give informed consent to trial entry and data collection. Analysis: An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted to determine treatment response differences between the two conditions. In order to maximise the efficiency of longitudinal data multi-level modelling will be applied as appropriate.    ,NCT01608802
HIV,Hospital Visit as Opportunity for Prevention and Engagement for HIV-Infected Drug Users, Primary Objective: This study will evaluate the most effective strategy in achieving HIV virologic suppression among HIV-infected substance users recruited from the hospital setting who are randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: 1) Patient Navigator (PN); 2) Patient Navigator + Contingency Management (PN+CM); and 3) Treatment as Usual (TAU). Primary Hypothesis: The rate of viral suppression (plasma HIV viral load of <= 200 copies/mL) relative to non-suppression or all-cause mortality in the 3 study groups will differ from each other at the 12 month follow-up. Sub-hypothesis 1. The rate of virologic suppression (plasma HIV viral load of <= 200 copies/mL) in the PN+CM group will be greater than that in the TAU group. Sub-hypothesis 2. The rate of virologic suppression in the PN+CM group will be greater than that in the PN group. Sub-hypothesis 3. The rate of virologic suppression in the PN group will be greater than that in the TAU group. Secondary Objectives:   1. To evaluate the effect of the experimental interventions on: HIV virological suppression and CD4 T-cell count changes at 6 months post-randomization; engagement in HIV primary care and visit attendance; and rate of hospitalizations.   2. To evaluate the effect of the experimental interventions on: drug use frequency and severity; and drug use treatment engagement and session attendance.   3. To assess selected mechanisms of action of the intervention (.i.e. mediators of intervention effect).   4. To assess potential characteristics associated with differential treatment effectiveness (i.e. moderators of intervention effect).   5. To evaluate the incremental cost and cost-effectiveness of the interventions.    ,NCT01612169

HIV,Assisted Partner Notification to Augment HIV Treatment and Prevention in Kenya, The main purpose of this implementation science study is to find out if providing aPS at 18 different Ministry of Health (MOH) VCT clinics in Kenya works and is cost-effective. This would enable co-investigators in the Kenyan MOH to justify funding to scale-up these services. The primary aim of the study is to find out whether providing aPS to sexual partners of newly tested HIV-infected individuals can result in more sexual partners getting counseled and HIV tested and linked to HIV care programs for initiation of ART if appropriate. The investigators hypothesize that aPS will increase rates of case-finding linkages to care and ART initiation and will not result in social harm. The second aim is whether aPS is cost-effective in the Kenyan setting. The investigators will estimate how much it costs (when compared to standard methods) to identify and link HIV-infected persons into care. The investigators will also determine how successful aPS is at preventing future HIV transmission events and other outcomes associated with untreated HIV infection. The investigators hypothesize that HIV prevalence among partners in the immediate aPS arm will be high enough to make this approach cost-effective from the payer and societal perspective. Finally with the Kenya MOH the investigators want to establish a nationwide monitoring system to evaluate why Kenyans are testing for HIV. In the future when aPS is rolled out nationally this will help Kenyan public health officials define the contribution of aPS to HIV case-finding. The investigators hypothesize that the proportion of newly tested HIV-infected individuals who report testing because of known exposure to a person with HIV will represent a significant proportion of new cases and the investigators will be able to identify places in Kenya where aPS will have the greatest impact on HIV treatment and prevention.    ,NCT01616420

HIV,Etravirine Pharmacokinetics and HIV Viral Load in Breast Milk and Plasma, HIV positive pregnant women who receive potent combination antiretroviral therapy over at least the last trimester of pregnancy and who have proper obstetric interventions and are able to avoid breast feeding decrease the risk of having an infected infant to about 1%. Breast milk HIV-1 RNA (cell free) viral load is significantly associated with breast milk transmission and a 2-fold increased risk of transmission associated with every 10-fold increase in breast milk viral load has been reported. In addition cell associated virus (HIV DNA) was associated with a significant increase in risk of transmission independent of the level of cell-free viral RNA. However multiple studies of HIV positive women giving birth have shown that exclusive breast-feeding carries a much lower risk of HIV transmission than mixed breast-feeding (defined as breast milk along with complementary food other milk and/or infant formula). The proposed study will measure the antiretroviral (ARV) drug etravirine concentrations in blood and breast milk in postpartum HIV positive women on HAART therapy. The short-term goal is to determine how much etravirine penetrates into breast milk and whether it leads to undetectable HIV viral load in the breast milk and therefore has the potential to decrease the risk of transmission of HIV through breast milk. The long term goal is to see if breast milk HIV levels can be lowered sufficiently to prevent maternal to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV in infants receiving only breast feeding in resource poor areas.    ,NCT01625169

At baseline the investigators will conduct dietary interviews measure body composition randomize subjects to receive a PCS (plus micronutritional supplements [MNS]) or control (MNS only) for the 6-month duration of anti-TB therapy (ATT) plus an additional 2 mos (8 mos total). Subjects will be followed monthly and have CD4 counts at baseline 2 8 and 12 months. At 2 months (i.e. at the end of the 4 drug intensive phase of TB treatment and start of the 2 drug continuation phase) all subjects will be started on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) based on Tanzanian Ministry of Health guidelines (currently: AZT/3TC/efavirenz). The primary endpoint will be change in CD4 count after 8 months (i.e. at end of PCS/MNS intervention and 2 months after completion of ATT).    ,NCT01635153
HIV,Randomized Control Trial of Family-Based HIV Prevention for Latinos, The proposed project will test an HIV prevention intervention for Latino parent-adolescents dyads. This randomized controlled trial will:   1. Recruit and randomize 320 parent-adolescent dyads into a Latino family-based HIV prevention intervention or a family-based General Health Promotion condition.   2. Determine the efficacy of the Latino Family-based HIV prevention intervention from assessment of changes in HIV-related sexual behavior and attitudes over 18 months among a sample of 320 Latino parent-adolescent dyads.   3. Determine the efficacy of the Latino Family-based HIV prevention intervention from assessment of changes in family relationships and parental monitoring/supervision over 18 months among a sample of 320 Latino parent-adolescent dyads.   4. Examine the association of other important constructs such as religiosity acculturation cultural values and sexual socialization with the primary outcomes. Based on a thorough review of the literature and preliminary data from a recent small pilot study the investigators hypotheses are:   1. Compared to the General Health Promotion Control condition the Family-Based HIV Prevention intervention will result in greater change with regard to primary outcome measures of safer sexual behavior (recent sexual activity the number of unprotected sex acts and intentions to use condoms) and safer HIV-related attitudes.   2. Compared to the General Health Promotion Control condition the Family-Based HIV Prevention intervention will result in greater change with regard to family relationships and parental monitoring/supervision through improved parent-child communication skills and they will mediate the intervention impact.   3. Religiosity acculturation cultural values and sexual socialization will have meaningful associations with the primary outcomes and will act as moderators of intervention impact.    ,NCT01635335
HIV,Enhancing Ugandan HIV-Affected Child Development With Caregiver Training, Early childhood (up to age 5 yrs) is a period of dramatic change in the cognitive emotional social and behavioral domains; children continuously progress by observing and interacting with the world around them. In the face of economic instability and nutritional medical and educational deprivation HIV-affected very young children are the most vulnerable HIV subgroup globally because their families are often the most vulnerable with little margin for sustaining a favorable developmental milieu for the child. Through strategic caregiver interventions during this sensitive period of child neurodevelopment our study findings have the potential for positively re-directing the developmental trajectories of tens of millions of HIV-affected children globally.    ,NCT01640561
HIV,BREATHER (PENTA 16) Short-Cycle Therapy (SCT) (5 Days on/2 Days Off) in Young People With Chronic HIV-infection, The overall aim of the BREATHER trial is to evaluate the role of Short-Cycle Therapy (SCT) in the management of HIV-infected young people who have responded well to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to determine whether young people with chronic HIV infection undergoing Short-Cycle Therapy of five days on ART and two days off maintain the same level of viral load suppression as those on continuous therapy over 48 weeks. To assess the advantages and disadvantages of the strategy the incidence of toxicities immunological control resistance mutations acceptability quality of life and adherence to the randomised strategy will also be compared. Importantly because of insufficient data on short-term viral load rebound after stopping ART in this population the trial will incorporate an initial pilot phase in selected centres to assess the safety of the SCT strategy by evaluating detailed HIV-1 RNA profiles of participants on the SCT strategy.    ,NCT01641016
HIV,An HIV Intervention for Black Men at Risk - The Enhanced Sexual Health Intervention for Men (ES-HIM), HIV continues to spread among Black men who have sex with men (MSM) but few interventions target high-risk Black men who have sex with men and women (MSMW). Black MSMW with histories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) may be an especially vulnerable population for: a) high-risk sexual behaviors; b) negative psychological sequelae (e.g. depressive or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms); and c) neurobiological abnormalities in cardiovascular neuroendocrine and/or immune systems (e.g. cortisol and norepinephrine) and HIV/AIDS progression. The purpose of this study was to test an HIV risk reduction intervention guided by the Social Learning Theory the Ecological Model and the concept of allostatic load a composite of the cumulative effects of stress on biological systems including psychoneuroimmunologic markers. The investigators tested the 6-session Enhanced Sexual Health Intervention for Men (ES-HIM) on 88 non-gay identifying HIV-positive Black MSMW with histories of CSA. The outcomes were to reduce high-risk sexual behaviors (i.e. unprotected anal and vaginal sex and number of sex partners) and negative psychological symptoms of depression and PTSD. Links between these outcomes and biomarkers of stress were also explored. Randomization to either the ES-HIM or a health promotion control group occurred with study participants assessed at baseline post 3- and 6-months.    ,NCT01641146
HIV,A Couple-Based Relationship Strengthening HIV Intervention for Young Parents, This study seeks to develop implement and assess an innovative 15-session couple-based intervention to be delivered in a group format to young parents that aims to strengthen relationships and reduce HIV risk.

HIV,Mobile Phone Technology for Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV: Acceptability Effectiveness and Cost, Although gains have been made in achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDG) much is still needed in countries affected by high levels of HIV/AIDS. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) is a cornerstone strategy in reducing infant mortality from HIV. The study will employ a cluster randomized control trial (cRCT) with 26 health facilities randomized to two arms (intervention or control) to determine the effect of mobile phone technology on completion of key PMTCT milestones from antenatal to six weeks postpartum. The study will examine the acceptability effectiveness and cost of implementing a PMTCT-focused mHealth strategy among HIV-infected pregnant women health workers and male partners.    ,NCT01645865
HIV,Maternal Determinants of HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed Fetal Growth Birth Outcomes and Early Infant Growth, The purpose of this study is to understand how differences in the nutritional status and concentration of hormones and cytokines associated with cachexia in HIV+ and HIV- pregnant women living in a semi-rural and rural region of northern Tanzania affect fetal growth pregnancy outcomes and early infant health and development. The study hypothesis is that HIV+ women will have worse nutritional status and a greater degree of cachexia which will negatively impact fetal growth pregnancy outcomes and early infancy health and development.    ,NCT01647841
HIV,Daily Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or Weekly Chloroquine Among Adults on ART in Malawi, The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a benefit to taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) as prophylaxis among HIV positive adults who have viral load suppression and a good clinical response on anti-retroviral therapy (ART). If there is a benefit then is it due to antimalarial or antibacterial properties. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a long-term benefit on survival and disease control in the context of prophylaxis and that the benefit will largely be attributed to prevention of malaria. The main study hypothesis is that 1)TS and chloroquine (CQ) will decrease the rates of morbidity and mortality among adults after 6 or more months of ART and 2) CQ prophylaxis will be associated with more prolonged viral suppression and higher CD4 cell counts than TS prophylaxis or no prophylaxis.    ,NCT01650558
HIV,Impact of an Antibiotic (Rifaximin) on Liver Scarring in HIV-Infected Patients With Liver Disease, For HIV-infected patients who have access to treatment liver diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Hepatitis C is the most frequently encountered liver condition in this population. Both diseases allow a higher level of poisonous substances (toxins) normally produced by the bacteria present in the gut to enter the bloodstream. This leads to a chronic inflammatory state which results in faster development of liver scars (fibrosis) and ultimately end stage disease (cirrhosis). To prevent this from happening the use of antibiotics has been attempted to reduce the quantity of gut flora in the hopes of lowering the amount of toxins produced. These trials have shown promising results but the antibiotics studied had major side effects and were not designed for continuous use. Rifaximin is a non absorbable antibiotic with very few side effects. It is already used for long periods of time in cirrhotic patients to treat the effects of cirrhosis on the brain (encephalopathy). This project will try to determine if rifaximin by reducing the level of toxins produced by the bacteria in the gut can improve the evolution of liver fibrosis in HIV-infected patients with hepatitis C. In this pilot study ten patients with HIV and HCV infection will be followed for one year. In addition 10 patients with HCV mono infection will also be followed. Both populations will be included if they are starting on rifaximin for its currently approved FDA indication (hepatic encephalopathy).    ,NCT01654939

HIV,Clinical Outcomes in Persons With HIV Acquired Early in Life, Background: - Long-term survival with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not well understood. Adults who were infected with HIV as children have lived with the virus for many years. However the effect of HIV on this group of people has not been studied in depth. Researchers are interested in studying how HIV infection and the medicines used to treat it affect people who were infected early in life. They want to find out if there are any problems with how HIV-infected children grow and develop as adults especially if they have developed heart problems. As part of this study people with HIV will be compared with healthy volunteers. Objectives: - To study the effect of HIV infection and treatment on people who acquired HIV infection in early life. Eligibility:   -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who were infected with HIV before age 10.   -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age who have no history of heart disease. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will have regular study visits about once a year for up to 10 years to collect health information.   -  Blood and urine samples will be collected to look at kidney and liver function.   -  X-ray scans will be used to look at bone density and the amount of fat and muscle in the body.   -  Heart function tests and imaging studies including ultrasound and echocardiograms will be used to look more closely at the heart.   -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.    ,NCT01656564

HIV,EARNEST Rifabutin Pharmacokinetics (PK) Substudy," - Background and study aims? Some of the drugs used to treat HIV (anti-retrovirals or ARVs) can affect the blood levels of other drugs used to treat TB - called a ""drug-drug interaction"". The main drug used in second-line therapy Aluvia (lopinavir/ritonavir) is one of the drugs that has this effect. This is why people on second-line ARVs usually cannot use one of the main TB drugs ""rifampicin"" and instead will be prescribed a slightly different drug called ""rifabutin"" which is less affected by these drug-drug interactions. Although blood levels of rifabutin are not as badly affected by Aluvia as blood levels of rifampicin rifabutin levels in the blood are still increased a lot by taking Aluvia at the same time. This could lead to higher levels of side-effects because there is more drug in the body. So in the past doctors have suggested that instead of taking rifabutin every day with Aluvia it should only be taken three times a week on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays. However in the last 2 years new studies have suggested that this three times a week regimen might not be enough and that it may not completely cure TB. So the purpose of this study is to find out whether taking rifabutin every day with Aluvia really does lead to more side-effects and whether taking rifabutin three times a week with Aluvia really does lead to much lower levels of rifabutin in the blood. - Who can participate? This substudy is specifically for people who are already taking anti-TB drugs in EARNEST or who need to start anti-TB drugs whilst they are in the EARNEST trial. - What does the study involve? Participants will be selected (by chance chosen by a computer) to one of the following two rifabutin groups: Group 1: Rifabutin (150 mg) taken three times a week on Monday/Wednesday/Friday Group 2: Rifabutin (150 mg) taken every day On these days one capsule of rifabutin (150 mg) should be taken in the morning by mouth. Participants will be asked to attend clinic 2 and 12 weeks after entering the sub-study then every 6 weeks until the end of their TB treatment and then return to their usual EARNEST follow-up schedule. This is roughly the same visit schedule for people with TB who are usually seen more frequently than those without TB whether or not the patients join this sub-study. The 2 week visit is specifically so the investigators can make sure participants are doing OK on rifabutin and to check carefully that they don't have any side-effects. At all these visits (including the day when participants enroll into the substudy) the investigators will take an extra 10 ml (two teaspoons) of blood to do laboratory tests for side-effects of rifabutin and to measure the levels of rifabutin and other ARVs in the blood - these are called ""pharmacokinetic"" or ""PK"" studies. On the day of these visits participants should not take their dose of rifabutin until after this blood draw so the investigators can measure the lowest amount of drug likely in their blood. Instead participants should bring the rifabutin dose to clinic so that they can take it straight after the blood draw. At the visit 12 weeks after starting rifabutin participants will need to stay in clinic for a second blood draw of ~3 ml (half a teaspoon) around 4 hours after they take the rifabutin dose immediately after the first blood draw. We use this second sample to see how quickly rifabutin enters the blood. At this special visit the investigators will make sure participants are first seen as early as possible so they don't have to stay any longer than necessary for the second blood draw to be taken 4 hours later. After participants have completed their TB treatment they will stay in EARNEST until the end of the trial (144 weeks on second-line therapy). - What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? If participants are allocated to Group 1 (150 mg rifabutin three times a week) there is a risk that they may have lower levels of rifabutin in your blood and this may be less effective at treating the TB. However participants should have fewer side-effects. In contrast if participants are allocated to Group 2 (150 mg rifabutin daily) here is a risk that they may get more side-effects but the levels of rifabutin in the blood should be more than high enough to have a good chance of curing the TB. Having blood taken may cause some discomfort and/or bruising in some people. It is currently impossible to know which rifabutin regimen would be best and participants may find in years to come that they may or may not have received the best treatment.   -  Where is the study run from? 9 EARNEST sites in Uganda as follows: JCRC Kampala IDI San Raphael of St Francis Hospital (Nsambya) JCRC Mbarara JCRC Mbale JCRC Kabale JCRC Kakira JCRC Gulu   -  When is study starting and how long is it expected to run?

HIV,A Study to Assess Cerebrospinal Fluid INflammatory Markers After Addition of Maraviroc to MONotherapy Darunavir/Ritonavir - The CINAMMON Study, The purpose of the study is to investigate the possible benefits of giving the anti-HIV drug maraviroc to people who are taking darunavir/ritonavir alone for their HIV treatment. Many people successfully take only darunavir/ritonavir treatment for their HIV. However there are some concerns that this treatment may not reach some areas of the body such as the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system or CNS) as effectively as it does the bloodstream. There is already a large clinical study looking at any differences between 'conventional' HIV treatment with 3 drugs and single drug treatment with a protease inhibitor also called PI monotherapy such as darunavir/ritonavir. This includes differences in the effects on the CNS. However this study will only be finished in 2013. The investigators know that maraviroc can reach the CNS very effectively. The investigators in this study will investigate the effect of adding maraviroc to darunavir/ritonavir monotherapy by looking at levels of inflammation within the fluid that surrounds the CNS called cerebrospinal fluid or CSF. Maraviroc is a licensed drug for the treatment of HIV treatment.. It showed good results in 2 clinical studies when it was taken by people whose HIV virus had developed resistance to previous HIV treatments. This study will also investigate safety as well as monitor effectiveness when patients take maraviroc is taken on top of normal treatment of darunavir/ritonavir monotherapy. Maraviroc has been shown to be present in the fluid that surrounds the brain in people taking Maraviroc. It is not known if whether the presence of Maraviroc has any impact on brain function. Therefore this study will also investigate brain (neurocognitive) functioning with a computer test and some written tests.    ,NCT01680536

HIV,Efficacy of HIV Post-Test Support for ANC in South Africa, This is a randomized controlled intervention trial with 1500 pregnant and postpartum women to examine the efficacy of an enhanced model of ongoing post-test support for women attending antenatal and postnatal care in KwaZulu-Natal South Africa. Through the intervention the investigators will tailor voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV to the ANC setting and provide a continuum of psychosocial support for pregnant women through: (1) a standardized health education video before HIV pre-test counseling; (2) HIV pre- and post-test counseling sessions that prepare women for decisions related to testing serostatus disclosure and anti-retroviral (ARV) prophylaxis and help women plan strategies for sexual risk behavior change; (3) two additional post-test counseling sessions postpartum focusing on legal education and referral partner testing sexual risk behavior change and family planning decisions and; (4) an active referral system to post-test support groups run by a clinically trained staff psychologist and (5) an active referral system to legal services run by a lawyer at the clinic. Through this intervention trial the investigators will be testing the following hypotheses: H1: Women receiving the intervention will have significantly lower sexual risk of HIV at 14 weeks and 9-months post-partum as compared to women in the control arm. Sexual risk of HIV will be measured by: STI incidence (Trichomonas vaginalis Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia) consistent condom use unprotected sex in past 30 days and unprotected sex since delivery. H2: Women receiving the intervention will report significantly better outcomes related to prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) service uptake at 14 weeks and 9 months post-partum as compared to women in the control arm. PMTCT service uptake will be measured by acceptance of HIV VCT among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women; acceptance of ARVs adherence to national infant feeding guidelines and family planning use among HIV-positive women. H3: Women in the intervention arm will report significantly better psychosocial outcomes at 14 weeks and 9 months post-partum as compared to women in the control arm. Psychosocial outcomes will be measured by: perceived social support emotional distress and partner violence among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women.    ,NCT01683461
HIV,ER Niacin/Laropiprant Impact on Cardiovascular Markers and Atheroprogression in HIV-infected Individuals on cART, HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Large investigations support an inverse correlation between HDL-C levels and coronary heart disease. Therefore a treatment lowering HDL-C such as niacin could reduce the risk of atheroprogression not only through its benefit in terms of lipid profile but also by reducing atherosclerotic inflammation. The study aims at showing that a therapy targeting HDL-C increase in HIV-infected patients on suppressive cART has the potential for reducing subclinical atherosclerotic inflammation associated with HIV itself in HIV-individuals on cART. NILACH is a randomised multicenter double blind placebo controlled 48 weeks trial to test the effect of the newly marketed niacin/laropiprant on carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in 90 subjects.   -  Regimen 1: ER niacin/laropiprant 1g/20 mg for the first 4 weeks and 2g/40mg from week 5 to the end of the study (the titration aims to reduce adverse reactions)   -  Regimen 2: ER niacin/laropiprant placebo p.m. The primary end point is the change in mean common carotid intima-media thickness from baseline and 48 weeks compared between the niacin/laropiprant group and the placebo group. The proposed in vivo experiments should provide insights on the potential benefits of niacin treatment of cardiovascular disease in HIV patients. In addition we will be able to further clarify the role of systemic inflammatory mediators in the development of early atherosclerosis of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. Detection and treatment of non-infectious co-morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases have become essential for HIV-infected individuals exposed to lifelong antiretroviral therapy and go beyond mere management of opportunistic infections or virologic suppression.    ,NCT01683656

HIV,Evaluating a Structural and Behavioral HIV Risk Reduction Program for Black Men, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the MEN Count intervention an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case management via multiple one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day period. MEN Count was developed and pilot tested using a CBPR approach via funding from an NIH R21 in Boston MA. A more larger scale two-armed quasi-experimental controlled trial design will be used to test MEN Count among Black men recruited/enrolled from an STD clinic and other community-recruitment methods in Washington DC. Study participants (N=504) will be Black men reporting heterosexual risk for HIV [unprotected sex with a woman and 2+ female sex partners in the past 6 months] and either current unemployment or homeless in the past 6 months. To evaluate the effectiveness of MEN Count a two-armed quasi-experimental design will be conducted in which participants will receive either MEN Count or an attention comparison program similar to MEN Count in structure. We will assess program impact on reduction in number of unprotected sex episodes and incident cases of STI (Chlamydia gonorrhea syphilis) via survey and STI testing respectively at baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups. Additionally quality assurance and process evaluation efforts will be conducted to ensure high quality program adherence and delivery as well as to support program replication should the model prove effective.    ,NCT01694121
HIV,Safety Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics and Disintegration Time of Vaginal Tablets Containing Tenofovir and/or Emtricitabine, This prospective double-blinded randomized parallel cohort study will examine the genital and systemic safety pharmacokinetics (PK) pharmacodynamics (PD) disintegration and disappearance times and acceptability of four vaginal tablets: 1) Tenofovir (TFV) alone; 2) Emtricitabine (FTC) alone; 3) TFV combined with FTC; and 4) placebo. Participants will be randomized to treatment group to number of tablets to be inserted in the Single Use Phase (1 tablet or 1 tablet followed by a second tablet two hours later to mimic the BAT24 dosing regimen) and to one of four collection time points (2 4 6 or 24 hours after tablet insertion) for assessments only after the last dose of the Multiple Use Phase. In the Single Use Phase of the study the participant will insert one tablet in the clinic to estimate times to disintegration and disappearance. Those randomized to two tablets will insert a second tablet 2 hours later. In all women sample collection will occur 5 hours after the initial tablet insertion. In the Multiple Use Phase of the study participants will insert a tablet once daily for 14 days. The 1st 7th and 14th tablets will be inserted in the clinic; the remaining tablets will be inserted at home. The clinic will call the participant on day 3 of the multiple use phase to ask about any symptoms the participant may be experiencing. Each insertion in the clinic will be followed by sample collection and at Visits 4 and 6 colposcopy at the participant's assigned time point.    ,NCT01694407
HIV,Treatment of Acute HIV Infection With Quad Fixed-dose Combination (FDC) Tablet, This is a multicenter single arm 48-week open-label study of FDC ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF [Stribild] in acute HIV infection. Study sites will be members of the Duke-UNC Acute HIV Infection Study Consortium. Participants will be enrolled for 96 weeks. Clinical care and study drug (ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF) will be provided for the first 48 weeks. After week 48 clinical care but not study drug will be provided through week 96. A study participant suppressed at week 48 can continue on FDC ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF. The primary hypothesis is that once daily fixed-dose combination elvitegravir (ELV) cobicistat (COBI) emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) will rapidly reduce viral replication to <50 copies RNA/ml in participants with acute HIV infection. The secondary hypotheses to be considered are 1) virologic response rates as measured by plasma HIV RNA levels will be non-inferior or superior to a historical group of participants from the PHI cohort treated with EFV/FTC/TDF 2) compared to historical controls treated with EFV/FTC/TDF plasma HIV RNA will decrease more rapidly in PHI participants treated with ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF 3) compared to historical controls treated with EFV/FTC/TDF immune activation as measured by the proportion CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing HLA-DR and CD38+ will decrease more rapidly in PHI participants treated with ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF 4)in a subset of participants samples will be obtained from compartments such as the gastrointestinal tract and lymphoid tissues to assess changes over time in parameters such as HIV-1 RNA immunologic responses to HIV and tissue and anatomic reservoirs. We hypothesize that treatment with the ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF will demonstrate improved viral clearance in these compartments as compared to historical controls treated with EFV/FTC/TDF. 5) in a subset of participants who remain suppressed on therapy resting CD4 cells with replication-competent HIV-1 (latent reservoir) will be quantitated and compared to similar measurements in PHI participants treated with EFV/FTC/TDF. In addition we will compare these results to those measured in HIV-1 infected participants treated and 6) ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF will be well tolerated and the proportion of participants who require treatment modification will be less than that observed in participants treated with EFV/FTC/TDF.    ,NCT01694420

HIV,A Pilot Study to Assess the Feasibility of Switching Individuals Receiving Atripla With Continuing Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity to a Fixed Dose Combination of Tenofovir/Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine, The purpose of the study is to investigate the benefits of switching away from efavirenz (which patients are taking in combination with Kivexa® or as part of the combination pill Atripla®) in patients with central nervous system side effects (such as insomnia {difficulty with sleeping} bad dreams etc). The investigators in this study will investigate the effect of switching to a single tablet regimen (Eviplera®) containing tenofovir emtricitabine and rilpivirine. If patients are currently taking Atripla rilpivirine will be the only new component of the combination. Rilpivirine is a drug for HIV treatment licensed for first-line treatment. In combination with Truvada® it showed fewer side effects when compared to efavirenz in 2 other clinical studies where patients were starting HIV treatment for the first time. This study will also investigate the safety (in terms of other side effects and the routine blood tests which we ordinarily use to monitor your treatment) and monitor effectiveness your viral load and CD4 counts when you switch treatment to tenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine.    ,NCT01701882
HIV,Rifampin and Efavirenz Interactions in Older Children, Efavirenz is an essential component of HIV treatment in children aged 3 years or older on anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) treatment. However the appropriate efavirenz dose during anti-TB treatment remains unclear. Rifampin (an anti-TB drug) increases the activity of the drug metabolizing enzymes that breakdown efavirenz which may lead to low blood levels of efavirenz and treatment failure during cotreatment. The drug-to-drug interactions between the HIV and anti-TB drugs also vary between individuals based on genetic factors. This study will investigate the effects of anti-TB treatment as well as drug-gene interactions on the blood concentrations of efavirenz in children with HIV and TB infections. Such data could enhance optimization of efavirenz dosage or selection of alternate regimens in some children.    ,NCT01704144

The null hyphotesis is that there is an increased Framingham score in patients treated with LPV/r as second line treatment and in patients treated with LPV/r or EFV regimen as first line treatments.    ,NCT01705873
HIV,Rapid Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy to Promote Early HIV/AIDS Treatment in South Africa (RapIT Study), One of the most serious challenges facing antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs for HIV/AIDS in resource-constrained settings is the failure of ART-eligible patients to complete the steps required to initiate treatment. The high rate of loss to care of patients who are treatment-eligible at HIV diagnosis may be due in part to the large number of steps required between receiving an HIV diagnosis and obtaining the first dose of antiretrovirals (ARVs). In South Africa these steps usually require approximately four clinic visits over a period of 2-8 weeks before a patient can start treatment. One strategy proposed for reducing losses among those eligible for ART is to simplify and condense the steps required for starting treatment. This is now possible because new point-of-care (POC) tests for CD4 counts and tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis are available. These technologies can be combined with changes to clinic schedules to allow all steps required for ART initiation under South African guidelines (lab tests physical exam education) to take place on the day the patient presents for an HIV test. This study is a randomized strategy evaluation of the feasibility effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of rapid ART initiation. Outpatient non-pregnant HIV-positive adults who come to a South African clinic for an HIV test consent to study participation and are eligible for ART will be randomized 1:1 to rapid ART initiation or to standard care. Those who are assigned to rapid ART initiation will have the possibility of receiving their first dose of ARVs as early as the same day while those who are assigned to standard care will follow the clinic's usual procedures for starting ART. Rapid ART initiation for HIV-positive pregnant women which has recently become the standard of care in South Africa will also be assessed in a programmatic evaluation conducted alongside the randomized evaluation with a retrospective comparison group. The primary study outcome for non-pregnant adults will be remaining alive in care and virally suppressed 10 months after having a positive HIV test at the study site or making a first HIV-related visit. The primary study outcome for pregnant women will be adherence to ART until delivery. The cost effectiveness of the rapid initiation strategy will be assessed as the cost per patient achieving the primary outcome for each population.    ,NCT01710397

HIV,Safety and Immunogenicity of ChAdV63.HIVconsv and MVA.HIVconsv Candidate HIV-1 Vaccines in Recently HIV-1 Infected Individuals, The HIVconsv gene was constructed by assembling the 14 most conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome into one chimaeric protein. This gene has been inserted into 2 leading non-replicating vaccine vectors: an attenuated chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 63 (ChAdV63) and a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) to construct the ChAdV63.HIVconsv and MVA.HIVconsv HIV-1 candidate vaccines. The present study is named ChAd-MVA.HIVconsv-BCN01 and it is a phase I multicenter primary/booster therapeutic vaccination study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ChAdV63.HIVcons and MVA.HIVconsv HIV-1 vaccines delivered intramuscularly according to a 0-8 weeks or a 0-24 weeks schedule to recently HIV-1 infected individuals with early viral suppression 6 months after initiation of Tenofovir/Emtricitabine plus Raltegravir.    ,NCT01712425

HIV,A Phase IV Open-label Single-arm Study Investigating the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of the Antiretroviral Combination of Rilpivirine and Ritonavirboosted Darunavir in Therapy-naive HIV-1 Infected Patients.," For patients who are starting to take antiretroviral medication (to treat HIV) for the first time there are now a variety of different medicines which may be taken together as a combination in order to form an effective treatment which suppresses the virus for prolonged periods of time. Currently national guidelines recommend the use of two different drugs of one type (the nucleoside/ nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors NRTI often known as ""nukes"") with a third drug from one of two other types (either a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor known as an NNRTI or ""nonnuke"" or a protease inhibitor known as a PI) to form a treatment regime of three active drugs. In the UK and Europe all PIs are given in combination with a small dose of a second PI ritonavir which has the effect of boosting the levels of the active PI in the bloodstream. The investigators know from both research studies and patient experience in clinic that a combination of a ritonavirboosted PI with an NNRTI achieves similar results in suppressing the HIV virus compared to the use of either a PI or NNRTI with 2 NRTI as described above. In this study the investigators will observe the combination of two licensed antiretroviral medications ritonavirboosted darunavir(DRV/r) and rilpivirine (RPV) in suppressing virus when given to patients who are commencing treatment for HIV infection for the first time. Both of these drugs are licensed for treatment of patients with HIV in the UK and Europe and are currently in standard clinical use. The study will monitor this treatment over the first 48 weeks. The investigators will also examine the levels of both drugs in the bloodstream during the first 4 weeks of starting this regimen to confirm that they remain at levels which the investigators know to be effective against the virus.

HIV,Doxycycline for COPD in HIV-Infected Patients," In the context of improved survival from HIV infection itself chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); a form of lung disease that includes emphysema which makes breathing difficult) is emerging as an important cause of morbidity and perhaps ultimately mortality in this population. HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease likely due to multiple factors including an increased presence of smoking chronic inflammation and progression of immunodeficiency oxidant stress (excessive levels of natural chemicals called oxidants and free radicals that can damage tissue) and respiratory infections. While natural history data on COPD are limited in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy earlier data suggest that the course of emphysema may be accelerated in this population. Our preliminary data suggest that several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) derived from alveolar macrophages (a type of immune cell found in the lungs) have an increased cellular response in HIV-infected smokers which could contribute to accelerated emphysema. Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that break down the structural support of tissues including the airways in the lung. Based on these observations the investigators hypothesize that pharmacologic inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases by doxycycline will favorably modify the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in HIV-infected patients. To test this hypothesis the investigators propose conducting a proof of concept pilot study as a prelude to a possible phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial (testing safety and efficacy in a larger population controlled with a ""sugar pill"") of doxycycline for COPD in HIV-infected patients should the proof of concept be successful. Our research team is lead by a pulmonologist/researcher with expertise in HIV-associated COPD and an infectious diseases specialist/clinical trials expert.    ",NCT01744093
HIV,Mobile Phone Text Messaging Referral, The study hypothesis is that managed referral of patients at community level (from drug stores) increases uptake of reproductive health (RH) services at dispensary and health centre levels. The intervention is currently being implemented in 2 districts (Magu and Sengerema) in Mwanza Region on the northwest shore of Lake Victoria. It is nested within the IntHEC Community Randomised Trial which aims to evaluate the impact of a complex RH intervention on the uptake and integration of reproductive health services in 2 Regions in Tanzania (Mwanza and Iringa) and Niger (Say and Aguie) respectively. 18 wards per region were stratified according to geographical and economic criteria and randomly assigned to intervention or comparison wards. The SMS intervention is being implemented in 9 intervention wards in Mwanza Region only. 9 wards are followed for comparison.    ,NCT01746758
HIV,Exploring HIV Entry Blockade as a Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Strategy in Women, Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV prevention strategy in which HIV medicines are used by a person before they are exposed to HIV in order to decrease his or her chance of getting infected. In this study we will investigate a new PrEP strategy in women using a drug called maraviroc a medicine used in the treatment of HIV infection called a CCR5 antagonist. We hypothesize that maraviroc could be a particularly good drug for PrEP because it achieves high concentrations in the genital tract in women and decreases the number of HIV-susceptible cells in the genital tract and thus could potentially be dosed in more favorable ways than the current PrEP drugs. In order to further evaluate this PrEP strategy we plan to measure the amount of maraviroc in the blood and genital tract of HIV-negative healthy female volunteers before during and after they are given maraviroc dosed either in the standard (twice a day) or reduced (once a day) dose for 7 days compared with women who are not given maraviroc. We will also study immune cells from the blood and genital tract from these women to see if maravoric has an effect on these cells that would prevent them from becoming infected with HIV.    ,NCT01749566

HIV,Randomized Control Trial of Shang Ring Versus Forceps-guided Adult Male Circumcision in Southwestern Uganda., Adult male circumcision (AMC) can reduce the incidence of HIV transmission by 40-60% in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The World Health Organisation and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS advocate AMC for the reduction of HIV transmission in heterosexual men and feasibility studies have demonstrated that AMC programmes can be effectively delivered to hyperendemic communities such as those in SSA. Despite these recommendations the potential effects of AMC have been attenuated by low uptake with only 5% of all men who could benefit undergoing surgery to date. Traditional time-consuming methods of AMC that require formal surgical training limit uptake in low-income countries. Training and implementation by non-physician health providers is dampened by a need to perform approximately 100 procedures to achieve satisfactory operative time and adverse effect rates. The investigators performed a randomised controlled effectiveness study to compare the shang ring (SR) with standard forceps-guided (FG)-AMC in a publicly funded regional referral hospital with a locally trained surgeon in Mbarara western Uganda.    ,NCT01757938
HIV,Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence and Secondary Prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus, In this study investigators propose to randomize 165 human immunodeficiency virus positive patients to one of three 16-week treatment conditions: (1) standard care; (2) standard care + cell phone-based adherence reminders; or (3) standard care + cell phone-based adherence reminders and contingency management. In this latter condition patients will earn reinforcement for sending in time- and date-stamped self videos of antiretroviral therapy medication ingestion. Primary outcomes will include viral loads and self-report measures of adherence and effects will be evaluated both during the treatment period and throughout a one-year follow-up. Investigators hypothesize that the cell phone reminder condition will improve adherence relative to standard care and the cell phone reminder plus contingency management condition will have the best outcomes. Results from this study may have widespread implications for the use of cell phones as a novel technology to improve initial adherence to antiretroviral therapy thereby reducing the spread of drug resistant human immunodeficiency virus strains to the community.    ,NCT01760759

HIV,CVCTPlus: A Couples-Based Approach to Linkage to Care and ARV Adherence," Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be the most heavily-impacted risk group in the US HIV epidemic. Studies suggest that the majority of incident HIV infections among MSM are attributable to sex with a main male sex partner. However HIV prevention interventions that target male-male couples are lacking. Because of this Couples HIV Voluntary Counseling and Testing (CVCT) an intervention that has been repeatedly shown to reduce HIV transmission within heterosexual couples has been adapted to US MSM couples. Additionally novel evidence demonstrates that antiretroviral therapy (ART) not only reduces morbidity and mortality among HIV-positive persons but also serves to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to a negative partner by 96%. As adherence to ART is modifiable and levels of peer support have been shown to increase ART adherence this current study proposes to use CVCT combined with dyadic adherence counseling (""CVCTPlus"") to improve linkage to care retention in care ART adherence and viral suppression among male-male couples using a cohort of 350 serodiscordant (one HIV(+) partner one HIV(-) partner) couples in the greater Atlanta Chicago and Boston areas. Prospective couples (175 in each arm) will be followed for two years. At each visit they will receive HIV testing and both partners will complete a study survey measuring social and behavioral factors that may influence adherence such as a couple's coping ability and their concordance of agreements regarding outside sex partners. Additionally couples in the intervention arm will receive two additional sessions of Partner-STEPS.    ",NCT01772992
HIV,Palliative Care in People Living With HIV/AIDS: Integrating Into Standard of Care, Our goal is to advance palliative care with persons living with AIDS (PLWA) or life-limiting co-morbidities to decrease suffering and increase quality of life (QOL). Left without advance care planning (ACP) for end-of-life decision miscommunication and disagreements may result in families being charged with neglect or court battles over treatment choices unmet care or delivery of unnecessary or unwanted care and non-relative caregivers being dismissed (e.g. gay partners). We hope to increase families' understandings of their family member's wishes for end-of-life care to decrease conflict through the FAmily-CEntered Advance (FACE) Care Planning intervention. We will also study communication quality of life and spiritual struggle. Families will be randomized into either the Control (N=96 families) or the FACE Intervention (n=192 dyads). FACE families will meet with a trained/certified researcher for two 60-minute sessions scheduled one week apart: Session 1: The Respecting Choices Interview®; and Session 2: Completion of The Five Wishes©. Control families will also meet with a researcher for two 60-minute sessions scheduled one week apart: Session 1: Developmental History; and Session 2: Nutrition and Exercise. Questionnaires will be administered five times Baseline and at 3 6 12 and 18 month post-intervention for an average of 2 years. AIM 1. To determine the efficacy of FACE on congruence in treatment preferences between PLWA and their surrogates over time and the effect of the pattern of congruence development trajectory on healthcare utilization (i.e. distal outcomes: number of hospitalizations dialysis ER visits). Hypothesis A: Development of congruence may not be homogeneous and FACE may influence the pattern of congruence development. Hypothesis B: Different patterns of congruence development may have different effects on health care utilization. Hypothesis C: Compared to Controls FACE participants will better maintain congruence over time. AIM 2. To determine the efficacy of FACE on key components of QOL for PLWA. Hypothesis: FACE participants will increase or better maintain psychosocial QOL compared to Controls. AIM 3. To minimize health disparities in ACP between Blacks and non Blacks and identify factors associated with disparities. Hypothesis: Blacks in the FACE intervention will complete advance directives at a rate comparable to non Blacks and at significantly greater rates compared to Controls.    ,NCT01775436

HIV,Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction Study Between Raltegravir and Atorvastatin., Dyslipidemia is highly prevalent among patients with HIV infection and contributes to the increased cardiovascular disease risk in this patient population. Atorvastatin lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and is used for prevention of artherosclerotic disease. Raltegravir an HIV integrase inhibitor could be one of the preferred antiretroviral agents in HIV patients with dyslipidemia because it has a beneficial lipid profile. Theoretically no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected between atorvastatin and raltegravir. However atorvastatin and raltegravir share similar metabolic pathways which could be relevant in the occurrence of pharmacokinetic interactions. In order to be able to recommend raltegravir and atorvastatin concomitant use a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers is proposed.    ,NCT01779687

HIV,Home-based Partner Education and Testing (HOPE) Study, The purpose of this study is to investigate the impacts of home-based couple HIV-testing and counseling and male partner education on partner HIV testing and other critical maternal and infant health outcomes during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Additionally the study seeks to assess the cost-effectiveness of this approach. Involvement of men during the antenatal and postpartum period including HIV testing of male partners can have substantial benefits for women and infants. In observational studies male participation in antenatal care has been associated with increased uptake of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) interventions and more recently a study in Kenya found a significant HIV-free survival benefit for children of HIV-infected women whose male partners attended antenatal care where couple HIV testing was offered. In this study only 31% of ~450 men invited for counseling and testing came to clinic highlighting the challenges faced across sub-Saharan Africa when trying to access male partners of pregnant women. In areas of high HIV-1 prevalence high levels of male involvement may be readily achievable because home-based counseling and testing is highly acceptable and the benefits of male participation and HIV testing extend to HIV-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women and infants. Reaching out to men during pregnancy may reduce incident HIV infection and vertical transmission among these women but efforts to engage men in antenatal care in Western Kenya have thus far achieved limited success. This intervention may achieve gains beyond prevention of maternal and infant HIV-1 acquisition through identification of HIV-infected men who would otherwise not learn their status or delay treatment and by improving child health through targeted education of male partners. When administered in a home-based setting simple established interventions such as the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding have been shown to be associated with significant reductions in child mortality. Home-based approaches also lend themselves to integration with targeted interventions such as promotion of HIV testing among male partners of at-risk pregnant women. Furthermore a successful HIV testing program for male partners of pregnant women has potential to reach a large number of men who may be unaware of their HIV status or who are HIV-infected but not in care providing linkages to treatment clinics and promoting prevention interventions such as safe sex and voluntary male circumcision for those who are uninfected. In this randomized clinical trial up to 600 couples (300 in each treatment arm) will be randomized to standard antenatal care or home-based partner education and HIV testing (HOPE) as part of routine pregnancy services. Women will be enrolled at the antenatal clinic in Kisumu District Hospital Kisumu Kenya. Couples in the control group will receive the HOPE Intervention featuring home-based couple counseling and HIV testing as well as key educational messages concerning HIV prevention behaviors facility delivery exclusive breastfeeding and post-partum family planning. Women in the control arm will be invited to bring their male partners to the antenatal clinic for voluntary clinic testing and counseling. Women will be followed up at clinic visits 6-weeks and 14-weeks postpartum and again with their male partner 6-months post-partum. These follow-up visits will include questionnaires to measure uptake of HIV testing facility delivery exclusive breastfeeding and postpartum contraceptive use as well as linkage to HIV care. Cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be evaluated in order to inform future scale-up. First the investigators hypothesize that successful implementation of HOPE will result in higher uptake of male partner HIV testing couple testing and disclosure of HIV status. The investigators also hypothesize that there will be benefits to HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women and their children who will have improved uptake of interventions to improve maternal and child health. Specifically the investigators anticipate higher levels of facility delivery optimal breastfeeding practices and post-partum contraceptive use as well as increased uptake of antiretroviral treatment for HIV+ women in the intervention arm relative to the control arm. Second the investigators hypothesize that greater than 85% of HIV-1-infected men identified through home-based partner education and testing (HOPE) will access care and treatment services and overall more women in the HOPE arm will know their partners' status at each time point and more partners will be in care and treatment. Third the investigators predict that uptake of counseling and testing and HIV prevalence among male partners and family members will be high enough to make this approach cost-effective from both payer and societal perspectives.    ,NCT01784783

HIV,A Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Levonorgestrel Implant and Antiretroviral Therapy, The use of hormone contraception poses a significant challenge for the estimated 16 million HIV-infected women of childbearing age. This is due to known drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy (medicines used to treat HIV) that may jeopardize contraception effectiveness. By evaluating the impact of antiretroviral therapy on a levonorgestrel subdermal implant the most widely available hormone implant in low and middle-income countries this study will translate its findings into an evidence-based approach to co-manage these important medications. The investigators hypothesize that women receiving nevirapine or efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy will have a significant decrease in the mean levonorgestrel plasma concentration measured six months after the implant's insertion as compared to those women who are not taking antiretroviral therapy. Although the implant's efficacy may be retained initially the investigators propose that a decrease in levonorgestrel concentrations in women receiving antiretroviral therapy may jeopardize the implant's effectiveness near the end of its intended duration of use (5 years).    ,NCT01789879
HIV,Evaluating a Youth-Focused Economic Empowerment Approach to HIV Treatment Adherence, The goal of Suubi+Adherence is to examine the impact and cost associated with an innovative intervention to increase adherence to HIV treatment for HIV-infected adolescents. Multiple intervention studies by our team in Rakai and Masaka Districts of southern Uganda with AIDS-orphaned adolescents have revealed that if given an opportunity to participate in economic empowerment interventions youth and their caregivers take full advantage of these interventions to save and invest in their future show improvements in family financial outcomes future aspirations health functioning sexual-risk taking behaviors and mental health. The Suubi+Adherence study capitalizes on this prior work positing that economic empowerment may be a missing yet critical ingredient to HIV treatment adherence interventions for adolescents and young people. Suubi+Adherence incorporates an economic empowerment design with a savings-led income generating component to promote economic stability and apply it to adherence to HIV treatment regimens for HIV-positive adolescents in a region of southern Uganda with the highest HIV incidence and prevalence in the country.    ,NCT01790373
HIV,Pilot Study Evaluating the Use of Simultaneous HBV HCV and HIV Rapid Tests, This is a pilot monocentric prospective randomized control trial looking at the use of rapid tests as a part of normal care. The investigators will be testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Testing will be proposed to all persons seeking care at the Centre d'Accueil de Soins et d'Orientation from the organization Médecin du Monde (CASO MDM). Infection status of participants will be determined by either the standard test (ELISA) or rapid test. The choice between tests will be determined randomly. The overall goal is to determine the general acceptability and feasibility of rapid tests and to see if they can help individuals increase their awareness of infection status when compared to longer routine methods of testing. In addition results from these tests will allow the medical doctor to guide participants to appropriate care. All positive tests will be confirmed at a specialized hospital (Hôptial Saint-Antoine Paris France) and health-specific information will be obtained four months after testing.    ,NCT01790633
HIV,Carolina Alcohol and Drug Resources, Substance abuse is highly prevalent among individuals with HIV and associated with negative outcomes including poorer medication adherence and HIV risk behavior. The primary aim of this project is to address substance abuse among individuals with or at high-risk for HIV by enhancing and expanding the substance abuse services provided in the formerly Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) funded Carolinas Alcohol and Drug Expansion Team (CADET) program which offered comprehensive substance abuse care for individuals with HIV living primarily in the Durham NC area. Services will be enhanced by adding peer outreach and navigation services to improve treatment engagement and participation and expanded to replicate the enhanced CADET service model in Charlotte NC. The target population for this project is minority individuals primarily African-Americans with HIV or at high-risk for HIV with a particular focus on minority men who have sex with men (MSM)s. The program will provide up to 18 months of comprehensive services for approximately 315 individuals and will include: 1) peer outreach to facilitate and enhance treatment engagement 2) individual and group substance abuse treatment using evidence-based models 3) ongoing recovery groups for individuals who have completed the intensive substance abuse treatment phase and 4) linkage to needed services such as case management psychiatric care and HIV/Hepatitis medical care. We will also target HIV and Hepatitis C testing and treatment services for minority MSM of unknown HIV status to increase access and utilization of substance use services and identify HIV and Hepatitis status. The study evaluation will involve analysis of participant survey data gathered at baseline 6 12 18 months of study participation to determine the effect of the comprehensive substance abuse care services on outcomes for individuals with HIV including substance use mental health HIV treatment adherence HIV risk behavior and access and utilization of HIV services. The study will also determine the effect of the comprehensive substance use program on substance abuse mental health and risk behavior outcomes for minority MSM who are not HIV-positive.    ,NCT01791179
HIV,Enhanced Access to HIV Care for Drug Users in San Juan Puerto Rico," The overall goal of this project is to implement and evaluate a community-level structured approach to enhance HIV care access and retention for drug users in San Juan Puerto Rico. The ""Enhanced HIV Care Access and Retention Intervention"" will: 1) identify drug users living with HIV who either do not know their HIV status and/or are not engaged in HIV care; 2) provide direct HIV care services through a mobile health van; and 3) support identified HIV-infected drug users with patient navigators to enhance their ability to engage in HIV care and substance abuse treatment to initiate antiretroviral therapy and maintain adherence to their treatment regimens. The structural enhanced care approach will be evaluated through a randomized roll-out design a refinement of the stepped-wedge design. The community-level success of the intervention will be assessed by evaluating virologic suppression (primary biological outcome) increased attendance to HIV care visits uptake of antiretroviral therapy adherence to HIV treatment regimens and decreased substance use (as secondary behavioral outcomes) in an independent cohort of HIV-positive individuals drawn from each of the neighborhoods included in the intervention. We will also evaluate the implementation process and cost of the enhanced care approach including implications for cost-effectiveness feasibility of expansion and sustainability.    ",NCT01792752

HIV,The Canadian HIV Quit Smoking Trial: Tackling the Co-morbidities of Depression and Cardiovascular Disease in HIV+ Smokers, The objectives of this trial are: Primary objectives:   1. To determine among HIV+ individuals whether varenicline or NRT is more effective at helping individuals remain abstinent from smoking tobacco.   2. To determine among HIV+ individuals whether varenicline or NRT has the lowest side-effect profile.   3. To determine if the HIV tailored Quit Smoking Counselling Intervention plus smoking cessation drug therapy improves smoking cessation rates compared to smoking cessation drug therapy alone with usual care. Secondary objective: 1. To determine whether the use of varenicline/NRT is safe in HIV+ patients who exhibit depressive symptoms. Hypothesis: That varenicline will result in higher quit smoking rates and that NRT will result in a lower side effect profile. Further the HIV tailored quit smoking intervention will result in higher rates of smoking cessation over and above the pharmacological treatment alone. And finally varenicline will be safe to use for HIV + individuals who exhibit depressive symptoms.    ,NCT01800019

HIV,"The ""START"" (a Streamlined ART Initiation Strategy) Study", START is clinic-level (not individual-patient) intervention to catalyze the process of ART initiation among HIV-infected adults who meet CD4-based criteria for combination ART (e.g. adults with a CD4 T cell level < 350/ul). The three START components are: (1) real-time point-of-care CD4 testing using the Alere PIMA platform to ascertain treatment eligibility in real time at first presentation to care (2) targeted knowledge transfer (i.e. dissemination) of recent scientific evidence regarding effects rapid ART initiation on survival to front line health care workers; and 3) feedback and reporting to clinic and providers. There three components represent empirically validated steps in the PRECEED implementation model.    ,NCT01810289
HIV,Does Rosuvastatin Delay Progression of Atherosclerosis in HIV, This study is a randomised double blind placebo controlled trial comparing Rosuvastatin with placbeo in HIV positive people who are at intermediate cardiovascular risk. It is possible that HIV positive people will receive a greater benefit from statins because of their higher baseline levels of inflammation. Current Australian guidelines recommend initiation of statin therapy on the basis of cholesterol level and the presence of other risk factors for heart disease (such as diabetes) but do not take into account whether a patient is infected with HIV. This study aims to determine what benefit HIV infected people will receive from starting statin therapy earlier then currently recommended.    ,NCT01813357
HIV,HIV Test and Treat to Prevent HIV Transmission Among MSM and Transgender Women, This study will recruit men and transgender women with acute or recent HIV infection. It wil look at how HIV medicines (ART) when given very early after HIV infection affect the amount of HIV in the blood semen and rectal secretions. In addition Investigators will be using modeling studies to look at whether or not this kind of HIV treatment can decrease the risk that a man will infect a person he has sex with and to find out how failure to take medications will impact spreading the virus to other people. In this study one group will be randomized (like a coin toss) to start ART immediately (just at the time of the enrollment visit) and the other group will wait until week 24 of the study to start ART. Both groups will be followed for a total of 48 weeks and will continue to receive ART from local sources after the study is over.    ,NCT01815580

HIV,THISTLE - The HIV-HCV Silibinin Trial, Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with an estimated number of 180 million infected patients. Until 2012 the current standard of care (SOC) treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C was a 24 to 72 weeks therapy with pegylated interferon- and ribavirin (PR). In 2012 the protease-inhibitors (PI's) telaprevir and boceprevir as first directly acting HCV drugs have been approved by the local Swiss authority for hepatitis C mono-infected and HCV-HIV-co-infected individuals. However therapy success is strongly limited in null-responders (NR) to previous PR. Treatment of HCV-HIV co-infected individuals with the new PI's is accompanied by additional challenges (e.g. drug-drug interactions toxicity high pill burden). Patients with advanced fibrosis are at highest risk for decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and prompt initiation of treatment is strongly recommended. Recently data in mono-infected patients showed that in prior non responders a 12 week course of a triple therapy (TT) with telaprevir and PR followed by another 24 weeks of PR resulted in an sustained virologic response (SVR) of only 29%. In HCV-HIV co-infected non-responders with unfavourable preconditions (e.g. HCV-genotype 1 interleukin 28 B non-CC genotype advanced liver fibrosis high baseline HCV viral load) SVR after TT is even expected to be lower. These patients urgently need additional therapeutic options with the goal to eradicate HCV in order to prevent further fibrosis progression and to reduce morbidity and mortality. A promising substance in the field of drugs targeting the HCV replication is silibinin. Silibinin is the main component of silymarin an extract of the milk thistle Silybum marianum. Intravenous silibinin (iSIL) targets multiple steps in the virus life cycle and exhibits anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory anti-viral and immunomodulatory properties. iSIL inhibits the HCV NS5B polymerase activity directly or by interfering with the binding of RNA to this enzyme. In addition iSIL appears to block virus entry virus transmission and virus secretion.In 2008 Ferenci et al. for the first time reported the substantial clinical antiviral-effect of intravenous silibinin (iSIL) against HCV in PR non-responders. The administration of 20mg/kg iSIL in 20 patients led to a highly significant decrease in viral load. We intend to investigate the effect and tolerability of iSIL in HIV-HCV co-infected individuals with advanced liver fibrosis and previous non- or partial response to SOC. All included study-subjects will receive a lead-in therapy with iSIL in a dosage of 20mg/kg/day (expressed as silibinin concentration) once a day for 14 days. At the end of the THISTLE study i.e. after the day of completion of the 14-day iSIL administration (day 15) the patients will be considered for eligibility to receive standard of care. We assume that the decline in HCV viral load would substantially improve the chances of SVR as the reduction of viral load should both increase the efficacy of PR and reduce the odds of drug resistance to HCV-specific protease inhibitor.   -  Trial with medicinal product    ,NCT01816490

HIV,Social Network Intervention to Engage Out-of-Care PLH Into Treatment," Formative Research Phase (Months 1-6) The investigators will undertake qualitative formative studies to: (1) identify barriers to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and strategies currently used to engage PLH in care; (2) identify access points and ways to reach a diversity of PLH social networks; (3) gain an understanding of PLH views motivations barriers and facilitators of care entry maintenance and adherence; (4) examine the structure and segments of the PLH community in St. Petersburg; and (5) elicit input from members of the PLH community and its stakeholders concerning the planned network recruitment assessment and intervention procedures and content. The investigators will refine protocols used in their intervention pilot study based on findings of the formative research phase. Main Trial Phase (Months 7-60) Overview of the main intervention outcome trial's experimental design. The main trial is a two-arm randomized outcome study. A total of 32 sociocentric social networks of PLH will be recruited by first identifying initial seeds?always PLH who are either out-of-care or treatment nonadherent?in multiple access points that were identified in the formative phase. The investigators will then enroll three rings of HIV+ friends outward beginning with each seed. Each sociocentric network is expected to consist of approximately 16 to 18 individuals (expected n=32x18=576 participants). This estimate is based on the size and density of participants' personal networks observed in our pilot studies. Each network member will be assessed at baseline using measures to be described shortly and will receive individual motivational counseling in care and adherence. This session will ""prime"" participants to an understanding about the availability accessibility and benefits of care. Members of the 16 PLH networks randomized to the experimental condition will then receive the network intervention. Cadres of empirically identified influence leaders within each network will be identified trained and engaged to reinforce network member engagement and adherence. At 6- and 12-month followup points assessment data will again be collected to determine intervention impact on the primary and secondary outcomes.    ",NCT01825018
HIV,Prevention of HIV Infection in High-Risk Social Networks of African American Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM)," During the formative research phase investigators will undertake formative studies to locate understand and characterize high-risk social networks of African American MSM in the community; gain community participation involvement and input; and undertake interviews with key informants and community members to gain information needed to pilot test study recruitment procedures measures and intervention content. During a 4-year main outcome trial phase the investigators will enroll 24 separate sociocentric (""bounded"") social networks composed predominantly of Black MSM. Each sociocentric network will consist of the ring of friends surrounding an initial high-risk index as well as all friends surrounding persons in this second ring and then friends surrounding a successive third snowball ring of enrollees. Each 3-ring sociocentric network is expected to consist of approximately 40 unique members (n=24 networks each with 40 members = approximately 960 individual participants). All participants will be assessed at baseline to measure sexual practices substance use and other risk characteristics over the past 3 months; asked to provide biological specimens to be tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); and counseled in HIV/STD risk reduction. STDs will be treated and those with HIV will be referred for treatment. The investigators will identify the individuals in intervention condition networks with the greatest number of reciprocal interconnections and the most favorable sociometric standing in the network. These individuals--expected to constitute approximately 20% of the sociocentric network and designated as network leaders--will be recruited to attend a 9-session program that provides training and guidance in how to deliver on-going theoretically-based and culturally tailored risk reduction advice and counseling to other members within the same network. Six and 18 months following the intervention all participants will be reassessed on risk behavior and STD/HIV laboratory measures as well as measures of intervention exposure with positive STD and HIV cases respectively treated or referred to care at each assessment point. Outcome analyses will test whether there is greater reduction in high-risk sexual practices substance use associated with risky sex and HIV/STD incidence within social networks in the intervention condition. The primary trial endpoints are reductions in prevalence and frequency of unprotected anal intercourse with nonexclusive partners increased condom use and lower incidence on a composite biological measure of new HIV/STD disease during the followup period.

HIV,Transmission Reduction Intervention Project," Half or more of HIV transmission events may occur within the period of high infectivity (and often high risk behavior) that can last 11 months or more after a person is initially infected. Unfortunately neither test-and-treat intervention methods nor Acute HIV Infection projects have found effective ways to intervene against transmission during this risky ""recent infection"" period. The investigators seek to develop effective intervention techniques against HIV transmission during the recent infection period using a combination of injection- sexual- and social-network-based contact tracing methods; community alerts in the networks and venues of recent infectees; and the logic of going ""up"" and ""down"" infection chains. The investigators first Aim is to develop and evaluate ways to locate ""seeds"" defined as drug users and other people who have recently been infected. The investigators second Aim targets members of seeds' networks and people who attend their venues. The investigators will test them for acute and for recent infection and alert them to the probability that their networks contain highly-infectious members so they should reduce their risk and transmission behaviors for the next several months to minimize their chances of getting infected. This may also reduce transmission by untested people with recent infection. Community network and venue education about the need and value of supporting those with recent infection should reduce stigma. The investigators third Aim is to reduce HIV transmission and to develop new ways to evaluate ""prevention for positives"" generally as well as The investigators own success in reducing transmission. The investigators will do this using a combination of follow-up interviews and testing including of viral loads; phylogenetic techniques; and discrete event simulation modeling to assess The investigators effectiveness.

HIV,Keep It Up! 2.0: A Comparison of Two Online HIV Intervention Programs for Young Men Who Have Sex With Men, Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) account for almost 70% of HIV diagnoses among all young people in the U.S. and are alone in facing an increasing rate of infections. Because YMSM are less likely to receive relevant sexual health education in traditional settings (e.g. schools community) the Internet is a unique route of reaching and helping YMSM. The purpose of this study is to compare two different versions of an online HIV prevention program for YMSM. The study is being conducted by researchers at Northwestern University in Chicago Hunter College in New York City and Emory University in Atlanta. A total of 900 YMSM will be enrolled into this study from the clinics of community partners in Chicago New York and Atlanta. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two versions of the program. Some topics in the program include HIV facts and myths sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and condom use. All participants regardless of the program version they receive will also take at-home urine and rectal tests for the STIs chlamydia and gonorrhea. After completing the program participants will be contacted three more times over the course of a year for follow-up sessions and surveys. The research team hypothesizes that the YMSM-specific prevention program will lead to a significant reduction in the frequency of unprotected anal sex acts and new STI infections compared to the HIV knowledge program that is for a general audience. The YMSM-specific program will also lead to improvements in secondary knowledge motivation and skills outcomes. In order for the research team to measure the effectiveness of the YMSM-specific prevention program and determine if the study hypothesis is correct participants will be asked questions about themselves including questions about their sexual orientation sexual experiences health practices including drug use health knowledge and questions about their feelings and emotions. Based on this information the research team hopes to later change improve or expand the program to better address the needs of YMSM.    ,NCT01836445

HIV,A Two Way Cross Over Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study Between Raltegravir and Amlodipine in Healthy Volunteers, The purpose of the study is to look at the levels of an HIV medication (raltegravir) in the blood and how it is affected if raltegravir is taken at the same time as another medicine for high blood pressure (amlodipine). Many patients with HIV will also have high blood pressure so it is important to know which drugs for each of these conditions can be taken together without affecting how well they work individually. Over a 3 week period participants took amlodipine for 2 weeks and raltegravir for 2 weeks with the middle week being on both drugs. The investigators will look at and compare the levels of these two drugs in the blood after subjects have taken them separately and both together. This study is randomised into two groups with both study medications received by all participants in a three-period crossover pattern; randomisation determined which medication was taken first. Once randomised allocation was performed medications were administered in an open-label fashion.    ,NCT01841593

HIV,Antiretroviral Regimens Containing Raltegravir for Prophylaxis of Mother-to-child-transmission of HIV Infection, The current available antiretroviral (ARV) agents make possible a successful treatment of virtually all HIV-infected patients even those heavily experienced subjects with a history of previous failure to ARV drugs of different classes. However some problems are still present especially for specific populations like pregnant women and infants. For these groups most of currently available drugs are not used because the lack of information on safety efficacy and pharmacokinetic/dynamic behavior of ARVs drugs. The mother to child transmission (MTCT) is still a problem in certain areas of the world especially in resource-limited settings. In some settings women often present to their first antenatal care visit late in the pregnancy posing an additional problem: how to effectively treat these patients to assure they will have an undetectable viral load at the moment of delivering? Depending on the plasma viremia magnitude and viral susceptibility it can take 6 or more weeks to reduce the viral load to less than the desired 1000 copies of HIV-1 RNA / ml of plasma. To achieve this goal it would be necessary the use of a potent very efficacious ARV regimen that could provide such viral decay in a very short period. Raltegravir (RAL) the first HIV-1 integrase inhibitor is a potent and safe ARV drug. The available evidence suggest it has no genotoxic potential and promotes a rapid decline in HIV-1 plasma viremia. In addition RAL is highly active against viral strains presenting different degree of resistance to other ARV drugs. Thus RAL could be an ideal candidate to be used for prevention of MTCT for women with detectable viral load presenting late in the course of pregnancy. Another attractive point is to consider that due to the similarity between the integrase enzyme of HIV-1 and Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1); RAL could be active against HTLV-1 blocking its replication. If our hypothesis is correct the use f RAL-containing ARV regimens would reduce the MTCT of both agents. This study has the objective of evaluating the efficacy of RAL containing ARV regimens in reducing the HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load below 50 copies/ml at the end of pregnancy for late-presenters pregnant women and to compare the frequency of adverse events for women using RAL-based ARV regimens and comparators and for their babies.    ,NCT01854762
HIV,Brazilian HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Prevention for Adolescents With Mental Health Disorder, Adolescents with mental health (MH) disorders (MHD) have higher rates of HIV/STI sexual risk behaviors than those in the general population. In Brazil among youth seeking HIV testing those testing positive had more MH problems than HIV-negative youth; HIV/STI sexual risk reduction is not regularly implemented within MH care for adolescents. Our NIMH-funded RCT in Rio de Janeiro (Rio; R01MH065163; PI: Wainberg) promises to provide such intervention for adults with MHD. A comparable evidence-based HIV/STI prevention intervention for adolescents is not available in Brazil; this application targets this need. Using quantitative and qualitative methods we will explore the contextual influences on sexual risk behavior of Brazilian youth ages 13-24 with MHD to inform intervention adaptation. The investigators will then pilot-test the family-based (parent-adolescent dyad) intervention HIV STI and pregnancy prevention intervention with a sample of male and female youth age 13-24 years (n=144) with MHD who are in MH treatment in four community-based sites in preparation for the RCT.    ,NCT01854853
HIV,Monoclonal Antibody-based Multipurpose Microbicides, The purpose of this project is to explore women's thoughts opinions and ideas about vaginal products. The investigators will ask women to help design the best strategy for applying a vaginal product using a specific kind of applicator. The investigators want to identify designs that women think would be easy to prepare and insert. Women's thoughts and opinions will help researchers develop new products called microbicides that may protect against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases that are easy to use and that will be acceptable to women who use them. If researchers can make products that are easy to use and that women like to use the products will be used more often and more infections will be prevented. Women who enroll in the project will either participate in a focus group with approximately 3-7 other women or a one-on-one cognitive interview. All participants will complete a brief questionnaire. Some women may enroll in both stages. Each focus group will take approximately 1.5-2.5 hours. Group leaders will talk to women about their experiences using vaginal products and will provide participants with study products to look at and touch. All participants will be asked to come up with ideas of how to make the products easy to use and acceptable to women who use them. Group leaders will encourage discussion about the different designs. After this group leaders will talk about a specific type of microbicide and ask women about their opinions. In particular researchers and participants will talk about the language that would be best understood by women who would use these products or be in studies to evaluate them. Each cognitive interview will take approximately 1.5-2.5 hours. Each participant will be asked about different product designs and application instructions and will be asked her thoughts opinions and potential concerns about each. She will also evaluate sample language that will be used to help women understand the products and how to use them.    ,NCT01859195
HIV,Therapeutic Vaccine for HIV, Background: - In most people who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) the immune system cannot control or cure the infection. Antiretroviral therapy drugs can keep the amount of HIV virus low for a long time. However this treatment does not remove the virus from the body. In the vast majority of patients antiretroviral therapy also will not protect the body from the virus once treatment stops. Researchers want to see if therapeutic vaccination can help people with HIV. Therapeutic vaccination means giving vaccines to treat an infection that someone already has (HIV in this case). It may help the body's immune system attack the infection. This study will look at different measures of HIV infection after receiving either therapeutic vaccination or a placebo. Objectives: - To see whether therapeutic vaccination is safe and can affect how the body responds to HIV infection. Eligibility: - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have HIV and are taking antiretroviral therapy drugs. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.   -  During the screening visit and throughout the study until week 56 participants will continue to take their HIV medications.   -  Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will have the study vaccines. The other will have a placebo.   -  The first study vaccine or placebo will be given in weeks 4 12 and 36. The second study vaccine or the placebo will be given in weeks 24 and 48. Blood samples and other tests will be given at each visit.   -  After the study visit at week 56 participants will stop their HIV medications until week 72. From weeks 58 through 72 they will come in every 2 weeks for study visits; each visit will take about 1 hour to complete. These visits will look at the body s response to the vaccines and their HIV viral load. After week 72 participants will re-start their HIV medications.   -  There will be follow-up study visits from weeks 76 to 96 with blood tests and other studies.    ,NCT01859325
HIV,Pilot Study of the Effects of Exercise on Aging Among Older Persons With HIV, This pilot study will test the feasibility and acceptability of a 12 week combined aerobic and strength training intervention among persons with HIV who are age 50 or older and do not exercise frequently and its preliminary effects on aging-related outcomes . The study uses an randomized controlled trial design and is intended to lead to a larger clinical trial with long-term follow-up. The intervention incorporates small group instruction from a trainer a small wearable accelerometer to provide accurate data on physical activity and real-time feedback to participants about exercise levels. The primary outcome measure will be changes in fitness measured as change in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max). The control group will receive a comparable exercise intervention after they complete 12 weeks of observation.    ,NCT01860261
HIV,Couples HIV Counseling and Testing for Male Couples in the United States, This is a study to determine whether testing for HIV together as a couple as opposed to testing separately in acceptable to men in male couples and is a safe prevention service. Testing of couples together has been provided for decades in Africa but has never been tested in the United States. In this study male couples will be enrolled and randomly assigned to be tested together in the same room or separately. At the time of testing investigators will ask questions about how they felt about the service they received. Three months later investigators will survey the men again and determine whether they had any problems after the testing like violence in the relationship or the relationship breaking up. The main outcomes are being satisfied with the testing service and safety (lack of intimate partner violence or relationship termination). Although the study is not designed to determine if the service reduces risk behaviors for HIV transmission investigators will examine data on risks just to explore that topic. The main hypotheses are: (1) men will be at least as satisfied with couples testing as they are with individual testing; and (2) men tested as couples will not experience higher rates of intimate partner violence or relationship dissolution relative to men tested separately.    ,NCT01861210
HIV,Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health," The SEARCH study aims to test evidenced-based innovative community based interventions that lead to the elimination of HIV in rural communities in East Africa using a multi-disease approach. The first phase of the study will quantify the health economic and educational impact of early HIV diagnosis using a streamlined and immediate ART (antiretroviral therapy). This first phase will be completed in July 2017. The second phase of the study will quantify the health economic and educational impact of targeted Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) targeted HIV testing and targeted care interventions in the context of universal treatment and streamlined care. This second phase will be completed in July 2020. The study intervention is designed to improve the entire continuum of care to reduce structural barriers for all populations including those most ""at risk"".    ",NCT01864603
HIV,Rifaximin for Chronic Immune Activation in People With HIV, Background:   -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment can control the amount of virus in the blood but it does not provide a cure. The reasons why HIV treatment does not cure the infection are not well understood. HIV persists in blood cells for years even if people receive treatment for it. In addition HIV infection leads to an activated immune system which can cause other problems.   -  One theory for why HIV infection causes immune activation involves the intestinal tract. HIV infects immune cells the intestine soon after infection and damages their immune barrier. This damage lets bacteria cross into the bloodstream leading to ongoing inflammation. Even when a person with HIV feels well this chronic inflammation may affect the immune system. Researchers want to see if the antibiotic Rifaximin can reduce this inflammation. Rifaximin is designed to stay inside the digestive system so it affects only bacteria in the intestines. Objectives: - To see if Rifaximin can reduce bacteria-related inflammation in people with HIV. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have HIV infection and are taking medications to treat it. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam blood test and medical history.   -  Participants will take either Rifaximin or a placebo for 4 weeks. They will have no medication for 4 to 6 weeks and then take the other drug for 4 more weeks.   -  During the study participants will have frequent blood and urine tests. They will also provide stool samples. Liver and kidney function tests will be performed. HIV viral load (the amount of virus in the blood) will also be studied.   -  Participants will have a final follow-up visit after an additional 4 weeks.   -  Two additional tests are optional for study participants:   -  Two blood draws: one on the third day after starting Rifaximin and one on the third day after starting the placebo.   -  Up to three colonoscopies of the lower intestine and biopsies of the intestine. These studies will collect samples of the intestinal tract to look at the effects of Rifaximin in the study.    ,NCT01866826
HIV,Community-based Interventions to Increase HIV Testing and HIV Care Utilization," The purpose of this study is to conduct a cross-site evaluation of the Kaiser Permanente's Community-based Interventions to Increase HIV Testing and HIV Care Utilization Program designed to support community-based interventions to reduce the number of new HIV cases and to increase HIV care acquisition and maintenance in minority communities disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. This effort builds on the President's National Strategy for HIV Prevention and recent research documenting the importance and efficacy of ""test and treat"" and ""treatment as prevention"" approaches. Hence goals of this important and novel work will focus on the following objectives:   1. identification of HIV infection among recently infected adolescents and adults   2. improved access to HIV care particularly among newly diagnosed adolescents and adults To achieve these objectives the following outcomes are expected from grantee programs:   1. increased HIV testing among populations at risk for HIV   2. improved health care utilization among HIV infected adults and adolescents This initiative has been undertaken by Kaiser to affect HIV at a population level via community approaches to prevention intervention and care in minority communities most affected by HIV (e.g. gay African American and Latino communities). The University of California San Diego has developed and will oversee a cross-site evaluation of Kaiser grantee programs funded under this initiative. Each site will have a treatment and comparison group and will conduct follow up surveys with their participants three and six months after their interventions.    ",NCT01867177
HIV,Quantification of Immune Cells in Women Using Contraception (CHIC II), This study is being done to understand if using birth control causes changes in the immune cells within the reproductive tract (including the cervix and the lining of the uterus) of healthy women. Immune cells are important because they help prevent infections from starting and help fight infections that have started. Immune cells are also the type of cells that HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infects so understanding more about them will help to better understand how to prevent the spread of HIV. Immune cells will be studied from the reproductive tract of women who want to start using one of the following contraceptives: an oral contraceptive pill (COC) Depo-Provera (DMPA) the levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena®) the copper IUD (ParaGard®) or the etonogestrel subdermal implant (Nexplanon®).Immune cells will also be studied from the reproductive tract of women who are not using birth control and who are not at risk of pregnancy for comparison.    ,NCT01873170
HIV,Targeted Screening of At-Risk Adults for Acute HIV-1 Infection, In this research the investigators want to see if early detection of HIV infection can be improved by testing young adults who seek urgent health care from pharmacies and healthcare facilities with symptoms similar to those people get with recent HIV infection. Specific objectives:   1. What proportion of people presenting with these symptoms are HIV positive at the point of seeking urgent health care?   2. What proportion of those who test negative or where the result is unclear (one rapid test positive and one negative) at first rapid HIV testing will test positive two weeks later?   3. What is the best way (SMS phone call or home visit) to remind people to come for the second test after two weeks?   4. Will young adults who seek urgent health care for fever body pains diarrhoea or an STD from pharmacies or health facilities find it acceptable to be invited for an HIV-1 test at the time of health care seeking? Hypotheses   1. Targeted screening for AHI among patients seeking health care for symptoms compatible with AHI or sexually transmitted disease (STD) will identify AHI cases in more than 1% of those screened.   2. Intense follow-up of patients evaluated for AHI will improve rates of repeat HIV-1 testing 2-4 weeks after initial health-care seeking relative to standard practice (i.e. recommendation to return for testing on a given date).    ,NCT01876199

HIV,Randomized Trial of an HIV Navigation Program for Early Palliative Care, This study is testing a navigation program for early palliative care provided in tandem with HIV primary care for persons living with HIV (PLWH) who are at high risk or mortality and morbidity related to their co-morbid chronic conditions. Participants are enrolled for a period of 36 months with data collection at enrollment and every 9 months after for a total of 5 data collection time points. Study participants enrolled will be randomized into one of two groups: control or intervention. Control group participants will receive control calls in between survey data collection time points. Intervention group participants will participate in a Navigation Program which includes home visits and phone calls with an advanced practice nurse (APN) and licensed social worker (LSW) as well as visits / calls by a volunteer if desired. The frequency of visits / calls will be determined based on level of need (high medium or low). The specific aims of the study are to: 1) identify needs and preferences for palliative care and advance care planning for PLWH in order to tailor an existing Navigation Program for this study; 2) test the effectiveness of an HIV Navigation Program intervention on outcomes of quality of life symptom burden coping ability and advance care planning; and 3) determine if effectiveness of the HIV Navigation Program intervention differs by age gender ethnicity education income level and level of palliative care service need.    ,NCT01884389

HIV,Determining the Effect of Abacavir on Platelet Activation," HIV positive patients have a two fold increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (such as heart attacks and strokes). Cardiovascular disease appears to be due in part to both HIV and the side effects from anti-HIV medications. Abacavir (an important component of current HIV treatment regimens) is one medication shown to be associated with an increase the risk of heart attacks in some studies. The mechanism by which abacavir does this is unknown. We hypothesise that abacavir is leading to heart disease by interacting with platelets which then form blood clots within the arteries supplying the heart the subsequent blockage of the artery causing a heart attack. This study aims to determine if abacavir increases the activity (or ""stickiness"") of platelets and thus provide evidence as to how it may be promoting heart attacks. It will consist of 23 HIV positive men who currently have well controlled HIV. Participants will take abacavir for 15 days in addition to their usual anti-HIV medications. A blood sample to assess platelet activity will be taken at baseline following the 15 days of therapy (i.e. at the time of maximal abacavir effect) and again after a 28 day washout period (to determine if any effects are reversible).

HIV,Reducing HIV Stigma for African American Women, African American women account for 66% of HIV infections in women in the U.S. AIDS is a leading cause of death for African American women and African Americans have the lowest medication adherence rates compared to other groups in the U.S. One of the reasons for low medication adherence among African Americans is fear of stigma. HIV stigma has been linked to depression psychological distress poor quality of life poor medication adherence and service utilization contributing to morbidity and mortality. Research has found that stigma is a moderator to poor adherence via depressive symptoms. The current study is a randomized control trial with a time and attention control group to test the effectiveness of a stigma reduction intervention adapted for use with African American women. A total of 224 African American women will be recruited to participate in the study. Half of the women will be from Chicago Illinois (112) and the other half will be from Birmingham Alabama (112). A workshop will be held once a study site has recruited 28 women half of the women will be in the intervention group (14) and the other half will be in the control group (14). Each study site will have 4 cohorts of 28 women. The main aims of the current study are:   1. to determine the long-term effectiveness of the intervention to reduce stigma for African American women living with HIV in Chicago Illinois and Birmingham Alabama   2. to examine whether stigma reduction due to the intervention is associated with improved physical health biomarkers (CD4+ T cell count viral load) mediated by reduced psychological symptoms (depressive symptoms) improved engagement to care and improved medication adherence   3. to explore whether stigma reduction due to the intervention is moderated by location (Chicago vs. Birmingham) transmission risk factor time since diagnosis and perceived social support We expect that the multimedia workshop intervention will demonstrate effectiveness in reducing internalized stigma through an easily-disseminated method and that it will have a positive impact on medication adherence and engagement in care for African American women living with HIV.    ,NCT01893112
HIV,The Interaction of Two HIV Medications With Blood Clot Medications in Healthy Volunteers, Background: - People who have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often take several medications to control their disease. They may also need to take medicine to prevent blood clots. Taking both kinds of medicine together can cause bleeding or other problems. But this might not happen if the medications are taken at different times. Researchers will study two particular HIV drugs (ritonavir and cobicistat) and how they interact with blood clot medications. Objectives: -To understand how HIV medicine and blood clot medicine interact so doctors can choose what to prescribe for people who take both. Eligibility: - Healthy adults between 18 and 70 years old who are not on any medications. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples will be collected. Urine samples will be collected from participants who might become pregnant.   -  Participants will visit the National Institutes of Health 7 times after the screening visit. Three visits will last about 12 hours. The other 4 will last about 1 hour.   -  Participants will take a daily dose of either study medication for 22 days. They will keep a diary of medicine they take and any side effects.   -  Treatment will be monitored with blood tests over about 2 months.   -  When the study of one drug is completed the next drug study will begin with a different group of participants.    ,NCT01896622
HIV,Switch to Maraviroc + Integrase Inhibitor, This clinical study proposes to evaluate the combination of maraviroc with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (either raltegravir or dolutegravir) in antiretroviral-experienced patients to document the efficacy safety and tolerability of this combination in order to provide clinicians with a treatment regimen that minimizes the risk of metabolic complications by avoidance of NRTI/NNRTIs and PIs. The development of an alternative ART regimen which lessens the risk of metabolic complications could improve long-term adherence and reduce the risk of certain co-morbidities associated with long-term ART use. If this new combination is found to be as efficacious as the standard regimen with enhanced tolerability and improved metabolic effects there is great potential for altering the current practice of HIV medicine.    ,NCT01896921

HIV,Relaxation Depressive Symptoms Quality of Life Immunological and Virological Status in People Living With HIV: a Pilot Study, Prevalence of depression is higher in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) than among seronegative people. Depressive symptoms have been observed in up to 40% of seropositive population. Presence of depressive symptoms has a negative impact on quality of life optimal compliance of antiretroviral treatment adoption of safe sexual behaviors and on immune status and viral load. Although antidepressants and psychotherapeutic interventions -particularly those with cognitive-behavioral components??have been proven effective in decreasing depressive symptoms in PLHIV their use is limited among other causes due to misdiagnosis patient refusal possible interaction with antiretroviral treatments or unavailability in the case of psychotherapy. Furthermore identification and assessment of more accessible interventions that would decrease depressive symptoms and improve quality of life in PLHIV has become a crucial objective in the management of this chronic disease. A meta-analysis shows that relaxation is an efficient intervention to reduce depressive symptoms in people diagnosed with depression or with high levels of depressive symptoms. According to some authors relaxation an easy-to-learn and self-applied intervention proves to be a simple first line therapy capable of reducing depressive symptoms. However the amount of relaxation needed to produce an effect on depression was not established in this meta-analysis and there are no results on the effects of relaxation in people whose depressive symptoms were caused by other diseases and only a study which includes PLHIV.

HIV,Prospective HIV Chemotherapy Cohort Study, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is very successfully treated with a type of therapy called Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART). Although HAART has made a great improvement to the health and lives of all people living with HIV HAART cannot be stopped because it is not able to 'cure' or eliminate the HIV virus from all cells in the body - the remaining viruses are referred to as 'latent' or sleeping virus. As soon as the HAART treatment is stopped the virus comes back (wakes up). It is for this reason that stopping HAART treatment is not recommended. However it may be that other drugs if given with HAART could have a stronger effect on the latent virus. There is some evidence from laboratory research that suggests that some of the drugs we use to treat certain types of cancer may have an effect on the latent virus. The purpose of this research study is to use new laboratory research technology to measure the amount of 'latent' virus in people who are treated with HAART who then need to use chemotherapy treatments for cancer. We will look at whether the levels of HIV virus are reduced in patients having chemotherapy by looking at the virus levels before during and after chemotherapy treatment. We do not know very much about how HIV persists in the body despite therapy and unless new approaches are developed removal of the HIV virus from all cells in the body will not be possible.    ,NCT01902693
HIV,Male Engagement in PMTCT Services, The study employs a quasi-experimental design in 8 public health centers in southwest Uganda offering care and treatment (C&T) services. In 4 health centers a basic intervention is introduced whereby HIV/AIDS providers are trained on contraception for HIV-positive women. They are charged with counseling C&T clients on FP; offering condoms pills and injectables; and referring clients for other FP methods. In the other 4 health centers the basic intervention is introduced along with an intervention for constructive male engagement in HIV and FP services. This includes training of C&T providers on gender-based influences on health behaviors; provision of couples' HIV testing and FP counseling services; and community-based education for men to promote gender equitable norms and male participation in health services.    ,NCT01903889
HIV,Seroconversions Resistance Adverse Events and Drug Adherence Among Subjects Taking Truvada® for PrEP: A Case Control Study, This is an observational nested case control study among pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) observational or clinical studies. The study will assess level of adherence as measured by drug level and its relationship to renal and bone adverse events risk of seroconversion and resistance development in subjects taking emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (Truvada®) for PrEP. In the protocols of the parent PrEP observational or clinical studies participants will have follow-up visits on average every 3 months for evaluation of adherence HIV-1 status renal and bone adverse events and seroconversion. Adherence will be determined by the specific FTC/TDF drug level measurement(s) outlined in the parent protocol. There are two case definitions: a) One-hundred-fifty subjects who seroconvert (become HIV-1 positive) and b) any subjects who either develop a protocol-defined renal adverse event (stratified by Division of AIDS [DAIDS] grading) or have a skeletal adverse event (any fracture) while taking FTC/TDF for PrEP. Among the estimated 7000 subjects from Truvada for PrEP observational and clinical studies all cases defined as subjects who seroconvert and/or develop either renal or skeletal adverse events will be identified. Randomly chosen controls on Truvada will be selected in a 3:1 ratio from the same site with a similar treatment duration.    ,NCT01906255

HIV,Text Messaging Intervention to Improve Retention in Care and Virologic Suppression in an Urban HIV-Infected Population, Retention in care and virologic suppression are the key final steps of the HIV treatment cascade. Poor or intermittent retention has been associated with later initiation of antiretroviral therapy virologic failure and death. Regular HIV care has also been associated with a decrease in HIV transmission risk behavior. Despite the proven health and prevention benefits of consistent HIV care only 40-50% of those infected with HIV in the United States are estimated to meet current retention in care standards and even fewer - only about 25% - are estimated to be virologically suppressed. The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations provides a useful framework for understanding broad areas that may impact adherence to care and treatment. Individual-level domains include vulnerable (e.g. depression stigma) enabling (e.g. social support positive affect) and need (e.g. co-morbidities) factors and structural domains include for example features or the clinic and the provider-patient relationship. Short message service (SMS) technology represents a new and exciting tool to help retain HIV-infected patients in care and treatment. SMS interventions have been deployed successfully in support of antiretroviral adherence and virologic suppression in sub-Saharan Africa where two randomized trials have showed clear benefits. A pilot study conducted in our clinic suggests that use of SMS messages to promote adherence to care and treatment in the urban HIV-infected poor is both feasible and acceptable. The investigators believe that combining SMS technology with content-specific messages designed to impact factors highlighted in the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations can improve retention in care and virologic suppression for an urban public hospital population living with HIV thus the investigators propose the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Determine whether a behavioral theory-based SMS intervention improves virologic suppression [primary outcome] and retention in care [secondary outcome] for a vulnerable urban HIV-infected population through a randomized trial of this technology compared to SMS appointment reminders alone. Retention in care will also be analyzed as a mediator of virologic suppression. Exploratory outcomes include time to virologic suppression sustained virologic suppression emergency department utilization and antiretroviral adherence as well as levels of depression positive affect social support and empowerment. Specific Aim 2: Examine patient experiences with the SMS intervention focusing specifically on: 1) satisfaction with this technology; 2) identifying barriers to and facilitators of patient use of this technology and; 3) the preferred frequency and content of intervention messages. Specific Aim 3: Conduct cost and cost-effectiveness analyses of the SMS intervention.    ,NCT01917994
HIV,Maternal HIV: Trial to Assist Disclosure to Children, The purpose of this Collaborative R01 under Program Announcement PAR-09-153 is to conduct a full-scale trial of an intervention to assist mothers living with HIV (MLH) with disclosing their serostatus to their young age 6 - 14 year old) well children. A pilot study of the intervention has recently been completed (R01 MH077493) and met its major aims. The basis for development of the pilot intervention was work from three R01s (MH057207 currently Yr. 14) designed to longitudinally assess MLH and their children. Within that work several studies were conducted on maternal disclosure suggesting disclosure is difficult and outcomes for MLH and children could be improved by intervention. The pilot study known in the community as Teaching Raising And Communicating with Kids (TRACK) was based on integrative disclosure theory. Results of the pilot trial indicate that those in the intervention group were six times more likely to disclose their HIV/AIDS status to their child than those in the control group (O.R. 6.33); by the 9-month follow-up 33% of intervention MLH disclosed compared to only 7.3% of the control group. Perhaps more importantly the intervention group's emotional functioning and their satisfaction improved significantly following the intervention compared to the control group. Similarly child mental health indicators among children of intervention MLH were significantly better than control group children at follow-ups. In this study TRACK II we propose to conduct a full-scale trial of the intervention in two sites: (1) Los Angeles county (Site 1 where the pilot trial was conducted) which will include a high proportion of Latina families and a smaller proportion of African-American and White families; and (2) Atlanta Georgia (Site 2 where the primary consultant on the pilot trial conducts research) which will include a high proportion of Southern African-American families as well as White families. MLH and their children (N = 440 total; 110 mothers and 110 children per site n = 220 per site) will be assessed at baseline and at 3 9 and 15-month follow-ups. MLH will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control. Aims are to:   1. facilitate disclosure of the mothers' HIV status to the children which will include secondary aims of:   1. increasing mothers' self-efficacy to disclose and respond to child questions regarding HIV;   2. reducing mothers' fears regarding disclosure and stigma;   3. improving maternal knowledge of child development and how to provide appropriate levels of information given the age of the child;   2. improve MLH mental health indicators over time (i.e. depression anxiety quality of life);   3. improve child mental health indicators over time (i.e. depression anxiety acting out behaviors); and   4. improve family functioning indicators (e.g. cohesion perceived closeness between mother and child).    ,NCT01922206

HIV,ENhance Initiation and Retention in Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) Care for HIV Study (ENRICH Study), The purpose of the ENRICH study is to evaluate a combination intervention package (CIP) designed to improve implementation of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Ethiopia. The study is a two-arm cluster randomized trial randomized at the HIV clinic level which includes 10 HIV clinics in Dire Dawa and Harari Ethiopia. Clinics are randomized to deliver the combination intervention package (CIP) or standard of care (SOC) with stratification by facility size (<80 or >80 patients enrolled in HIV care per year). The experimental intervention will be delivered to all patients in HIV clinics randomly assigned to CIP who initiated HIV care at the CIP site on or after January 1 2013 and initiated IPT on or after date of study initiation July 1 2013. In HIV clinics assigned to SOC usual care procedures for provision of IPT will be delivered. Study Aims and Hypotheses Aim 1. Characterize and compare the effectiveness of a combination intervention package with standard of care for IPT provision in Ethiopia. Hypothesis 1.1: IPT initiation for new patients enrolling in HIV care at CIP clinics will be higher than that for newly enrolled patients at SOC clinics. Hypothesis 1.2: Adherence to and completion of IPT for participants initiating IPT at CIP clinics will be higher than that for those initiating IPT at SOC clinics. Aim 1a. Assess acceptability of CIP among participants enrolled in HIV care and healthcare providers at CIP clinics. Acceptability will include: 1) perceived barriers and facilitators of uptake and delivery of the intervention package among healthcare providers and 2) acceptability and utilization of intervention components as well as the overall intervention package among IPT initiators and non-initiators. Aim 2. Assess the impact of CIP compared with SOC on HIV-related outcomes. Hypothesis 2: HIV-related outcomes for participants receiving IPT at CIP clinics will be superior to outcomes in participants receiving care at SOC clinics. HIV-related outcomes to be assessed include retention in care and among those participants receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence to ART and CD4+ count. Aim 3. Assess the safety and tolerability of IPT among HIV-infected individuals under routine program conditions in Ethiopia. Aim 4. Identify patient and program characteristics associated with IPT adherence and completion at SOC sites. Hypothesis 4.1: IPT adherence and completion will be associated with modifiable patient characteristics including ART status; knowledge and attitudes about IPT; and social support. Hypothesis 4.2: IPT adherence and completion will be associated with modifiable program characteristics including provider/patient ratio patient tracking and patient support groups.    ,NCT01926379

HIV,Strategies to Optimize Antiretroviral Therapy Services for Maternal & Child Health: the MCH-ART Study, The purpose of this study is to understand how to improve health care services for HIV-positive women during their pregnancy and after delivery. The study's aim is to compare two different ways of providing antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women with HIV. The study is to be conducted at the Gugulethu Midwife Obstetric Unit (MOU) in Cape Town. There are three phases of the study: Phase 1 is a cross-sectional evaluation of consecutive HIV-infected pregnant women attending their first antenatal clinic visit (n=1600); Phase 2 is an observational cohort that will follow women from Phase 1 who are eligible for ART (n=600) from the second antenatal clinic visit until the first postpartum visit; Phase 3 is a randomized trial of women from Phase 2 who are breastfeeding and will compare two different service models for delivering ART to women after they delivery their babies (n=480). For Phase 3 women who are taking ART will randomly be assigned to either (1) referral to receive ART at the nearest adult clinic at 4-8 weeks after delivery (this is currently how all women receive care in this setting) or (2) to continue to come to the antenatal clinic for ART services until the end of breastfeeding. All women will received the standard local ART services (with identical medications and medical treatment); they are different because some women will stay longer in care at the antenatal clinic. All women participating in Phase 3 will be followed through at least 2 months after they deliver.    ,NCT01933477

HIV,The Impact of Mentor Mothers on PMTCT Service Outcomes in Nigeria, Nigeria has significant challenges in the delivery and coverage of PMTCT (Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV) services. Only 30% of pregnant women living with HIV are provided anti-retroviral drugs for PMTCT. Less than 10% of HIV-exposed infants receive HIV testing for early diagnosis by age 2 months. Furthermore an unacceptably high number of women with HIV who are enrolled in PMTCT programs do not complete them. In other words uptake and retention in PMTCT programs in Nigeria is not adequate. Ultimately mother-to-child transmission of HIV is high resulting in a high number of new child HIV infections. Mentor Mothers (MMs) are women living with HIV who provide peer support to other HIV-positive women. MM programs have been incorporated into PMTCT programs in several African countries with some success but with varying levels of MM training and program structure. The MoMent (MOther MENTor) study investigates whether highly-structured MM programs will further improve uptake and successful completion of PMTCT services (eg testing and appointments) in Nigeria. The study also evaluates the impact of structured MM programs on other outcomes including facility deliveries new infant HIV infections infant survival and maternal viral suppression. Rural areas are the focus of this study because of their particularly poor performance in PMTCT coverage and outcomes.    ,NCT01936753

HIV,Patient-Centered Disclosure Intervention for HIV-Infected Children, In the resource-limited settings where most HIV-infected children live neither the most effective strategies to inform children of their HIV status nor the impact of disclosure is well understood. This team's long-term goal is to provide evidence to improve the chronic disease management of HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a patient-centered intervention guiding disclosure to HIV-infected Kenyan children using a randomized trial comparing the intervention to routine care. The primary endpoint will be probability of disclosure among children with secondary endpoints of adherence clinical outcomes psychological distress and social outcomes. This work will be done within the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) which currently cares for almost 120000 adult and pediatric HIV-infected patients in 25 clinics in Kenya. We will utilize the excellent infrastructure of this academic partnership to provide the first comprehensive assessment of the physical psychological and social impact of disclosure for HIV-infected children in East Africa. We will evaluate the impact of an intensive disclosure intervention by pursuing these specific aims: Aim 1: Expand and modify an existing pediatric HIV disclosure intervention used in Kenya to include patient-centered components; Aim 2: Perform a randomized trial to compare the impact of clinic implementation of the culturally adapted pediatric disclosure intervention on the prevalence of disclosure and on the medical psychological and social outcomes for HIV-infected Kenyan children ages 10-15 years compared to children exposed to standard clinical care. The usual care control arm will have disclosure training for all clinicians disclosure chart materials and an existing protocol to implement disclosure for patients over 10 years. The disclosure intervention will consist of patient-centered materials to guide disclosure including videotaped narratives; disclosure counselors; post-disclosure child support groups; and the usual care resources. The central hypothesis is that an intensive disclosure intervention based on culture-specific qualitative work and a patient-centered approach will allow for disclosure in which more children know their HIV status at younger ages and they also have improved medication adherence improved medical outcomes unimpaired psychological outcomes and no increase in experienced stigma over time.    ,NCT01947764
HIV,Vertical Transmission Study, Short courses of drugs can be given to HIV-infected pregnant women to reduce the chance of HIV infection being passed to her child either during pregnancy or during the labour process. However children can also become infected by drinking the mother's breastmilk which contains the HIV virus. In many poor developing countries in Africa breastfeeding is the normal way of infant feeding and is vitally important because of the protection it gives to children from other diseases such as diarrhoea and malnutrition. Ideally there would be a way to make breastfeeding safer from HIV transmission without losing its other advantages. A medical study recently suggested that HIV-infected women who exclusively breastfed their children i.e. gave breastmilk but without any water tea formula milk or any solid foods did not pass on the virus to their children to the same degree as women who MBF with these other fluids and foods. It is important to confirm whether this observation is in fact true or not. We hypothesize that exclusive breastfeeding by HIV-infected mothers carries a lower risk of HIV transmission than mixed breastfeeding. We propose to follow 2100 HIV-infected pregnant women and also some HIV-uninfected women from the time that they book at the clinic until 24 months of age. HIV-infected women who say they intend to breastfeed and all the HIV-uninfected women will be visited at their homes by breastfeeding counsellors both before and after delivery to support exclusive breastfeeding. HIV-infected women who choose not to breastfeed will be helped by clinic staff to safely replace all breastmilk with some other milk. An independent team will visit all mothers at their homes and collect information about the way they feed their children. Blood samples will be collected from the children at different times by a simple heel prick and the blood stored on a piece of filter paper. By testing these samples and comparing with the type of feeding at that time we will be able to see when a child becomes infected and whether exclusive breastfeeding gives any protection.    ,NCT01948557
HIV,mHealth Intervention Supporting HIV Treatment Adherence and Retention, Despite advances in antiretroviral treatment (ART) over the past 10 years the incidence of HIV in the United States remains stagnant with over 50000 new cases annually. HIV-infected individuals inconsistently engaged with care are less likely to receive ART which is associated with correspondingly adverse clinical outcomes in the long term and increased risk of transmission. Mobile health (mHealth) strategies including cell phone and text messaging have shown success in the developing world for medication adherence yet mHealth interventions have not been developed to improve retention in HIV care. This strategy needs to be tested to demonstrate feasibility acceptability and preliminary effectiveness in supporting HIV treatment adherence in Rhode Island. The Miriam Hospital Immunology Center is an urban HIV-clinic that provides comprehensive primary and specialty care for over 1400 HIV-infected patients. It is the largest HIV clinic in Rhode Island with patients also referred from eastern Connecticut and southern Massachusetts. In 2010 there were 165 new patients in clinic 70 of whom were diagnosed within 1 year of entering care. In this environment we propose a pilot study with the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To pilot a bidirectional mHealth intervention among individuals at high risk of loss to follow-up including those with a recent HIV diagnosis or those re-engaging in HIV care. HIV-infected persons (n=30) with a recent diagnosis or re-engaging in care at the Immunology Center at TMH will be recruited to participate in a bidirectional mHealth intervention that delivers automated regularly scheduled appointment and medication adherence reminders in an individualized format and also allows individuals to request motivational enhancement and problem-solving support to address barriers to care. Specific Aim 2: To assess the impact and acceptability of the pilot intervention through qualitative interviews. All participants will also be invited to complete individual in-depth interviews which will assess acceptability and effectiveness of the pilot mHealth intervention such as content and frequency of automatic messages for retention and medication adherence for HIV-infected individuals in RI. The results of this study will provide preliminary data to inform an R21 or R34 application to determine efficacy of an mHealth intervention among HIV-infected persons at high-risk for loss to follow-up.    ,NCT01951092

HIV,Comparing Food and Cash Assistance for HIV-Positive Men and Women on Antiretroviral Therapy in Tanzania, The importance of good nutrition and food security among people living with HIV infection (PLHIV) is widely recognized. In resource-constrained settings food insecurity is increasingly recognized as an important barrier to retention in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). However there are few studies demonstrating that food and nutrition assistance programs can improve HIV-related outcomes. This study will address this gap by comparing the effectiveness of three models for short-term support for PLHIV. Food insecure women and men on ART will be randomized into one of three groups: 1) nutrition assessment and counseling (NAC) alone 2) NAC plus food assistance or 3) NAC plus cash transfers. The investigators will compare the effect of the three approaches on ART adherence and retention in care after 6 and 12 months of follow-up. The investigators hypothesize that NAC plus short-term support in the form of food or cash assistance will result in better adherence to ART and retention in care than NAC alone and that the effects of NAC plus food assistance will be the same as NAC plus cash assistance. The results from the study will provide evidence about which assistance modalities for PLHIV work best to improve ART adherence and retention in care and under what conditions. This study will be conducted in Shinyanga Region Tanzania where approximately 17 percent of households have poor or borderline food consumption and 7.4 percent of people are living with HIV infection.    ,NCT01957917

HIV,Smoking Cessation for People Living With HIV/AIDS, In this proposed study with People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) we will use a stepped care model called a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to examine the efficacy of low- and high-intensity smoking cessation treatments for nicotine dependent PLWHA that incorporate the current standard of care and prize-based contingency management. Intervention will be administered in a community-based HIV integrated care clinic in downtown Detroit which has the highest prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS and smoking in Michigan. Phase 1 will last 4 weeks and will involve brief intervention to help participants stop smoking. For phase 2 participants will be assigned to different study arms depending on whether they are Responders (reduced their smoking) or Non-responders (continued to smoke).   1. Phase 1: We hypothesize that brief high-magnitude prize contingency management will result in greater reduction in smoking than standard of care alone.   2. Phase 2a: We hypothesize that non-responders who are assigned to contingency management will be more likely to reduce their smoking throughout treatment and to abstain from smoking at all follow-up points.   3. Phase 2b: We hypothesize that responders who are assigned to monitoring and low-magnitude prize contingency management will be more likely to maintain their reduced or abstinent smoking status at all follow-up time-points.    ,NCT01965405

HIV,Efficacy of Tenofovir Alafenamide Versus Placebo Added to a Failing Regimen Followed by Treatment With Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide Plus Atazanavir in HIV-1 Positive Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced Adults, Part 1 consists of 2 cohorts starting with a sentinel cohort in which 10 participants will be enrolled to receive open-label tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) in addition to their current failing antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. This cohort will then be followed by a randomized double-blind cohort to compare the addition of TAF or placebo-to-match TAF in HIV-1 positive adults who are failing their current ARV regimen. This randomized cohort will consist of approximately 90 participants. In Part 2 all participants who complete Part 1 of the study will discontinue their failing ARV regimen and TAF or placebo-to-match TAF for a 14-day washout period. Following the washout period all participants who received TAF in Part 1 and have a > 0.5 log10 decline in HIV-1 RNA will receive elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide single-tablet regimen (E/C/F/TAF STR) plus atazanavir (ATV) once daily for 48 weeks. Participants who received TAF who have a ??0.5 log10 decline in HIV-1 RNA will be discontinued from the study and will not be eligible to continue into Part 2 of the study.

Thirty (30) treatment-naïve HIV-infected adults initiating eligible first-line ART regimens will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of the following three arms:   1. no bone anti-resorptive therapy (standard of care)   2. concomitant initiation of a 24 week course of co-formulated alendronate/vitamin D;   3. a 24 week delay in initiation of a 24 week course of alendronate/vitamin D Assessments (including clinical evaluation questionnaires adherence basic laboratory evaluation and BMD measurement) will be performed at baseline 24 and 48 weeks. The primary objective will involve calculation of ? and ? using all data; δ will be estimated by comparing the two alendronate arms pooled to the no-treatment arm.    ,NCT01968850
HIV,Comparing the Effectiveness of Two Alcohol+Adherence Interventions for HIV+ Youth," Alcohol use among persons with HIV exacerbates health problems and accelerates HIV disease progression. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the single most important treatment for people living with HIV. However ART adherence is suboptimal among adolescents and young adults living with HIV the age group with the fastest growing rates of HIV infection and great risk of engaging in risky behaviors such as alcohol use. The proposed study will compare the effectiveness of home-based versus clinic-based ""Healthy Choices"" a brief 4- session intervention using Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) to address alcohol use medication adherence and health outcomes in youth living with HIV (YLH) using a repeated measures design. Unlike previous trials Healthy Choices will be tested in a ""real world"" clinical setting and be delivered by community health workers (CHW: already members of the HIV care team). The study population will consist of YLH ages 16-24 who are current patients at 5 ATN sites. Site staff will recruit potential participants. Youth will be randomized to receive Healthy Choices either clinic-based or home-based delivered by the same CHW in both conditions. Outcomes are measured at baseline 4- 7- and 13-months. Data collection for biological measures will be through medical record extraction and self-reported measures will occur using a brief Web-based CASI (computer-administered self-interviewing) survey on an iPad. All intervention sessions will be audio-recorded for MITI fidelity coding and investigators will support local supervisors during the active intervention phase. We will conduct qualitative interviews with CHWs supervisors and organization leaders at the end of the trial to obtain information about barriers and facilitators of implementation. Thus the proposed trial will allow us to use a Type 1 Effectiveness-implementation hybrid design to pilot a sustainable model of MI implementation in real-world youth care settings towards the goals of 1) examining the effectiveness cost-effectiveness and scalability of an efficacious behavioral intervention when delivered by CHWs in real-world adolescent HIV care settings; 2) gathering information about who responds under what contexts; and 3) increasing our understanding of the barriers and facilitators for future implementation. The primary hypothesis is that YLH receiving home-based MET will have greater improvements in alcohol use and viral load than YLH receiving clinic-based MET.    ",NCT01969461
HIV,Advancing Community Level Action for Improving MCH/PMTCT, The goal of the ACCLAIM (Advancing Community-Level Action for Improving MCH/PMTCT) project is to increase community demand for uptake of and retention in Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and/Prevention of Mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services to improve country progress toward elimination of pediatric HIV/AIDS.    ,NCT01971710
HIV,HIV-related Accelerated Aging of the Airway Epithelium, In cigarette smokers that are HIV+ one of the most common HIV-associated non-AIDS conditions is the accelerated development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) a disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Based on the knowledge that COPD in smokers starts in the small airway epithelium this study is focused on examining the hypothesis that the accelerated development of COPD associated with HIV infection results in part from an interaction of HIV directly on the small airway epithelium or through infection of cellular components of the immune system with mediators released by these immune cells evoking premature biologic aging of the small airway epithelium. By identifying the early events in the pathogenesis of the HIV-associated accelerated COPD in smokers we aim to identify biologic targets to which pharmacologic therapies could be addressed.    ,NCT01974219
HIV,Advanced Neuroimaging Evaluation of the Central Nervous System Biological Changes Associated With Efavirenz Therapy Switch to an Raltegravir-based Regimen, In this study investigators will use a multi-modal imaging approach of MRS and fMRI to comprehensively assess the biological changes in the brain associated with EFV-based regimen (EFV/FTC/TDF) specifically alterations in the brain circuitry function and local neurochemistry and their correlation with neuropsychological function. In a cohort of HIV-infected patients who are clinically stable on the commonly use regimen of EFV/emtricitabine (FTC)/truvada (TDF) or Atripla investigators propose to replace the EFV component with an integrase inhibitor Raltegravir (RAL) given as the RAL and FTC/TDF to evaluate the EFV-related neural alterations. This is a multidisciplinary study which will be lead by Dr. Nina Lin in collaboration with the research teams of Dr. Alexander Lin Director of the Center for Clinical Spectroscopy and Dr. Emily Stern Director of the Functional Neuroimaging Laboratory both members of the Brigham and Women's Department of Radiology at Harvard Medical School as well as Dr. Jane Epstein a researcher in Dr. Stern's research group. Dr. Epstein is a staff psychiatrist at Brigham and Women's hospital with extensive experience and expertise in research on abnormalities of affective and motivational processing in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders. Investigators will utilize the established clinical research platform in the Infectious Disease outpatient clinical practice at the Brigham and Women's Hospital where there is currently have many ongoing HIV-related studies and a large panel of HIV-infected patients motivated to be involved in clinically relevant research. Investigators propose to use advanced neuroimaging to measure biologically changes in the brain associated with long-term EFV use with the following specific aims:   1. Determine changes in neurometabolites measured by MRS in the brain associated with long-term EFV use   2. Assess for alterations in neural activity correlated with affective symptoms associated with EFV vs RAL use using fMRI and their associations with changes in neurometabolites assessed by MRS and with changes in cognition assessed by Trail Making and Digit Substitution Tests.   3. Determine changes in emotion cognition and sleep quality after switching from EFV to RAL and how they correlate with subject treatment preference. This clinical study will extend our current understanding of EFV neurotoxicity by further defining the nature of these biological changes. Further elucidation of the neurobiological underpinnings of EFV-induced CNS toxicity will have clinical relevance in improving the quality of life and drug adherence of HIV-infected patients on ART especially among older patients or those with baseline neuropsychiatric disorders whom at baseline are more vulnerable to neurocognitive decline from long-term HIV infection.    ,NCT01978743
HIV,Pharmacokinetic Drug-drug Interaction Study Between RaltEgravir and CITALopram in Healthy Subjects (RECITAL)., Depression is the most common mental health disorder among HIV-patients. Recognizing and treating depression is important in order to improve quality of life and health outcomes in those living with HIV. In clinical practice selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used most frequently in HIV patients with depressive symptoms. A complicating factor in the concomitant use of antiretroviral agents and antidepressant therapy is the occurrence of drug-drug interactions. Citalopram can be seen as one of the preferred SSRIs in HIV-infected patients because citalopram has a relatively favourable drug interaction profile compared to other SSRIs. Raltegravir is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor and is frequently being used as antiretroviral agent in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine in HIV-patients. Raltegravir has shown sustained antiretroviral activity is generally well tolerated and has little propensity to interact with other drugs because it does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes. Theoretically no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected between raltegravir and citalopram as raltegravir is not a CYP2D6 substrate and thus will not be affected by the possible inhibition of CYP2D6 by citalopram. Raltegravir is metabolized by UGT but citalopram is not known to influence UGT. A possible interaction may occur through inhibition of P-gp mediated transport of raltegravir by citalopram. However even when no drug interaction is expected theoretically it may be recommended to collect sufficient clinical evidence to support this hypothesis because unexpected interactions with raltegravir have been observed in the past. In order to be able to recommend raltegravir and citalopram concomitant use a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers is proposed.    ,NCT01978782
HIV,Barbershop Talk: HIV Prevention for African American Heterosexual Men, This program utilizes a community-engaged research approach to implementing and evaluating a program that seeks to reduce sexual risk behavior among Black adult heterosexual men.

HIV,A Phase I Trial to Assess the Safety of Tenofovir Gel and Film Formulations: FAME 04, This is a Phase I five arm single site randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial assessing the safety of tenofovir vaginal gel and film formulations. HIV negative women will be randomized to gel or film tenofovir or placebo. This study will provide additional information in the evaluation of vaginal films containing microbial agents in humans. In addition to safety the efficacy of these formulations against HIV in an ex vivo biopsy challenge model will be compared. This study is the first study assessing the safety of tenofovir film in humans. Tenofovir film is formulated in a cellulose based vaginal film containing hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) E5 (5 cp) hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) and glycerin. The excipients of the film have documented safety in other clinical settings. While the tenofovir film has not been studied extensively in preclinical studies there are favorable safety data from the macaque study and a substantial body of research with tenofovir gel. It is appropriate to advance the tenofovir film products into a clinical trial for the following reasons:   -  No safety concerns were note in the tenofovir film macaque trial.   -  The toxicity of tenofovir administered vaginally has been studied extensively. No clinically significant toxicity associated with this route of administration has been observed to date.   -  All of the active ingredients of the tenofovir film have been tested in pre-clinical toxicity studies; therefore the influence of these ingredients on the toxicity profile of tenofovir has been adequately evaluated and has been shown to result in no local or systemic effects.   -  The individual components of the tenofovir film have been adequately evaluated and have been shown to be safe.    ,NCT01989663
HIV,Expansion to Interdisciplinary HIV Prevention in Women, This trial will pilot test intervention strategies to increase utilization of HIV testing and gain knowledge for designing a clinical trial to evaluate prevention strategies to reduce HIV sexual transmission in the general population in Russia. The study will assess whether external (cost convenience) or internal factors (low perception of own risk reluctance to identify a partner as at-risk fear of stigma) drive Russian women's reluctance to be tested and if peer support impacts their decision. A randomized experimental manipulation comparing opt-in vs. bundled opt-out testing approaches followed by focus group discussions followed by a second-chance testing offer will be used to inform these questions. The answers will enable the international research team to engineer and then test an HIV testing promotion strategy in Russia. The project will collect preliminary data for a larger study to develop an evidence-based program to reduce the HIV transmission in this high risk population.    ,NCT01994603
HIV,Care4Today v2.0 Application for Improving Adherence to HIV Medications," Although poor antiretroviral (ART) adherence in HIV does not mean a complete lack of therapeutic results the benefit of ART increases as adherence improves. Consequences of suboptimal ART adherence are viral rebound development of drug-resistant HIV strains and more rapid progression to AIDS. Moreover HIV-infected persons tend to have numerous co-occurring conditions and therefore take many medications making adherence to multiple drug regimens more difficult. A mobile application capable of improving medication adherence among HIV-infected persons would be highly useful. The investigators propose an intervention study designed to address these potential mechanisms of nonadherence by utilizing the Care4Today v2.0 smartphone application (app). The current study is a small pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) comparing the smart phone application titled ""Care4Today v2.0"" versus standard of care to improve medication adherence to ART over a 4-week period with 60 HIV+ participants. The pilot RCT consists of 60 HIV+ persons who are at risk for ART medication nonadherence. Using random assignment 30 HIV+ participants will be assigned to medication adherence improvement via ""Care4Today"" app as compared to 30 HIV+ participants assigned standard of care. The investigators will assess the effectiveness and acceptability of the app in improving objectively measured ART adherence (i.e. via medication event monitoring system caps) over a 4-week period via a pilot RCT with 30 HIV+ persons assigned to the Care4Today intervention and 30 HIV+ persons assigned to standard of care.

All participants will be asked to have rectal biopsy samples (week 0 and week 32) to study T cell immune activation in the mucosa rectal site.    ,NCT02004314
HIV,Engaging HIV Patients in Primary Care by Promoting Acceptance, Engagement in primary care for People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is a significant public health concern because reduced commitment to care puts PLWHA at risk for illness progression death and transmission of HIV to others. This project will develop a novel treatment brief acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT) to promote self-acceptance of HIV status as a pathway to reducing engagement barriers. The clinical and public health impact of this project will be the development of a simple low-cost disseminable intervention that enhances longitudinal commitment to care so PLWHA can obtain effective medical treatments that will prolong survival and improve quality of life. We hypothesize that individuals randomized to brief ABBT will showed increased longitudinal attendance of primary care appointments.    ,NCT02004457

HIV,Mechanisms of Impaired HIV-associated B Cell and Pneumococcal Vaccine Responses, HIV infection is complicated by high rates of infections and cancers which are often the cause of death rather than the HIV/AIDS virus itself. Treatment of HIV with antiretroviral medications has decreased the frequency of many complications by over 90% but bacterial pneumonia remains extremely high. Current vaccines are not very effective in preventing these infections in patients with HIV infection. The investigators are studying the cells (B cells) that make antibodies to fight infection by binding to and killing bacteria. The goal is to understand how HIV impairs the ability of B cells to make antibodies in sufficient quantity and of sufficient quality to protect patients with HIV to learn how to enhance protection against these infections. The investigators also seek to understand the role of the bacteria (specifically Streptococcus pneumoniae) that normally live in the nose and throat in the development of pneumonia and other infections.    ,NCT02012309

HIV,Niacin on Immune Activation : a Proof-of-concept Study, There are a number of powerful anti-HIV drugs which keep the virus at undetectable levels and enable HIV-infected individuals to live longer. However some participants taking anti-HIV drugs do not achieve an adequate CD4 recovery and remain at risk for developing AIDS and non-AIDS-related complications. ER niacin (PrNiaspanFCT®) is an extended-released form of niacin also known as vitamin B3. Niacin is effective in reducing cholesterol levels in the blood. This drug has been known for a long-time to treat dyslipidemia and it is used to improve favourably all the lipoprotein risk factors for artherosclerotic disease particularly in HIV-infected patients. Recent scientific research shows that regular consumption of niacin-rich foods may also provide protection against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline. The purpose of this study is to find out:   1. If ER niacin combined with anti-HIV drugs compared with anti-HIV drugs alone could reduce T cell immune activation and enhance CD4 recovery;   2. If ER niacin can improve your quality of life and your neurocognitive functions    ,NCT02018965
HIV,Comprehensive Triaged HIV Prevention in Tanzania, This is a 3-year Phase II trial of a HIV prevention strategy designed to significantly reduce population-level HIV incidence. The study design is a two-arm community randomized controlled trial of Comprehensive Triaged HIV Prevention (CTHP) which includes: (a) Access to an HIV center which will provide free HIV testing and counseling (b) Educational activities related to HIV risk behavior (c) Special counseling sessions for HIV-infected clients (d) A onetime provision of a small amount of food or health products for sex partners of persons testing positive for HIV or reporting HIV risk behaviors when they come to receive HIV testing (e) A post test support club for persons infected with HIV (f) An income generation training program for people testing positive for HIV (g) Transportation assistance in visiting the HIV Care and Treatment Clinic in the area for those who test positive for HIV and (h) Counseling and transportation support for those on medical treatment for HIV to assist them in attending scheduled appointments and receiving and taking their medications as recommended by the clinic staff. The study will take place within two communities located in Kisarawe district Tanzania. The intervention will occur over an 18-month period with outcomes assessed at baseline and post-intervention. The study hypothesis is that individuals in the intervention community will have a lower incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) than those in the control community.    ,NCT02018978
HIV,Scale-up of an Internet-Delivered Study for HIV+ Men, Although HIV testing and highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) have improved survival with HIV the relatively low level of ART adherence presents a significant public health challenge in terms of the potential to transmit HIV. Preventing transmission in virally unsuppressed HIV+ MSM who have unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with serodiscordant partners can have a great public health impact. As new HIV infections in MSM have been attributed in part to increased access to sex partners online it is critical to deliver behavioral interventions to HIV+ MSM online to reach many high-risk men at a relatively low cost. The investigators' theoretically-grounded HIV prevention videos about UAI HIV disclosure and testing in MSM were rigorously evaluated among MSM recruited online. Findings indicated significant reductions in UAI and significant increases in HIV status disclosure at 3-month follow-up compared to baseline. In a subsequent online randomized controlled trial (RCT) for MSM investigators found significant reductions in UAI among MSM in the video arm at 60-day follow-up compared to baseline; HIV+ MSM in the video arm reduced UAI including serodiscordant UAI (SDUAI) at 60-day follow-up compared to baseline. Based on these findings investigators worked with POZ.com (POZ) the largest website for HIV+ individuals to test whether they could recruit ethnically diverse HIV+ MSM and were very successful. The investigators have identified a potentially highly effective and feasible risk reduction intervention approach for HIV+ MSM. With the commitment of POZ and a strong team of experts the investigators propose to refine our intervention by editing our 3 HIV prevention videos into short doses for 10 online sessions (including boosters); targeting HIV+ MSM who are virally unsuppressed; monitoring self-reported clinical indicators (i.e. viral load); targeting online recruitment by race/ethnicity to enroll equal numbers of HIV+ White Black and Hispanic MSM for balanced representation; improving retention with incentives and a proven online platform; including educational information about ART adherence; and cost and cost-effectiveness analyses for potentially averted HIV infections to determine health-related cost savings. Online the investigators will recruit and follow a national sample of 1500 high-risk virally unsuppressed HIV+ MSM for 12 months.    ,NCT02023580
HIV,Systems Analysis and Improvement to Optimize pMTCT, Despite significant increases in global health investment and the availability of low-cost efficacious interventions designed to reduce mother to child HIV transmission in low and middle income countries with high HIV burden the translation of these scientific advances into effective delivery strategies has been slow uneven and incomplete. As a result pediatric HIV infection remains largely uncontrolled. Enhancing the implementation of pMTCT interventions through contextually appropriate systems analysis and improvement approaches can potentially reduce drop-offs along the pMTCT cascade leading to dramatic improvements in infant and maternal outcomes. The goal of this proposal is to develop a model for systematic assessment and improvement of pMTCT services in sub-Saharan Africa. In specific aim 1 we will identify health system factors and service delivery approaches associated with high and low performing pMTCT services in Côte d'Ivoire Kenya and Mozambique. In specific aim 2 we will adapt evaluate the feasibility and impact of a systems analysis tool and associated performance enhancement approach for pMTCT services in Côte d'Ivoire Kenya and Mozambique. This systems analysis tool and associated performance enhancement approach is currently being developed and piloted for pMTCT services in Mozambique. The results of this implementation research are expected to generate knowledge of global health significance and by disseminating the study results and intervention tools through the broad PEPFAR network can rapidly impact pMTCT service delivery enhancements across the highest need countries.    ,NCT02023658

HIV,Immunogenicity of Inactivated Swine H1N1 Vaccine In HIV Infected Children - The Miami Cohort Study," Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for complications of influenza infection including secondary pneumonia and are recommended for annual influenza vaccination. Thus the appearance of a novel subtype of influenza A virus designated as 2009 swine H1N1 virus has added an extra layer of complexity in the immunization regimen in this population. In general susceptibility to swine H1N1 infection among young population is higher as young adults and children completely lack protective titers. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) 70 percent of people hospitalized with H1N1 have been ""high risk"" cases including persons 65 years of age or older or people with compromised immune systems as observed during HIV infection. This has prompted CDC to include HIV infected children to be one of the five groups to be vaccinated with the new H1N1 vaccine (National Center for Immunization). Currently no information exists about the nature of the immune response to the vaccine against H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) in HIV infected children. It is unknown whether HIV impairs the immunogenicity of the vaccine predisposing this population to infection with S-OIV. Thus a pilot proposal is being undertaken to study the mechanism of H1N1 vaccine protection in HIV infected children by investigating the correlation of infection status with seroresponse duration of response and development of influenza-like illness following vaccine. Additionally we will establish whether we can identify immune signatures by characteristic gene expression patterns correlating with the vaccine immunogenicity that can be predictive of efficacy for ""good"" and ""suboptimal"" vaccination regimen. Data generated will be used to initiate a comprehensive study on the immunogenicity of the influenza vaccines in HIV-infected children and youth which is critically important to address the health care needs of this vulnerable population.

HIV,Assessing the Impact of an Intervention to Prevent Intimate Partner Violence and HIV in Uganda, Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a precursor to and consequence of HIV infection. Few interventions combining HIV and IPV prevention have been evaluated and none has significantly decreased both outcomes. A cluster-randomized trial was conducted in Rakai Uganda. Four intervention arm clusters (N=5339) received an IPV prevention intervention (the Safe Homes and Respect for Everyone (SHARE) Project) enhanced HIV testing and treatment and routine HIV services provided by Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP). Seven control arm clusters (N=6112) received standard of care HIV services alone. Baseline and two follow-up visits were conducted via the Rakai Community Cohort Study between 2005 and 2009. Primary outcomes were past year emotional physical and sexual IPV and HIV incidence. Secondary outcomes included past year intimate partner rape/forced sex number of total and extra-marital sex partners alcohol use surrounding sex condom use discussion about condom use partner's disclosure of HIV status and respondent's disclosure of HIV status. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence risk ratios (PRR) to detect the impact of the intervention on IPV and secondary outcomes. Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) of HIV acquisition per 100 person years (py). Our study had three research aims and related hypotheses. Aim 1 was to assess the impact of SHARE + RHSP community services on report of victimization from and perpetration of physical and/or sexual IPV in the past 12 months compared to the impact of RHSP community services alone. Hypothesis 1(a): SHARE intervention will reduce women's reports of IPV victimization in intervention vs. control arms. Hypothesis 1(b): SHARE intervention will reduce men's reports of IPV perpetration in intervention vs. control arms. Aim 2 was to assess the impact of SHARE + RHSP services on report of sexual risk behaviors among men and women compared to the impact of RHSP community services alone. Hypothesis 2(a): SHARE intervention will reduce selected sexual risk behaviors in the intervention vs. control arms. Aim 3 was to assess the impact of SHARE + RHSP services on HIV incidence compared to the impact of RHSP community services alone. Hypothesis 3(a): Incidence of HIV will be lower in the intervention vs. control arms.    ,NCT02050763
HIV,Increasing Motivation for Antiretroviral Therapy Initiation: A Pilot Intervention, In this 3-year study the investigators will develop and pilot test an intervention called Personal Approaches to Treatment Choices for HIV (PATCH). PATCH is a brief intervention designed to support participants' decision-making processes and enhance intrinsic motivation to initiate ART using motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. The intervention will be targeted at HIV-positive African-American adults in inner-city Baltimore Maryland who are suboptimally engaged in care and who endorse conspiracy beliefs about HIV or low readiness to begin ART. The specific aims are: (1) Develop and refine a manual for a brief MI intervention to support ART decision-making and reduce the likelihood of ART refusal: (2) Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the PATCH intervention in a small sample of individuals who are African-American recommended for ART but who are not current taking it and who experience multiple barriers to ART adherence; and (3) Conduct a small randomized controlled pilot to test the potential efficacy of the PATCH intervention in producing positive attitudinal changes including a reduction in conspiracy beliefs and perceived barriers to ART and stated readiness to begin ART.    ,NCT02055417
HIV,HIV+ Alveolar Macrophage Oxidant-mediated Apoptosis of Pulmonary Endothelium, In HIV+ cigarette smokers with no prior history of pulmonary infections emphysema is often developed at an earlier age and is a significant cause of morbidity despite treatment with antiretroviral drugs. Preliminary data gathered from HIV+ individuals that smoke cigarettes strongly support the hypothesis that the combination of HIV infection and smoking creates increased stress in the lower respiratory tract. To examine the underlying factors that contribute to the accelerated development of emphysema in this cohort samples from the lower respiratory tract will be provided by HIV+ and HIV- subjects. The samples collected will serve as biomarkers for assessing the onset of emphysema.    ,NCT02056158
HIV,Immunosuppressive Effects of Smoking and HIV-1 on the Development of Lung Disease, This study plans to learn more about pulmonary complications of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Even though antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically decreased the number of opportunistic infections and deaths in HIV infected patients pulmonary complications (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) development and pneumonias resulting in decreased lung function) of HIV/AIDS continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of COPD and decreased lung function in HIV infected individuals is not well understand and needs to be studied. The investigators hypothesize that the immunoregulatory consequences and immunosuppressive lung milieu secondary to HIV and cigarette smoke combine to increase the risk of lung infection and injury in HIV infected smokers hastening the development of COPD. The mechanisms will be directly tested using blood and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) cells from smokers and nonsmokers with and without HIV infection.    ,NCT02058719
HIV,Pre-exposure Option for Reducing HIV in the UK.(PROUD), This study is looking at a new way to reduce the risk of catching HIV - Truvada-PrEP. To find out whether a daily tablet Truvada can safely reduce the risk of gay men catching HIV we need to do a large trial in which half the men do not receive Truvada for one year. We do not know if gay men at risk of HIV are interested in taking Truvada and if they are whether they would be willing to wait a year before they can take it. The reason it may not be safe is that taking Truvada-PrEP may lead to an increase in risk behaviour. This could mean there was more chance of catching HIV and other infections. As well as finding out if a large trial would be possible this study will looks at other factors including:   -  Whether people using PrEP change the number of partners they have sex with   -  Whether people using PrEP change how often they use condoms   -  Whether PrEP leads to higher rates of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This information on changes in sexual activity over time is one of the most important aspects of the study because we have never collected this before in the UK. This means we don't know what happens to people's sexual activity without PrEP! In October 2014 an interim analysis of the PROUD study data showed that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was highly protective against HIV for gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at high risk of infection. The PROUD Trial Steering Committee announced that participants on the deferred arm of the study who had not yet started PrEP should be offered the opportunity to begin PrEP ahead of schedule. As a result we changed the study design and offered all enrolled participants the opportunity to access PrEP. All study participants will be followed up until study closure in October 2016    ,NCT02065986
HIV,BK Virus in Salivary Gland Disease: Treating the Potential Etiologic Agent, The purpose of this study is to analyze BK viral infection in salivary gland diseases; specifically to determine a definitive relationship between BK Virus and HIV associated salivary gland disease (HIVSGD). Participants are adults HIV+SGD+ who will be randomized 1:1 to receive BK Virus antiviral (ciprofloxacin) or placebo for 28 days. Salivary function/protein secretion will be correlated with BK polyomavirus titers. We expect that patients with HIV+SGD+ will have elevated oral BK polyomavirus viral loads and will benefit from Ciprofloxacin.    ,NCT02068846
HIV,Prevention of Transmission of Sexually Transmitted Diseases in the Youth Through Effective Intervention, The data of Taiwan CDC showed the total HIV victims amounted up to 22020 from 1984 to 2011. Under risk factor analysis it indicated the increasing victims among MSM (men having sex with men including homosexuals & bisexuals) cohorts from 64% of them in 2009 to 72% in 2011. For age stratification of patients the youth (from 15 to 24 years old) comprised of 18.5% (4078). Among them 40% are students. MSM are still the main population (over 80%) from 2009 to 2011. Therefore it is crucial to target the young MSM.    ,NCT02069652

HIV,Immunogenicity of Three HIV GTU® MultiHIV DNA Immunisations Administered Via Intramuscular Intradermal and Transcutaneous Routes, Our research is part of the global effort to develop a vaccine against HIV. We aim to develop a non-invasive needle-free 'transcutaneous' vaccine. It will be a water-based solution which is placed on the surface of the skin of the upper arm after the hairs have been stripped away. The active component of the vaccine - DNA which contains genes derived from the virus - will enter through the hair follicles from which the hair has been stripped. The DNA will get into cells which will use the HIV genes to make copies of virus proteins. These proteins will stimulate the body's immune system and we hope make it able to protect against HIV infection. The research is to assess the safety of this approach and how good it is at stimulating the immune system. We will combine the 'transcutaneous' vaccine with an 'intramuscular' version which is injected into the muscle of the thigh and compare this combination with: intramuscular plus 'intradermal' (injection into the skin); and intramuscular with added 'electroporation' - use of a pulse of electricity to increase uptake of DNA vaccines. We will invite healthy men and women to take part in this research. Volunteers will first be assessed to ensure they are eligible to participate. A total of 30 will be enrolled and each will receive three vaccinations over the course of 12 weeks. We will assess the effects of the vaccinations by recording any symptoms experienced by the volunteers and by analysing samples of their blood. The research will take place at the St Mary's Hospital campus of Imperial College London UK. The DNA component of the vaccine is an experimental substance so we will monitor very closely the wellbeing of the men and women who participate in the research.    ,NCT02075983
HIV,Representations and Acceptability of HIV Therapeutic Vaccine in a Cohort of HIV-1 Infected Outpatients Followed at Hospital, The main objective of the study is to assess the acceptability of a future therapeutic vaccine against HIV in patients living with HIV-1. Secondary objectives concern the validation of a specific questionnaire for self-perception and acceptability of therapeutic vaccination against HIV-1 (RAVVIH) the development of a composite score for acceptability based on this questionnaire and the analysis of critical factors related to: representations of vaccination in general representations of therapeutic vaccination specific to HIV perception of disease severity health-related quality of life doctor-patient relationship.    ,NCT02077101
HIV,Inducing Immune Quiescence to Prevent HIV Infection in Women, In this project the investigators want to analyse the capacity of Acetylsalicylic acid and hydoxychlroquin (HCQ) to induce an Immune Quiescence (IQ) phenotype which has been previously associated with natural protection to HIV infection. This phenotype is characterized by lower expression of genes involved in cellular activation lower resting levels of inflammatory cytokine production lower level of systemic activated T cells increased levels of systemic T regulatory increased production of anti-viral anti-protease serpins at the female genital tract and reduced numbers of HIV target cells (mainly CD4+ CCR5+ T cells) in the FGT ( female genital tract). The objective of this study is to determine if daily oral administration of Acetylsalicylic acid or hydroxychlroroquin can reduce systemic and mucosal immune activation in HIV negative women.    ,NCT02079077
HIV,A Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Etonogestrel (ENG) Implant and Antiretroviral Therapy, Antiretroviral therapy (medicines used to treat HIV) can interact with hormonal contraceptives which might decrease their effectiveness. The single-rod etonogestrel contraceptive implant is being more commonly used in low- and middle-income countries because if the ease of insertion and removal. Efavirenz and nevirapine are first-line HIV medicines in Sub-Saharan Africa and this study will help determine an effective way to use these medicines with the etonogestrel implant. The investigators hypothesize that women receiving nevirapine- or efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy will have lower etonogestrel levels in their blood after six months of insertion as compared to women not taking antiretroviral therapy.    ,NCT02082652
HIV,Testing and Linkage to HIV Care in China, This study will evaluate the effects of a comprehensive approach (One4All) to increase the percentage of patients that receive their HIV testing results and counseling. Primary Hypothesis: The One4All approach will increase the proportion of individuals who have completed all tests to confirm HIV diagnosis and received counseling within 30 days of screening HIV+ given they have screened HIV+ on the initial test from 40% to 60%.    ,NCT02084316
HIV,Implementing a Comprehensive Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV Program for South African Couples, This study will test the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention to increase Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) protocol uptake among South African HIV positive pregnant women. This study will also determine whether the participation of male partners will have additional positive impact on PMTCT uptake. The intervention will utilize a combination of both gender-concordant groups and individual or couples counseling strategies before and after birth. During antenatal care the intervention will use a gender-concordant group format to address PMTCT information HIV disclosure coping with stigma intimate partner violence and adherence to the overall PMTCT protocol. Just prior to birth and following birth the intervention will shift to individual or couples-based counseling targeting medication adherence safer infant feeding and family planning. It is hypothesized that women attending the intervention will be more likely to properly take HIV medication before birth and provide it to their infants. Additionally it is hypothesized that male partner involvement will further increase the likelihood that mothers will take their HIV medication as prescribed and provide it to their infants.    ,NCT02085356
HIV,Timely Initiation of HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Among Those Who Delay/Decline," This study addresses racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS treatment. Many persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. (10-19% of PLHA) predominantly African-Americans and Latinos delay taking Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) until late in the course of their HIV disease or never initiate HAART when it is medically indicated. However there are no behavioral interventions to increase HAART initiation among PLHA who delay or decline HAART (""PLHA-DD""). The overarching aim of the proposed study is to develop a flexible targeted and sustainable behavioral intervention to increase HAART initiation among PLHA-DD which if efficacious will lead to reductions in morbidity early mortality and health care costs as well as increased viral load suppression (reducing transmission to others). Further the study complements and primes participants for existing adherence interventions from which PLHA-DD can benefit when they initiate HAART.    ",NCT02086630
HIV,Tenofovir Abacavir Platelet Activation Study, Some but not all observational studies have found that current exposure to abacavir is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction stroke and cardiovascular death. This study aim to investigate possible adverse effect of abacavir on platelet reactivity coagulation and endothelial activation in HIV-1 infected patients. The study is an open-labeled cross-over trial where patients receiving antiretroviral therapy containing abacavir switch treatment to a regimen containing tenofovir and vice versa for a period of 90 days.    ,NCT02093585
HIV,Tailored Nutrition and Food Security Interventions in Comprehensive HIV Care, The study hypothesizes that one form of food supplement to HIV-infected individuals in Haiti (ready-to-use-supplementary food) will result in improved HIV nutrition and quality of life outcomes when compared to a second type of food supplement (corn-soy-blend) over the course of 12 months of food supplementation.    ,NCT02095613
HIV,Cardiovascular Risk in HIV Patients Switching From a Boosted Protease Inhibitor (PI) to Dolutegravir (DTG), The purpose of the study is to investigate the benefits of switching away from a kind of drug called a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) to a new drug called dolutegravir on patients' cardiovascular health (the health of their hearts). Patients are currently taking two other anti-HIV drugs called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with their boosted PIs; these NRTIs will not be changed throughout the study. In order to compare the boosted PI and dolutegravir more accurately half of study participants will be switched to dolutegravir immediately and the other half will be switched after 48 weeks of continuing on the boosted PI. Boosted PIs are associated with increased heart and circulation risk so it is hoped that switching from a boosted PI to dolutegravir will improve the health of the patients' hearts. Dolutegravir is a drug for HIV treatment which has been approved for use in HIV patients in the US and Europe. Clinical trials using dolutegravir have found that it is effective at suppressing the HIV virus and it is at least as effective as the other drugs. This study will also investigate the safety (in terms of other side effects and the routine blood tests which the investigators ordinarily use to monitor patients' treatment) and monitor effectiveness patients' viral load and CD4 counts when patients switch treatment from a boosted PI to dolutegravir. Viral load is the amount of the HIV virus they have in their blood and CD4 count is a measure of a type of cell that is in their immune system. We also aim to improve patients' cardiovascular health in general by providing them with information on how to live a healthy lifestyle (eg improving their diet stopping smoking etc).    ,NCT02098837
HIV,Strength Training and Endurance Exercise for LIFE, Research is needed to determine safe and effective exercise rehabilitation programs to prevent and improve physical disability in older adults living with HIV. This problem is of great importance to the VA. The majority of the 25 thousand HIV-infected veterans are over 50 years of age (64%). The combined effect of aging and inflammation increase the risk for physical disability in older HIV-infected veterans. This translational exercise training trial will examine the cardiac and skeletal muscle effects of combined aerobic exercise and resistance training to attenuate the functional declines of aging with HIV by reducing the deleterious consequences of chronic inflammation. Findings will guide future rehabilitation research on cardiac remodeling and inflammation of skeletal muscle. The proposed research will advance the goal to develop effective rehabilitation strategies that improve the health of older HIV-infected veterans.    ,NCT02101060
HIV,ATAGLU: Study of Glucose Metabolism in HIV Positive Patients That Switch From Another Protease Inhibitor to Atazanavir, The association between HIV infection  insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus is the topic of many studies that have attempted to analyze the problem from different points of view. In fact the risk of insulin resistance in HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy seems to depend not only on the same factors that determine its incidence in the general population  but also on the effects of antiretroviral therapy on glucose metabolism. To confirm this observation studies that have evaluated the incidence of diabetes in patients with HIV infection on antiretroviral therapy have shown that the incidence of diabetes in infected individuals is significantly higher than that observed in the uninfected population. Moreover others preliminar stadies observed that protease inhibitors may induce hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. Anyway at this moment no large data are available that indicate the utility to modify the antiretroviral therapy in HIV positive patients with a damage of glucose metabolism. ATAGLU is a cohort composed by HIV positive patients in effective and stable combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) with undetectable viral load. All patients studied had carried out a therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) + optimal backbone therapy (OBT) and then in part switch to Atazanavir (ATV) + OBT or Atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) + OBT  in part continue with LPV/r + OBT . The objective was to characterize the changes of carbohydrate profile of a cohort of patients who made a switch from a regimen with LPV/r to boosted or unboosted ATV.    ,NCT02102048
HIV,A Risky Sex Prevention Intervention for Middle School Age Minority Girls, African American adolescent females are more likely to have sex at an early age to have older sex partners that have had multiple sexual experiences and are less likely to use a condom than their white counterparts. Lack of sexual assertiveness is a factor in the risky sex behaviors of young African American women. African American girls at the greatest risk for contracting HIV are the ones that report that their partners could convince them to have sex and report trouble communicating their wishes related to sex. Thus far no intervention has addressed the disparate rate of HIV infection in young African American girls. This study is unique in promoting increases in racial pride as a component of empowerment to help African American girls self-protect against HIV. The study has the potential to empower young African American girls to delay sex initiation or reduce risky sex behaviors and thus reduce their risk of contracting HIV.    ,NCT02103218
HIV,Clinical Trial on the Effects of Progestin-based Contraception in the Genital Tract of HIV-infected and Uninfected Women, The purpose of this study is to determine the acceptability of randomization to contraceptive options and estimate the effect of progestin contraception on HIV genital shedding and inflammatory/immune perturbations in women who may or may not be on antiretroviral therapy as well as in HIV-uninfected women controls. It is hypothesized that progestin-containing contraception will lead to inflammatory changes that may affect the local immune activity influencing HIV acquisition or transmissibility risk.    ,NCT02103660

HIV,The Navigator Project, Each year there are over 600 unduplicated HIV-infected persons incarcerated in the San Francisco jail. Two thirds of those released with HIV-focused discharge planning are reincarcerated within one year. More than half of HIV-infected jail inmates are diagnosed with mental health conditions severe enough to require medication and a similar proportion report substance use disorders at the time of detention. While some community-based services exist there remains a critical need to improve linkages to care and adherence to care plans for HIV-infected adults as they move between community and jail. The Navigator Project is a five-year randomized study that will test the effectiveness of an intensive enhanced case management intervention to reduce sex and drug-related HIV transmission risk; increase HIV medication adherence; reduce drug dependence; and reduce reincarceration.    ,NCT02106702

HIV,Study of Voicing My CHOiCES as a Tool for Advanced Care Planning in Young Adults With Cancer, Background: - There are very few documents to help young adults living with advanced cancer discuss their concerns and end-of-life preferences. A new document Voicing My CHOiCES allows young adults to explain what kind of care they would want if they became unable to communicate or make medical decisions on their own. Researchers want to study if this document is helpful. Objective: - To study if Voicing My CHOiCES can reduce anxiety improve sense of support and improve communication about advanced care planning. Eligibility: - Adults 18 to 39 years old being treated for cancer. Design:   -  Participants will answer questions about their age gender employment religion health and marital status. They will also complete several brief questionnaires:   1. General Anxiety Short Form   2. Peace Equanimity and Acceptance in the Cancer Experience   3. Functional Assessment of Social Support   4. Quality of Communication   5. Prior Communication about Advanced Care Planning   -  Then a health care professional will introduce Voicing My CHOiCES . Participants will review the document and comment on parts they find relevant. They will also say if any important items are missing. Participants will complete 3 pages of the document with the assistance of a health care provider. They will be asked for positive and negative observations.   -  The second stage of the study will take place about 1 month later. Participants will repeat the brief questionnaires listed above. They will be asked if they shared any of the preferences they described when completing the 3 pages of Voicing My CHOiCES during visit 1 with a family member friend or health care provider. Research staff will ask the participant for permission to contact the people they spoke with in order to learn whether their conversations about the document were helpful. They will ask for feedback on how to make Voicing My CHOiCES more helpful.    ,NCT02108028

HIV,Intervention to Assist MSM Disclose HIV Status to Casual Sex Partners, Men who have sex with men (MSM) remain disproportionately represented in the national HIV/AIDS statistics. Little progress has been made in understanding the nuances of MSM sexual behavior or communication that may be perpetuating the spread of HIV. Non-disclosure of an HIV-positive status may be a key factor responsible for male-male HIV transmission. There are no known intervention programs whose primary focus is to help MSM develop requisite skills to disclose their status to casual sexual partners. The development of such interventions is essential because of the numerous repercussions for not disclosing when one is HIV-positive such as legal prosecution and the transmission of HIV. In a previous intervention development study (R21MH067494) the research team created and tested a 4 session intervention found to be promising for increasing disclosure to casual sexual partners. The purpose of the proposed research is to further refine and enhance our HIV disclosure intervention (DI) designed to increase disclosure to casual sexual partners and reduce sexual risk taking behaviors among HIV-positive MSM; assess the relative effectiveness of a disclosure intervention to an attention control case management group (ACCM) for HIV-positive MSM; examine the effects of the intervention over time; explore differential treatment responses to the disclosure intervention and ACCM on the basis of ethnicity age and education level as well as examine the mediating effect of baseline frequency of sexual activity severity of substance abuse at baseline and stigmatized fear on the relationship between intervention type and the outcome. Finally the investigators will test how treatment engagement retention and expectations predict subsequent disclosure and risky sexual outcomes.    ,NCT02116049
HIV,The Health Check-Up for Expectant Moms, The objective of this study is to develop and determine feasibility of a computer-delivered intervention (Health Check-up for Expectant Moms) approach to target women at risk for HIV/STIs and alcohol/drug use during pregnancy through two phases of testing: The development aims of this study are to:   1. Develop intervention content.   2. Perform a small open trial (n = 10) of the computer based intervention (Health Check-up for Expectant Moms) to assess feasibility of recruitment of target population and acceptability of the intervention and study procedures via participant report of ease of use helpfulness and overall satisfaction. The pilot study aims of this study are to:   1. Conduct a randomized controlled pilot study in a sample of 50 high risk (at risk for HIV/STIs and alcohol/drug use) pregnant women.   2. Determine:   1. feasibility of the computer based intervention   2. acceptability via participant report of ease of use helpfulness and overall satisfaction   3. evidence for the hypothesized effects on outcomes: the proposed intervention in comparison to a time-and-attention-matched control group will produce reductions in HIV/STIs risk behavior during the follow-up assessment at 4 months.   3. Determine if the intervention condition relative to control will produce reductions in alcohol/drug use (frequency quantity and heavy drinking/use frequency).   4. Determine effects on process variables: if participants assigned to the intervention condition relative to control will demonstrate greater increases in knowledge readiness to change and risk perceptions.    ,NCT02120716
HIV,Implementation of a Sexual Health Intervention for Young Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM) in Two Vietnamese Cities, This study seeks to implement a sexual health promotion intervention for male sex workers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam. The study hypothesis is that this intervention will increase testing treatment and vaccination for sexually transmitted infections including intentions of participants to engage in these services beyond the conclusion of the intervention. At the community level the study hypothesis is that male sex workers will be more aware of sexual health care and more likely to access these services in the future.    ,NCT02122094

It examines virologic treatment failure as well as chronic communicable and non-communicable comorbidities among patients on ART. The study has two phases. Phase 1 consists of a cross-sectional survey to determine prevalence of treatment failure as well as the prevalence of the following comorbidities: diabetes mellitus arterial hypertension dyslipidemia depression alcohol use disorder hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Phase 2 is a cohort study where patients with treatment failure or a comorbidity or both are followed-up for 12 months.    ,NCT02126696
HIV,Assessing Strategies for Increasing Male Involvement in Malawi's Antenatal Program, In sub-Saharan Africa engaging men in HIV prevention care and treatment has proven challenging. Along all steps of the HIV care-seeking cascade men exhibit worse care-seeking behaviors than women. They are less likely to be tested for HIV initiate combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and be retained in cART care. Additionally men rarely engage in the care of their female sex partners even though couple care-seeking is associated with marked improvements in condom use within HIV-discordant couples. Option B+ Malawi's program for providing immediate lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to all HIV-infected pregnant women at the time of diagnosis is an important entry-point for involving male partners in care. This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (N=200 women) comparing two strategies of male partner involvement within the Option B+ program. In both arms (patient referral and contract referral) women will be encouraged to invite their male partners to accompany them to the clinic for couple HIV counseling and testing. In the contract referral arm if the couple does not present within one week the male partner will receive a home visit encouraging them to present to the clinic. We will compare the two arms for 1) uptake of couple HIV counseling and testing (cHCT) 2) uptake of cART for women and 3) linkage to care for HIV-infected men. Results are expected to inform a larger trial and ultimately improve care-seeking in Malawi's HIV program. Objective 1: Determine acceptability of male partner recruitment for cHTC within an Option B+ context. We will assess acceptability of eligible females to participate in this pilot RCT and reasons for non-participation. Objective 2: Assess whether study arm (patient referral versus contract referral) is associated with cHTC uptake. We will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of male partner recruitment. This study will contain two arms: patient referral and contract referral for uptake of cHTC (primary outcome).    ,NCT02139176

HIV,German Centre for Infection Research HIV Translational Platform," Despite major advances in therapy and management HIV/AIDS continues to be a major cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality on a global scale. The discovery of effective antiretroviral treatment has turned HIV infection into a manageable chronic disease in most patients with access to care. However the different economic and epidemiologic situation in developing and developed countries requires different research priorities so that three main challanges are universal and in focus of research of the DZIF HIV Translational Platform:   -  Prevention of HIV infection   -  Long-term life with HIV   -  HIV cure The ""Translation Reserach HIV"" will bring together clinical researchers in HIV infection in order to develop new treatment options to the above mentioned main challanges. It will take advantage of existing expertise (e.g. basic science novel targets for treatment and HIV eradiation) of the partner sites. This platform is necessary because Germany's HIV research has suffered in the past from a lack of integration between its excellent basic science and clinical research. In addition there was too little integration into networks that address the main international challenges. There is an urgent need to link these research strands through dedicated structures emphasising the translation of preclinical results into new therapies.    ",NCT02149004
HIV,PRe-Exposure Prophylaxis Acceptability & Readiness Assessments for Toronto gaY Bisexual and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men-5, Canada continues to see an unrelenting stream of new HIV diagnoses with a disproportionate burden among gay bisexual and other MSM in major centers such as Toronto. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with oral daily tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC Truvada®) is a novel biomedical approach to HIV prevention shown in the iPrEx trial to be safe and efficacious in reducing HIV acquisition by 44% among MSM when provided in a comprehensive package of HIV prevention interventions including counseling testing/treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and condoms. There is now widespread mobilization to assess the feasibility of PrEP roll-out worldwide with urgent calls for 'demonstration projects' addressing real-world PrEP implementation issues. PREPARATORY-5 is Canada's first PrEP demonstration project and will examine real-world PrEP implementation issues including acceptability effectiveness impact on sexually transmitted infections and strategies for supporting adherence outside the clinical trial setting. The investigators have also established a comprehensive community-based research program investigating the role of community-based organizations in PrEP implementation and delivery.    ,NCT02149888
HIV,Quantitative Measurement and Correlates of the Latent HIV Reservoir in Virally Suppressed Ugandans, Background: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV can hide in the blood for many years even in people who have their HIV infection under control. HIV that is hiding in the blood is called the latent HIV reservoir. Researchers want to find out more about it in this study. This knowledge may help them develop new ways to prevent or control HIV. This study will draw its participants from the Rakai Health Sciences Program in rural southwestern Uganda. Objective: - To measure and learn about the latent HIV reservoir in Ugandans with HIV. Eligibility: - Men and women at least 18 years of age with HIV. Design:   -  Participants will have a medical history and physical exam. Their medical records will be reviewed. Researchers will ask participants about their health and recent illnesses. Participants able to get pregnant will have their urine tested for pregnancy.   -  Participants will have their finger pricked to see if they have enough red blood cells to be eligible for the study.   -  If eligible participants will have blood drawn through a needle in the arm. Their blood will also be tested for other diseases.   -  After the blood draw participants will be asked to stay seated or lying down if they are not feeling well for up to 30 minutes.    ,NCT02154035

HIV,Study to Determine Impact of Feeding Buddies on Adherence to WHO PMTCT Guidelines in South Africa, The 2010 revised WHO recommendations to provide antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis or treatment to mothers or infants during the breastfeeding period indicate a paradigm shift in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT); care; and treatment programming. Yet despite South Africa's adoption of this guidance myriad challenges currently exist. Confusion in the public health care system related to mixed messaging around safe infant feeding and the provision of?and now withdrawal of?free formula milk have made adherence to exclusive breastfeeding a challenge in South Africa. Cultural social and psychological factors influence the ability of women to follow PMTCT guidelines which include exclusive breastfeeding for six months adherence to ARV prophylaxis or treatment and early infant diagnosis. Facility-based interventions alone are often inadequate to effect sustained behavioral changes in the face of multiple contextual factors. Community- and home-based support are needed yet cost and systems constraints make these infeasible in many PMTCT programs. Some preliminary pilot data suggests that a feeding buddy strategy could fill this gap and provide a home-based support system for the mother. The feeding buddy who is selected by an HIV-positive pregnant woman to support her in overcoming sociocultural challenges to adhering to various aspects of PMTCT programs is not an employed health care worker but rather an individual known to the mother making the intervention extremely cost-effective and requiring minimal resources to implement. In the Uthungulu District of KZN the Programme for Appropriate Technologies in Health (PATH) is implementing a programme (Window of Opportunity-WinOp) of improving health of mothers and infants and the feeding buddy strategy is one of the strategies included in this overall package of care. While this strategy has been encouraged by the South African Department of Health it has not previously been implemented nor obviously evaluated. In order to scale-up such a programme and justify the human resource costs it is vital that such a programme be evaluated. The goal of this proposed research study is therefore to evaluate the effect of the feeding buddy strategy to support mothers to adhere to PMTCT recommendations. The investigators hypothesize that mothers who choose a feeding buddy will have increased rates of exclusive breastfeeding and adherence to ARV prophylaxis or treatment as well as improved rates of early infant diagnosis and stigma reduction. This evaluation will provide valuable information to the Department of Health in terms of choosing best practice models for promoting HIV-free infant survival and optimum health of infants in resource limited settings. The project plans to employ a cluster randomized intervention design and will include 300 mothers and their infants as well as the 300 buddies in the intervention group as well as 300 mothers in the control group. All participants will be part of the WinOp feeding buddy intervention programme.    ,NCT02162498
HIV,Zinc Supplementation Effect on Immune Recovery in HIV Patients, INTRODUCTION: An adequate zinc supplementation is essential for a good immunological function. However zinc deficiency is seen in more than 50% of adults infected with HIV. The safety and efficiency of zinc supplements in the progression of HIV is evaluated in the short-term. HYPOTHESIS Null hypothesis: Zinc supplementation does not improve the immunological recovery of HIV patients after three months of daily consumption. Alternate hypothesis: Zinc supplementation improves the immunological recovery of HIV patients after three months of daily consumption    ,NCT02162797
HIV,Effects of Probiotics on Microbial Translocation and Immune Activation Markers in HIV-positive Patients on Combined Antiretroviral Therapy, Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART)-treated patients have increased mortality and morbidity compared to age-matched seronegative individuals. This increased mortality and morbidity has been associated to immune activation that persists also in patients under cART even with undetectable levels of HIV-RNA in blood. Indeed HIV-infected patients irrespective of cART treatment show higher levels of activated T cells inflammatory monocytes and proinflammatory cytokines than seronegative individuals. Several putative causes of this residual inflammation have been proposed and include ongoing HIV replication at low levels the presence of coinfections such as cytomegalovirus and microbial translocation. None of these causes are mutually exclusive and understanding the degree to which of these three cause residual inflammation in cART-treated individuals will require novel therapeutic interventions aimed at alleviated each putative cause. In this longitudinal study we aim:   1. to reduce microbial translocation induced inflammation in cART-treated individuals with supplementation of cART with the probiotics.   2. to investigate the potential benefits of 24 weeks of probiotics supplementation on immune function and on immune activation status Indeed the early stage of HIV infection is associated with dysbiosis of the GI tract microbiome with reducted levels of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus species with increased levels of potentially pathogenic proteobacteria species.    ,NCT02164344

HIV,Increasing Social Support to Improve HIV Care Engagement and Adherence in St. Petersburg Russia, Prior research has documented serious health mental health and social-behavioral issues among people living with HIV (PLH) in St. Petersburg. The investigators have established that PLH are clustered in friendship groups with other HIV+ persons and that an intervention delivered to groups composed of HIV+ men who have sex with men (MSM) who were friends in real life reduced mental health distress more than individual counseling. Specific aims of the collaborative mixed-methods qualitative/ quantitative research are to: (1) identify facilitators and barriers of medical care attendance and ART adherence among PLH in St. Petersburg; (2) integrate these data into an intervention designed to increase HIV care attendance retention and adherence; (3) carry out a test-of-concept pilot study that recruits groups of PLH friends and delivers an intervention to intact PLH friendship groups to encourage mutual social support for attending medical appointments and adhering to HIV care; and (4) evaluate the effects of the intervention on both behavioral and biological measures including viral load. These specific aims will be achieved by research carried out in two phases: In Phase I we will conduct in-depth interviews with 60 PLH and key informants in St. Petersburg purposively selected to include HIV+ persons in and not in medical care adherent or not adherent to ART and including men and women representing diverse exposure risks. In-depth interviews will be analyzed to identify factors associated with attending or not attending care and adhering or not adhering to ART as well as identifying how HIV+ friends can support one another in HIV care entry retention and adherence. In Phase II the investigators will undertake a randomized intervention pilot study in which 20 groups of PLH friends are recruited by enrolling a PLH seed who is not reliably in care or is ART nonadherent and then recruiting all friends known by the seed to also be HIV+. A 7-session group intervention will be undertaken with all members of the friendship groups in the experimental condition to increase care and adherence-related social support problem-solving and mutual assistance for care. Baseline to 6-month followup data will determine whether the intervention produces greater improvement than found in the comparison group in care attendance and treatment adherence improved mental health lower substance use and lower HIV viral load.    ,NCT02167828

HIV,Connecting Resources for Urban Sexual Health, The overall goal of the CRUSH project is to enhance and extend a response to the local HIV/AIDS epidemic in Alameda County with a set of innovative evidence-based interventions across the continuum of HIV prevention and care targeting individuals and communities most vulnerable to HIV. The East Bay AIDS Center in partnership with the University of California San Francisco's Center for AIDS Prevention Studies the Gladstone Institutes and several key community-based organizations are engaging in a participatory partnership to enhance and implement HIV services which target the East Bay's highest risk population- young men who have sex with men (Y/MSM). Specifically the CRUSH Project is designed to evaluate a combination of program approaches to address the sexual health care needs of young gay men of color and their sexual partners by enhancing the current program activities of the Downtown Youth Clinic (DYC). We hypothesize that we can reduce the impact of HIV among Y/MSM by expanding the current DYC services structure in two ways. We intend to expand HIV testing and linkage to and retention in care for youth who test HIV positive providing them with intensive risk-reduction counseling and antiretroviral treatment and thereby ultimately reducing the risk of further HIV transmission. And we intend for the first time to offer a comprehensive combination package of preventive services to HIV-negative youth including routine accesses to HIV/STI screening and treatment and access to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The CRUSH Project will also have a substudy that will enroll HIV-negative participants who are eligible to receive PEP. The substudy will evaluate the tolerability and acceptability of a 28 day course of Stribild® given as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent sexual acquisition of HIV-1 in Y/MSM of color.    ,NCT02183909
HIV,PATH For Triples Study: Medication and Lifestyle Adherence for HIV+ Patients, The PATH for Triples (PFT) Study is an effectiveness trial comparing a nurse health navigator (NHN) model for HIV+ persons with severe mental illness and substance abuse (i.e. triply diagnosed) with Treatment as Usual (TAU). The team completed a Phase II trial of the nurse health navigator model for HIV+ persons with severe mental illness that showed the intervention was effective. The investigators are now testing the intervention in a real world setting with patients recruited from psychiatric and substance abuse inpatient units in Philadelphia using a longitudinal design. The intervention is set up as a cascade where non-adherent patients receive additional visits from the study nurses. It is hypothesized that patients assigned to the NHN will have better medication compliance reduced viral loads and improved CD4 counts compared to patients assigned to TAU. It is also hypothesized that the PFT intervention group will be more cost effective compared to TAU. This group of triply diagnosed patients are at very high risk of negative health outcomes and secondary transmission of HIV and therefore the study is of high public health significance.    ,NCT02185144
HIV,Planning for SUCCESS, Planning for SUCCESS (Sustained Unbroken Connections to Care Entry Services and Suppression) is a project to improve the connection to community care for HIV infected persons leaving Fulton County Jail or Atlanta City Detention Center in Atlanta. Hypothesis: Participants who receive the intervention will be more likely to link to medical care after jail release than similar participants who do not receive the intervention. Rationale and objective: This project aims to make sure HIV positive persons leaving jail maintain medical care. Case managers will use strength based case management and phone texting technology to improve release's connections to care in the community. This study will have extensive tracking of outcomes. The key outcome will be whether HIV infected participants receiving an intervention experience suppression of their viral load after release from jail . The investigators wish to demonstrate the ability to recruit participants into the SUCCESS intervention and repeatedly check community medical records to see how well their infection is being controlled after they linked to care. Investigators also want to conduct a survey at baseline 3 months and 12 months. Investigators will compare the viral load of participants receiving the intervention to participants passing through the jail who do not receive the outcome.    ,NCT02185742

HIV,Females of African American Legacy Empowering Self (FemAALES), The FemAALES Project is a community collaborative two-arm intervention designed to prevent HIV (human immunodeficiency) and STD (sexually transmitted disease) infection and transmission among African American women and men by reducing sexual risk factors and enhancing sexual negotiation skills. The team of investigators is a collaboration of researchers and community service providers who are committed to developing prevention interventions that employ holistic and culturally relevant approaches. This includes recognizing the impact of forces such as racism sexism and gender expectations on individual behavior and relationship dynamics in African American communities. Specifically the investigators hypothesis is that compared to the control condition the FemAALES intervention arm will reduce risky sexual behavior and STI (sexually transmitted infection) incidence and will increase condom self-efficacy and risk behavior communication with sexual partners.    ,NCT02189876

HIV,Disability and HIV: Vulnerability of People With Disabilities to HIV Infection in Sub-Saharan Africa, According to the recent World Report on Disability around 15% of the world population lives with a disability and 80% of people with disabilities (PWD) live in developing countries. More and more evidence show that PWD are more likely to be poor vulnerable to physical and sexual violence and to have less access to education. Therefore PWD are likely to have an increased risk for HIV infection potentially being a key population in regard to this epidemic. The vulnerability of PWD was recognized in 2007 by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However data on the extent how PWD are affected by HIV is still very limited. As a result PWD are usually overlooked by National AIDS Control Programmes and few projects specifically targeting them have been developed. Recognizing the need for appropriate and reliable data to help protect the rights of PWD and achieve a better inclusion of disability in National AIDS Control Programmes the Institute of Research for Development (IRD) the Institut de Formation et Recherche Demographique (IFORD) and Handicap International (HI) propose this study that aims to provide quantitative and qualitative data on the vulnerability of PWD to HIV infection in Cameroon and Burkina Faso in order to define if this vulnerable population is also a Key Population in relation to the HIV epidemic. This study adopts a multidisciplinary approach (quantitative and qualitative methods). Quantitative data are collected only in Cameroon. Only the quantitative study is described here.    ,NCT02192658

HIV,PrEP Demonstration Project (PRELUDE Study)," Significant increases in HIV diagnoses among gay and other homosexually active men in Australia and internationally have been observed since the late 1990s. The levels of high HIV risk sexual practices among gay men have also increased particularly unprotected anal intercourse (UAI). Nationally over three quarters of the new HIV infections diagnosed annually are among men who have sex with men (MSM). The proportion of heterosexual men and women among those diagnosed with HIV annually has also increased in recent years. Despite successes in some situations HIV transmission has not been adequately reduced by the prevention methods available to those at risk such as education condoms and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The effectiveness of daily oral antiretroviral medications (ARVs) as preexposure prophylaxis of HIV (PrEP) has now been established by clinical trials in both heterosexual adults and homosexual men. Whether PrEP confers high rates of protection in real life situations and is a feasible strategy to implement still requires further investigation. Through its ""HIV prevention strategy 2015: New era"" NSW Health committed to consider how to most appropriately and efficiently implement PrEP in line with evidence. This commitment translated in the support to this PrEP demonstration project. This demonstration project is designed to evaluate the off-label provision of daily combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC known as TRUVADA) as PrEP to a sample of sero-negative individuals at high risk for HIV infection in clinical settings in New South Wales. The project will inform policy development regarding primary HIV prevention with PrEP. This is an open-label single-arm treatment evaluation study. All consenting and eligible HIV negative participants will receive TRUVADA prescribed for daily administration orally. At each followup visit the following procedures will be conducted: clinical evaluations/ procedures laboratory evaluations/ procedures testing for HIV STIs hepatic and renal function assessment for adherence to the prescribed medication side effects eligibility for next TRUVADA prescription and willingness to continue on PrEP. As a study requirement participants will be offered a self-administered assessment of behaviour lifestyle and attitudes which will be conducted ideally within two and no more than seven days of the clinic visit in the participant's private space. Analyses will include: the feasibility of PrEP delivery adherence to the study medication safety and tolerability the effects of PrEP use on behavior and statistical analyses of the risk of HIV seroconversion.

HIV,Raltegravir-based Antiretroviral Versus Maintaining Any Other Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV Mono-infected Patients, People infected with HIV are living longer thanks to the use of antiretroviral therapy (cART). In aging HIV persons other factors are associated with early death. One of the major factors is liver disease which can be due to liver infections or reasons such as fatty liver. Fatty liver in the general population is a serious problem affecting 30% of Canadian population. A specific type of fatty liver characterized by much inflammation named nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can lead to cirrhosis and death. Persons living with HIV can be at increased risk of NASH because of toxic effect of certain types of cART on the liver obesity and other metabolic factors (for example diabetes). Some scientific data suggest that newer cART are associated with less fatty liver and liver damage. However NASH has not been studied in detail in persons living with HIV. One reason for the lack of research is one of the only ways to detect liver disease is to undergo liver biopsy which can be painful and has complications. Recently a new non-invasive technology (Fibroscan) has been developed which can tell doctors how much a liver is damaged and how much fat it contains without pain or complications. Moreover a simple test measuring a specific protein in the blood the cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) can help the diagnosis of NASH. We will study the effect of switching cART to newer types of HIV medication in patients with a non-invasive diagnosis of NASH done by Fibroscan and cytokeratin 18. We expect that switching older cART to less hepatotoxic drugs will lead to improvement of liver damage fatty liver and NASH diagnosed by Fibroscan and cytokeratin 18. To evaluate this approach we plan to recruit 58 consenting HIV mono infected patients with non-invasive diagnosis of NASH and/or fatty liver with liver damage. Participants will undergo Fibroscan a blood test for cytokeratin 18 a complete physical examination and laboratory tests every 3 months for 12 months then at 18 and 24 months. The effect of the switching of HIV medications will be recorded. We anticipate that the current study will provide evidence for reduction of inflammation and liver damage with newer cART for treatment of HIV infection.    ,NCT02210715
HIV,Improving Memory Performance by Applying Cognitive Training, The proposed study will test the efficacy of a cognitive training program to improve working memory in a sample of HIV-infected persons. Investigators will assign 40 HIV-infected adults with poor medication adherence to one of two conditions (20/group): the experimental cognitive training intervention or a control training condition. Participants will complete 12 training sessions across 10 weeks and will complete assessments at baseline and post-training. The specific aims are to:   1. Investigate the effects of the cognitive training intervention on working memory and delay discounting in HIV-infected persons. Hypothesis 1: Participants assigned to active cognitive training compared to those in the attention-matched control group will have greater improvements in working memory and reductions in delay discounting.   2. Characterize adherence to antiretroviral medications in this population and examine medication adherence after cognitive training. Hypothesis 2: Participants assigned to active cognitive training compared to those in the attention-matched control group will have greater improvements in medication adherence.    ,NCT02216591
HIV,SSAT061: PK of DTG and EVT/COBI in Healthy Volunteers, The purpose of the study is to look at the levels of three HIV medications: dolutegravir elvitegravir and cobicistat in blood after the drug intake has been stopped in order to understand how long these drugs persist in the blood. The study will specifically look at blood levels of these three drugs after taking them every day for 10 days dolutegravir on a first stage and a combination of elitegravir and cobicistat in a second stage. If the participant decides to take part the duration of the study will be up to 38 days plus a screening visit which will take place up to 28 days prior to the start of the study and a follow up visit which takes place 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study medication.

HIV,Improving the Health of South African Women With Traumatic Stress in HIV Care, In this study the investigators propose to develop Improving AIDS Care after Trauma (ImpACT) an intervention based on theories of stress and coping and evidence-based treatment for traumatic stress. The intervention will target women in South Africa who have histories of sexual trauma and are newly initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in order to reduce avoidant coping and traumatic stress improve care engagement and reduce HIV risk behaviors.    ,NCT02223390
HIV,Reducing Proviral HIV DNA With Interferon-a, The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 2b (peg-IFN-α2b) will reduce the amount of integrated HIV DNA in peripheral blood cells and tissues of individuals with chronic HIV infection receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART). A reduction and/or clearance of the latent viral reservoir (i.e.: virus that remains dormant in HIV-infected subjects receiving suppressive treatment ) is considered essential for HIV eradication. By measuring the changes in integrated proviral HIV DNA which is considered a surrogate measure of the latent reservoir the investigators will establish if peg-IFN-α2b treatment should be considered as a component of future viral eradication strategies.    ,NCT02227277

HIV,Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Dolutegravir in Pregnant HIV Mothers and Their Neonates: A Pilot Study, Aim: To evaluate dolutegravir (DTG) pharmacokinetics in pregnant HIV-infected women Rationale: In developing countries many women present with a new HIV diagnosis in late pregnancy and are at high risk of transmitting infection during delivery. Moreover women may acquire NNRTI resistance from primary transmission or use of nevirapine (NVP) in previous pregnancies. In these circumstances DTG is likely to be more effective in reducing mother to child transmission of HIV than NNRTI-based regimens. Study design: HIV positive pregnant women presenting with untreated HIV infection in late (??8 -36 weeks gestation) pregnancy will be randomised 1:1 to receive DTG (50mg once daily) or standard of care (nevirapine or efavirenz) + 2 NRTIs. PK (0-24h) profile will be sampled in third trimester and post-partum. Although this is primarily a PK study (and has been powered as such) randomisation is included to allow comparison of plasma HIV VL responses against standard of care (NVP or EFV) and is essential for evaluation of secondary endpoints of safety and efficacy of DTG in pregnancy.

HIV,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in HIV, Even in individuals treated for HIV chronic immune activation persists and is associated with increased cardiovascular disease liver disease and mortality. HIV-infected individuals have imbalances in the community of intestinal microbes which is thought to contribute to increased and persistent inflammation. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and durability of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) the transfer of the bacterial community in stool from a healthy donor in HIV+ individuals on anti-retroviral therapy. The study will also measure the effects of FMT on immune activation and inflammatory biomarkers in anti-retroviral treated HIV+ individuals.    ,NCT02256592

HIV,Factors Mediating Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis and Metabolic Disease in HIV Patients., This study plans to learn more about immune responses in intestinal (gut) tissue in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This study will determine whether change in the composition of gut bacteria in HIV infected individuals is related to a high prevalence of chronic gut inflammation and metabolic disease. The investigators will also investigate immune-modulatory properties of specific bacteria that correlate with disease both by characterizing which functional genes are selected for in their genomes and by stimulating immune cells isolated from blood and gut tissue with bacterial isolates. This work will establish whether gain/loss of bacterial drivers/suppressors of information in the gut contributes to metabolic disease in HIV-infected individuals.    ,NCT02258685
HIV,HIV Risk and Prevention in Women, This study gathers information about HIV testing utilization and influences on HIV testing decisions among young general population Russian women at-risk of HIV exposure. The study compares HIV testing acceptance across two types of low-barrier testing strategies (opt-in vs. opt-out) and conducts one of the first randomized experimental comparisons of these strategies. The overarching goal is to gain knowledge that can be used to increase utilization of HIV testing among at-risk young women and offer gender-specific strategies for improving prevention.    ,NCT02263391
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Genetic Factors on the Pharmacokinetics of Antiretroviral Drugs During Pregnancy and Lactation, Mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) during pregnancy and breastfeeding is prevented with maternal antiretroviral drugs (ARV) and infant nevirapine post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). However the pharmacokinetics of certain ARVs is associated with marked inter-individual variability. This variability has been associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding metabolising enzymes transporters and transcriptional regulators. Pregnancy is also associated with additional changes in pharmacokinetics. The resulting sub-therapeutic or supra-therapeutic drug exposures may have serious consequences for virological control MTCT emergence of drug resistance and toxicity. Foetal and infant exposure to maternal ARV during pregnancy and breastfeeding is believed to play a role in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). However such exposures may also result in toxicity. For example efavirenz is contraindicated in children less than 3 years old or 10kg but transferred to breastfed babies through breast milk. On the other hand double exposure to nevirapine from breast milk and PEP may also predispose breastfed infants to nevirapine-associated toxicity. In the proposed study the influence of selected SNPs in certain drug disposition genes on the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz and nevirapine during pregnancy and lactation as well as the level of infant exposure to both drugs through breast milk will be studied. Mathematical models will be developed to predict potential dose optimisation strategies during pregnancy and to predict infant exposure to maternal drugs through breast milk.    ,NCT02269462

HIV,Sleep and Cognition After Atripla to Stribild Switch," Atripla and Stribild are two FDA-Approved one pill a day combination antiretroviral medications given for the treatment of HIV. Both drugs are reasonably well tolerated. However efavirenz a component of Atripla is known to cause ""mental"" side effects. This proposal aims to assess whether a switch from Atripla to Stribild for 12 weeks will be associated with reversal of sleep and cognitive disturbances. Demonstrating changes upon withdrawal of drug and substitution of a drug regimen not known to have an impact on sleep and cognition may represent the best option to determine whether use of efavirenz is associated with effects on sleep and cognition beyond the immediate period following initiation of drug.

HIV,Efavirenz to Dolutegravir Switch in Patients With CNS Toxicity, This is a phase IV open label multicentre trial that will be taking place at 4 sites in the United Kingdom (UK). Efavirenz which is taken in combination with Kivexa® or as part of the combination pill Atripla® is a recommended firstline regimen for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV- 1) infection. Treatment against the HIV virus is also referred to as antiretroviral therapy. Toxicity is the most common reason for modification of firstline therapy. Central Nervous System (CNS) side effects such as difficulty with sleeping & bad dreams are common side effect of Efavirenz based therapy and is one of the most frequent reasons for switching or discontinuing highly active antiretroviral therapy. Dolutegravir is within a novel class of antiretroviral agents licensed in the UK for the treatment of HIV. In combination with Truvada® it showed fewer side effects when compared to Efavirenz in other clinical studies where patients were starting HIV treatment for the first time or switching from other agents. The purpose of the study is to investigate the benefits of switching away from Eefavirenz (in combination with Kivexa® or as part of the combination pill Atripla®) to Dolutegravir in patients with CNS side effects (such as difficulty with sleeping bad dreams etc).    ,NCT02285374

HIV,Intervention to Improve HCV Treatment Uptake and Adherence in HIV/HCV Coinfection," End-stage liver disease predominantly due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the leading causes of death in person living with HIV infection. While HCV is curable and recent advances in treatment have increased the rates of cure few patients with HIV and HCV are being treated to cure HCV. Based on formative research the investigators developed the ""Psychosocial Readiness Evaluation and Preparation for hepatitis C treatment (PREP-C)"". PREP-C is a clinical interview that healthcare providers of diverse disciplines can be trained to administer. It provides an assessment of a client's psychosocial readiness to begin HCV treatment and identifies domains of functioning which require intervention to improve treatment readiness. PREP-C (www.prepC.org) is also a telemedicine resource for health care providers. Under this protocol the existing PREP-C clinical interview (or assessment) is incorporated with a behavioral intervention. This study tests the integrated assessment-behavioral intervention to increase HCV treatment initiation among HIV-co-infected patients. The assessment-behavioral intervention under this protocol is conducted in two phases an Intervention Development phase and a Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) phase. Findings from this vanguard study will inform the design parameters of a larger more rigorous evaluation in an R01 application if results are promising. The PREP-C web-based assessment and intervention package is designed to be scalable and can be disseminated through the live PrepC.org web site. The proposed study is innovative in that it seeks to develop the first web-based intervention for health care providers to use to increase HCV treatment initiation in HIV/HCV-co-infected persons. The study can have a major public health impact by providing needed structured resources for health care providers to increase rates of HCV treatment initiation in HIV/HCV-co-infected persons thereby reducing mortality due to end-stage liver disease.

HIV,Use of Concomitant Medications in HIV-1 Infected Patients in a Large Community Practice in Sydney Australia, For the majority of patients management of HIV-1 infection involves effective and well tolerated antiretroviral therapy with simplified pill load and dosing exemplified by the availability of single tablet regimens (STRs) with single tablet once daily dosing. STR therapy has been shown to improve adherence and reduce hospitalisations (Cohen et al. 2013; Sax et al. 2012). However the aging of the HIV cohort in Australia and globally has raised issues of increasing co-morbidities and consequent polypharmacy to manage these (Jansson & Wilson 2012; Edelman et al. 2013). Polypharmacy may not only impact on adherence but also increases the potential for drug-drug interactions (Holtzman et al. 2013). Stribild a highly effective STR contains cobicistat to boost the levels of the component integrase inhibitor elvitegravir. Cobicistat does not have antiretroviral activity but acts by inhibiting Cyp3A4 of the cytochrome p450 metabolic pathway. Other drugs metabolized via this pathway may be affected by this drug-drug interaction (Rogatto et al. 2014). Additionally there is evidence of increased risk of nephrotoxicity with co-administration of tenofovir and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDS) (Marcotte et al. 2008). Data on use of concomitant medications in Australian patients with HIV is sparse. This study aims to determine in a large caseload community HIV practice the use of concomitant medications in HIV patient pill load and dosing frequency and potential drug-drug interactions with stribild.    ,NCT02295384
HIV,Intermittent ART in Primary HIV Infection, Interventions during primary HIV infection (PHI) can modify the immune control and the clinical evolution during the chronic phase. Although several studies suggest the benefit of antiretroviral treatment (ART) during PHI indication of ART is still not universally recommended. The investigators randomized patients with PHI with a favourable immunological profile and well controlled on ART to undergone structured treatment interruptions alone or with low doses of IL-2 stopping ART thereafter. The endpoints were immune control of HIV replication and time to resume ART. Immunological profile specific CD4 and CD8 responses and clinical data were analysed for both groups up to 48 weeks and during a long follow-up up to nine years since final ART stop.    ,NCT02300623
HIV,Trial to Evaluate the Interest of a Reductive Anti Retroviral Strategy Using Dual Therapy Inspite of Triple Therapy," In the early 2000s the ""TRILEGE©"" study was realized to determine if the reductive anti retroviral strategy from an initial triple therapy (based on a protease inhibitor as the third agent) towards a dual therapy of nucleoside analogs (in particular the association of ""zidovudine +lamivudine"") for patients infected by HIV and stabilized for at least 3 months at a threshold value of 400 copies/ml would allow to obtain a well-controlled plasmatic viral load with an aim to reduce the long-term side effects of the treatment. The afore mentioned study showed that the reductive anti retroviral strategy was a failure. No study has as yet to revaluate this strategy in particular in the current context of antiretroviral treatments. Indeed modern nucleoside inhibitors (Kivexa® Truvada®) have extended half-lives as well as a superior intrinsic power as compared to treatments proposed in the initial ""TRILEGE©"" study. Furthermore the better quality of current triple therapy (as compared to that used 10 years ago) has lead to substantial viral reservoir reduction. Currently a small number of patients is being successfully treated in the long-term (viral load < 20 copies/ml) using nucleoside analog dual therapy. The particular characteristics of these patients have yet to be thoroughly investigated. The patients concerned were all treated prematurely before ever passing below 200 lymphocytes T CD4/mm3. It occurred that all these patients presented a low viral reservoir as measured by HIV DNA quantification (< 27 log copies/106 PBMC). Therefore by targeting patients who have (1) a strong immune restoration (2) a low HIV DNA value and (3) a very good observance the investigators emit the hypothesis that reductive anti retroviral strategy that would consist in changing from a conventional triple therapy towards a Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors dual therapy could allow for durable control of viral replication with the concomitant benefice of reduced antiretroviral side effects and cost.

HIV,Tenofovir Pharmacology in Older HIV Infected Individuals, Tenofovir continues to play a vital role in the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and as the age of the HIV-infected population increases in the United States and worldwide there is an urgent need to understand the extent to which older age influences the way this antiretroviral medication works in the body. The investigators study aims to characterize and compare the pharmacology of tenofovir in older versus younger HIV-infected adults and to assess kidney function over the course of approximately one year. The investigators will be analyzing tenofovir levels in different compartments of the blood and in hair samples and will be assessing the relationship between tenofovir concentrations and changes in kidney function over time in the older and younger cohorts. Lastly the investigators will be evaluating the relationship between tenofovir concentrations and functional status (including body composition bone mineral density and frailty) in study participants.    ,NCT02304263

HIV,Using Cultural Ceremonies to Reduce Intimate Partner Violence and HIV Transmission, Violence against women (VAW) the most extreme manifestation of the unequal power balance between women and men is a major global public health concern. One of the most common forms of VAW is that perpetrated by a husband or other intimate partner. In Ethiopia 70.9% of women reported having experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) in their lifetime demonstrating the pervasiveness of the problem. A growing body of evidence has also linked IPV and HIV risk. This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of a community-based intervention focused on Intimate Partner Violence and HIV delivered in the context of the Ethiopian coffee ceremony a culturally established forum for community discussion and conflict resolution. Villages will be randomly assigned to one of 4 study arms (3 intervention and one control arm): 1) Women only participate in the intervention 2) Men only participate 3) Both men and women (couples) participate 4) Women and men receive the control intervention comprising a short informational session on violence reduction.    ,NCT02311699
HIV,PET/CT Imaging Companion Study To ACTG A5314," HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) likely due to chronically increased inflammation. Low-dose methotrexate (LDMTX) may reduce CVD risk in people with rheumatoid arthritis who like those with HIV have increased levels of inflammation. The NHLBI is funding a clinical trial targeting the excess inflammation in HIV. That ""Parent Study"" is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial that will assess whether 24-week treatment with LDMTX: i) is safe ii) reduces circulating inflammatory biomarkers and levels of immune cell activation and iii) improves brachial artery reactivity. However neither the biomarkers nor endothelial function tests measured as part of the parent study will report on atherosclerotic inflammation (the desired pathobiological target of LDMTX therapy in HIV). As such the direct evaluation of arterial inflammation would substantially enhance the scientific value of the trial. In this imaging sub-study the overall goal is to determine if treating virologically suppressed HIV-infected individuals with LDMTX will reduce inflammation within the arterial wall. This fully integrated ancillary study would in a subset of patients enrolled in the parent trial: (i) assess the impact of LDMTX on arterial inflammation (ii) evaluate mechanisms responsible for arterial inflammation in HIV and iii) explore mechanisms responsible for actions of LDMTX on the artery wall. Accordingly the proposed study would provide unique and highly complementary information that would greatly increase the knowledge and mechanistic insights gained from Parent Study. The ancillary study has two specific aims1) To determine the impact of anti-inflammatory treatment with LDMTX on arterial inflammation as assessed by FDG-PET/CT imaging in virally suppressed HIV-infected individuals. and 2) To evaluate the cellular and biochemical basis of the effect of LDMTX therapy on arterial inflammation in HIV.

Our goal is to determine whether offering counseling beyond Brief Advice namely MI has greater alcohol reduction effects. In the proposed randomized trial all 300 HIV-HCV co-infected participants will receive BA delivered by their HIV PCP during a regular HIV visit and will then be randomized to either a 30-minute Motivational Interviewing Intervention with a Behavioral Counselor (MI) or to HIV clinic treatment-as-usual. After this initial meeting drinking ""check-in"" (MI or BA) sessions will then be provided telephonically every three months for 18 months with a final assessment at 24 months.

HIV,SteadyRx: Smartphone ART Adherence Intervention for Drug Users, Antiretroviral therapy (ART) increases life expectancy and quality of life for individuals infected with HIV and can reduce the chance of HIV transmission but a high degree of adherence to ART is required to achieve these benefits. Unfortunately only 59% of patients in North America report ART adherence >90%. Thus ART adherence interventions are a critical part of the fight against HIV/AIDS. Injection drug use and crack cocaine use are major factors in the transmission of HIV and are associated with non-adherence to ART. Several types of interventions most notably directly administered antiretroviral therapy (direct observation of antiretroviral administration and patient supports) and contingency management (the provision of incentives contingent upon objective evidence of adherence) have been effective in promoting ART adherence in drug users. However a core problem with all ART adherence interventions is that their effects do not last after the interventions are discontinued. The common finding of post-intervention dissipation of effects suggests that ART adherence interventions may need to be long-term or even permanent adjuncts to ART for drug users. We intend to develop an intensive intervention that incorporates the most effective techniques for promoting ART adherence in drug users and delivers them in a manner that allows for their large-scale implementation as long-term or even permanent adjuncts to ART. Thus we will bundle a targeted group of effective component interventions into a smartphone application that is easy for patients to use simple to manage and maximally convenient for all stakeholders. Our ultimate goal is to produce an intervention that is highly effective and scalable. Toward that end the SteadyRX intervention to be developed under this project will be largely automated and will (1) facilitate consultation with care providers (2) provide reminders when a dose is overdue (3) provide electronic remote observation of medication-taking and (4) reward ART adherence. In addition to developing this smartphone-based intervention a pilot study will be conducted in 50 HIV+ adults with a detectable viral load who use drugs or are in drug treatment. In this study participants will be randomly assigned to receive usual care or usual care plus the SteadyRX intervention.    ,NCT02317614

HIV,Bioequivalence of Crushed Stribild With a Normal Breakfast or With Drip Feed Compared to the Whole Tablet," Elvitegravir is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor which is marketed in a fixed dose combination tablet with cobicistat tenofovir and emtricitabine (Stribild® referred to as STB). For patients with swallowing difficulties administration of whole tablets can be problematic and tablets are cut or crushed to ease administration. In addition if HIV patients develop opportunistic infections patients can become severely ill and may end up on the intensive care. Patients at the intensive care might not be able to swallow medication. Therefore it is useful to know if it is possible to administer STB through a different route like a feeding tube. If STB can be crushed or dissolved and given through a catheter it is also useful to know if it can be given with drip feed. Currently there is no information about crushing STB tablets. ""Crushing STB tablets into a liquid medium has not been studied and is not recommended"" according to the SPC text. Depending on the biopharmaceutical characteristics of a drug formulation crushing tablets can lead to altered pharmacokinetics of drugs. It is important to know whether pharmacokinetics are influenced by crushing of tablets as low concentrations are associated with virologic failure. Therefore higher doses might be needed. In addition higher Cmax and/or exposure can lead to toxicity. As a result therapeutic drug monitoring is advised or crushing the drug is a contra-indication based on the available data. It has been shown that simultaneous oral ingestion of antacids and elvitegravir gives a decrease in Cmax and AUC of elvitegravir. This interaction is not shown for co-ingestion with omeprazole. Which makes it unlikely that this interaction is caused by a pH-lowering effect influencing the absorption of elvitegravir. It is probably a local gastrointestinal complexation phenomenon similar to what has been observed with other HIV integrase inhibitors. A possible pharmacokinetic interaction between elvitegravir and complexation formers may be expected. Especially considering the active binding sites of elvitegravir which bind magnesium metal ion cofactors. Although there is data that STB can be ingested with a protein rich drink it is unclear if foods or liquids containing high amounts of magnesium or other cations can cause this same interaction. Therefore this study will be conducted to investigate whether crushed and suspended STB and crushed and suspended STB with drip feed are bioe-quivalent to taking STB as a whole.    ",NCT02325934

HIV,Developing and Assessing a Community Based Model of Antiretroviral Care, Tremendous efforts and resources have been expended by the global community to ensure that antiretroviral therapy (ART) is available and accessible to all that need it. Despite these less than a half of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients requiring ART in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are receiving it. Some of the most significant barriers to attaining universal access to ART in this region include large distances that patients have to travel to clinic time spent in accessing care and a significant shortage of human resources. In order to address these challenges the World Health Organization (WHO) advocates alternative care models especially those that incorporate task-shifting to lower cadre health care workers and lay persons. Unfortunately few such alternative care models have been identified and very little data exist on their long-term outcomes. With this project we will develop and assess an alternative care model that is established on the platform of a HIV-infected peer-group (ART Co-op) and facilitated by community health workers (CHW's). This model of care is intended to decentralize ART services and bring them closer to the patients. Specifically we will:   1. Develop an acceptable and sustainable model for extending HIV care and treatment into the community.   2. Perform a pilot study comparing the outcomes of patients enrolled in the ART Co-ops program to those receiving standard of care.   3. Determine the cost savings and cost effectiveness of ART Co-ops.    ,NCT02337504

HIV,An Adaptive Strategy for Preventing and Treating Lapses of Retention in Adult HIV Care (AdaPT-R) in Nyanza Kenya, Retaining HIV-infected patients in care is critical but loss to follow-up after enrolment often reaches 20%-40% by two years placing millions of patients at risk of poor outcomes. A strategy to optimize retention within resource constraints is urgently needed. Sequential adaptive strategies - a novel class of public health approaches - may offer a solution. A candidate sequential adaptive strategy would start with a less expensive intervention (e.g. SMS) in all patients and then apply a more costly and intensive one (e.g. navigator) only to patients who show early signs of poor retention. This study involves a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial to evaluate a family of such strategies. the investigators will randomize 2500 adults newly initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART) at 4 HIV clinics in the Nyanza region of Kenya to (1) standard of care routine education and counselling (REC) (2) SMS text messages or (3) transport vouchers. Patients with early signs of weakening retention (defined as the first time a patient is 14 days late for an appointment) will be re-randomized to (1) a single episode of outreach (standard of care) (2) SMS combined with vouchers or (3) a peer navigator. Patients not successfully contacted by 28 days after missed visit (and not verified to have left the area or transferred to another clinic) will also be rerandomized to of one the same three re-engagement interventions. Individuals randomized at first stage to SMS or voucher that do not miss a visit by at least 14 days in the first 12 months of follow up will be re-randomized at 12 months to stop first stage intervention or continue with that same intervention to 24 months. The investigators primary objective is to assess the comparative effectiveness of sequenced intervention strategies to prevent initial lapses in retention and to treat those that occur. The investigators primary endpoint is alive and virologically suppressed two years after enrolment. In addition the investigators will assess the comparative effectiveness of first-stage strategies (REC SMS voucher) to prevent lapses in retention and the comparative effectiveness of second stage strategies (outreach SMS + voucher navigator) to re-engage patients after initial lapse. This study will also compare outcomes among patients who continue versus discontinue the SMS and voucher interventions including a small complementarity component utilizing qualitative methods to examine the voucher approach and the effects of discontinuing this approach after success among a subset of participants. At study conclusion the investigators output will be a menu of adaptive strategies for retention accompanied by estimates of cost and effectiveness which policy makers in different settings can use to advance the impact of HIV care and treatment programs in Africa.    ,NCT02338739
HIV,CogStim a Pilot Study : Cognitive Rehabilitation Management of HIV-1 Mild Cognitively Impaired Patients Controlled With Antiretroviral Therapy, Despite undetectable plasma viral load under treatment about 30% of HIV infected patients show asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment or minor cognitive disorder. These symptoms impact the compliance of the treatment though its performance and daily life quality. To this day no therapy tested has proved its efficiency including the strategy of the antiretroviral therapy (cART) optimization according to the Cerebral Penetration effectiveness Score (CPE). Description of the study: an open prospective comparative monocentric pilote study randomised in three groups which investigates the efficiency of a 6 months-cognitive rehabilitation program on improving asymptomatic or minor cognitive disorder for undetectable HIV+ patients. This study gathers HIV-1 patients undetectable under stable cART with a good cerebral penetration who develop asymptomatic or minor cognitive disorders connected to HIV infection. Those who have severe psychiatric disorder or who are on medication that could interfere with psychometrical tests will be excluded.

HIV,Texting to Improve Testing (TextIT):," Early accurate diagnosis is one of the first crucial steps in care for infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) relies upon early diagnosis and results in significant reductions in infant morbidity and mortality. The investigators recently concluded a successful randomized controlled trial in Kenya entitled ""Improving uptake of early infant diagnosis of HIV for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT): a randomized trial of a text messaging intervention"" (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT01433185). In this study text messages developed using a behavioral theoretical framework significantly improved maternal attendance at post-partum clinic appointments and rates of testing to facilitate early infant diagnosis of HIV in a selected population and controlled setting. Understanding the effectiveness of this intervention (and its limitations) in a real-world routine-care setting represents the next step in the translational pathway to public health impact. The investigators therefore now propose a cluster randomized stepped wedge trial in 20 clinics operated by the Kenyan Ministry of Health in the Nyanza region of Kenya and use the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation and Maintenance (REAIM) framework to understand the effectiveness of the text messaging to improve testing (TextIT) intervention. Our specific aims are:   1. To determine the effect of TextIT on maternal attendance at postpartum clinic visits during the randomized stepped-wedge rollout of the intervention. Hypothesis 1: A greater proportion of women at health facilities implementing TextIT will attend clinic within eight weeks postpartum compared to women at health facilities implementing standard care.   2. To determine the effect of TextIT on virological infant HIV testing within eight weeks after birth during the randomized stepped-wedge rollout of the intervention. Hypothesis 2: Infants of women at health facilities implementing TextIT will be more likely to have virological HIV testing compared to infants of women at health facilities implementing standard care.   3. To determine the costs and cost-effectiveness of TextIT. The investigators will estimate the cost per patient and per health gain achieved (disability-adjusted life year DALY) comparing TextIT to current standard care. Hypothesis 3: The TextIT intervention will be more cost-effective than current standard care.    ",NCT02350140
HIV,A Pilot Voucher Incentive for Improving Retention in Postpartum HIV Care in South Africa, Given there is substantial loss to follow-up soon after delivery among HIV-positive pregnant women in South Africa we will conduct a pilot study of an innovative approach to improve retention in care targeted to this specific population at high risk of drop-out. The problem of poor retention in care is well documented but interventions to address the issue are lacking. In order to design an effective intervention that will be tested in a future randomized controlled trial we will first complete preliminary research via a pilot study in order to determine the feasibility and acceptability of an incentive program (i.e. a supermarket voucher) to reduce loss to follow-up among HIV-positive women after delivery. The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of a voucher incentive intervention aimed at improving retention in postpartum HIV care Secondary objectives include: a) to determine the efficacy of the intervention at increasing postpartum retention; b) to determine the acceptability of the intervention in terms of women's preferences for the intervention compared to other possible interventions; c) to assess differences in patient retention among women newly diagnosed with HIV vs. those who knew their HIV-positive status before pregnancy; and d) to assess differences in patient retention among women who initiated ART during pregnancy vs. those who were on ART before becoming pregnant. We will enroll up to 200 adult (??8 years) pregnant HIV-positive women attending antenatal care who have not previously enrolled in the study at Hikhensile Clinic Johannesburg South Africa. The study will be a prospective intervention cohort study with historical controls. Intervention subjects will receive a one-time supermarket voucher of R50 (about $5.00) for participants who return for at least one postpartum visit at the study clinic within 10 weeks of delivery.    ,NCT02351362
HIV,Renal Integrase Study, The purpose of this study is to observe the safety of Truvada® (TDF/FTC) in relation to its impact on kidney function combined with different Integrase Inhibitors (Dolutegravir or Elvitegravir/Cobicistat or Raltegravir) when given to patients who are commencing treatment for HIV infection for the first time. All three combinations (Raltegravir + Truvada® Dolutegravir + Truvada® and Stribild® a single pill which contains Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Truvada®) are currently recommended by the national guide-lines and used in standard clinical practice.    ,NCT02351908
HIV,Targeted Clinical Strategies and Low Level Viraemia (LLV) in Boosted Protease Inhibitor Therapy, The purpose of the study is to look at possible reasons why some HIV positive people who take their drugs properly and have no resistance to these drugs still have low amounts of virus detectable in their blood. This is known as Low Level Viraemia (LLV). When low levels of HIV virus are present some can mutate and make the drugs less effective (i.e. some variants of the virus become more resistant). Currently however these resistance mutations may be difficult to detect using standard tests for resistance because the amount of virus in the blood is very low and the standard tests aren't sensitive enough to pick up the mutations. The investigators will use more sensitive mutation detection methods known as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to look at whether see if there are any low levels of drug resistant HIV virus developing in the blood when LLV occurs. The investigators will look at the different treatment strategies that are used in routine standard practice when LLV is detected and evaluate which is most effective in preventing development of resistance. The investigators hope this research will help to inform guidelines on the best way to treat HIV in the future.    ,NCT02354209
HIV,An Extension of Protocol PRO 140_CD01 TS Study, This study is a Phase 2b multi-center extension study designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy safety and tolerability of PRO 140 monotherapy for the maintenance of viral suppression in patients who were stable on combination antiretroviral therapy and completed 12 weeks of treatment under PRO140_CD01 Treatment Substitution Study without experiencing virologic failure. Consenting patients will continue to receive PRO 140 monotherapy for 160 additional weeks. Total treatment duration with PRO 140 will be up to 161 weeks with one week overlap of existing retroviral regimen and PRO 140 at the end of the treatment extension phase in subjects who do not experience virologic failure.    ,NCT02355184
HIV,Substance Use Disorders in HIV People of Cameroon, Background: Data are scarce concerning injecting drug use (IDU) and alcohol consumption among HIV-infected people on highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) in Cameroon. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of alcohol consumption and IDU among HIV-infected people on HAART; to determine sociodemographic factors associated with alcohol abuse and IDU among people on HAART; and to determine impact of alcohol consumption and IDU on adherence to HAART. Methods/Design: The investigators will conduct a cross sectional study at the Yaoundé Central Hospital in Cameroon from February to August 2015. Using a self-report questionnaire the investigators will include at least 1000 HIV-infected adults (18 years or more) on HAART for at least one month coming for HIV care. The investigators will exclude pregnant women. Data collection will include sociodemographic and economic profile alcohol consumption using Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test injecting drug use adherence to HAART using visual analog scale and self-rate report. The investigators will perform sub-analysis for sex group and area of habitation. A p value < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Discussion: There is a critical need of accurate estimates of the amplitude and the distribution of IDU and alcohol consumption among HIV-infected adults in order to inform health policies maker for curbing burden of both injecting drug use and alcohol consumption among people living with HIV.    ,NCT02356185

HIV,Antibodies and Memory Cells Role After Different Pneumococcal Vaccines in HIV Adults, Streptococcus pneumoniae is a cause of high morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive subjects representing the leading etiological agent of severe bacterial pneumonia. International guidelines recommend that HIV positive patients aged >=19 years who are 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) naïve should receive a single dose of PCV13. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23-valent (PPV23) should be given >=8 weeks after indicated dose of PCV13 and a second dose of PPV23 should be given 5 years later. For those who previously received PPV23 PCV13 should be administered >=1 year after the last PPV23 dose. HIV infection affects humoral immunity both through reduced T-cell help and changes in the B-cell compartment. Neither amount of circulating memory B cells nor their functions are restored by antiretroviral therapy: this may affect antibody mediated immunity even in well-treated HIV patients. In asplenic childrens a single dose of PCV13 seems sufficient to restore the pool of anti-pneumococcal polysaccharides IgG memory B cells. In adults it has been reported that a single dose of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine induces significant increases in serotype-specific memory B-cell populations conversely immunization with PPV23 seems to decrease memory B-cell frequency. However data on immunological response after PCV13 in HIV positive adults are still scanty and the optimal pneumococcal prophylaxis strategy needs further investigation. Number of PCV13 doses is actually demanded to clinical judgment for each patient; also current Italian indications recommend at least one dose but till 3 doses seem to be suggested for immunocompromised patients. Present study aims to investigate short and long term immunological response after different standard vaccine schedule and to evaluate pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization in vaccinated patients.    ,NCT02357823
HIV,Suppression of HIV 1 RNA in People Living With HIV, The investigators propose to evaluate a novel incentive intervention to promote suppression of viral load in people living with HIV that will employ empirically-based parameters that have been proven critical to the effectiveness of incentive interventions. Participants (N = 200) from medical clinics that serve adults living with HIV in Baltimore will be randomly assigned to an Incentive or a Usual Care Control group. Incentive group participants will receive incentives for maintaining suppressed and undetectable viral loads. The incentive program will employ high magnitude incentives provide incentives for decreases in viral load early in treatment before a patient's viral load has reached undetectable levels arrange frequent incentives early in treatment and reduce the frequency of incentives as participants achieve progressively longer periods of viral load suppression arrange a schedule of escalating incentives for sustained suppression of viral load and the intervention will be maintained for two years. Usual Care Control participants will only receive the standard HIV medical care offered in their clinic. Assessments will be conducted every 3 months throughout the two years of treatment and every 6 months throughout the year following treatment. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of participants that have undetectable viral loads at the 3-month assessments conducted throughout the 2-year intervention period. Secondary measures will include adherence to HIV care and post-treatment outcomes. The investigators will also assess moderators and mediators of the effects of the incentives on the suppression of viral load and conduct cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses. If the incentive intervention maintains suppressed viral load and is economically sound it could be used to improve the health of adults living with HIV reduce health care costs and reduce HIV transmission in the community.    ,NCT02363387

HIV,Optimization of the ex Vivo Challenge: Reproductive Infections and Contraception, The development of surrogates to predict HIV prevention product safety and efficacy is a high priority. An ex vivo challenge model is one such promising surrogate. Colonic tissue exposed to rectally applied microbicides in vivo and then challenged with HIV in the lab showed significant reduction in HIV replication when compared to tissue exposed to placebo gel. Currently the ex vivo challenge model for ectocervical and vaginal tissue is under development at the Dezzutti lab at the Magee Womens Research Institute in Pittsburgh PA. Currently the Reproductive Infectious Disease Research Group is conducting a study designed to answer important questions about the ex vivo challenge model:which HIV virus is the best to use in the laboratory and what is the best indicator of HIV infection. The proposed study delineated here will investigate the effect of BV HSV and contraceptive use on the model . There will be two arms to the study; the first will investigate the impact of HSV and BV status and the second contraceptive use. Vaginal and cervical biopsies will be collected from participants for the ex vivo challenge model.    ,NCT02375425

HIV,Copenhagen Co-morbidity in HIV Infection Study, Despite efficient antiretroviral treatment for HIV infection decrease in life expectancy remains. Excess mortality is mainly due to non-AIDS co-morbidity including cardiovascular pulmonary and liver related diseases. Both HIV-unrelated and HIV-related risk factors probably contribute to this pattern. At present most evidence regarding co-morbidity in HIV infection rely on cross-study comparisons of HIV-infected persons with published population rates and few prospective studies in U.S. cohorts. Using well characterized participants from the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) as controls we aim to include >1500 HIV-infected persons in the COCOMO study to determine if co-morbidity is more prevalent or develops at a higher rate in HIV-infected persons. The study will asses 1) cardiovascular 2) pulmonary and 3) liver-related co-morbidity using uniformly collected data in the two cohorts. The investigators aim to study the relative impact of HIV-unrelated and HIV-related factors on development of co-morbidity.    ,NCT02382822
HIV,Effects of Raltegravir Based Regimen on Platelet Reactivity Platelet-monocyte Aggregation and Immune Activation, Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIVinfected individuals. The precise mechanisms underlying this increased cardiovascular risk remain to be elucidated. Platelet hyperreactivity and increased platelet-monocyte aggregation (PMA) are found in HIVinfectedpatients and may contribute to the excess cardiovascular risk as platelets play a key role in the onset and progression of atherosclerosis and in acute cardiovascular events. In addition HIV-infected individuals frequently suffer from persistent immune activation and inflammation. In a crosssectional study the investigators recently showed that individuals using a regimen containing the integrase inhibitor raltegravir have reduced platelet hyperreactivity and PMA compared to other antiretroviral regimens. Other recent studies showed that raltegravir is associated with decreased immune activation. Due to the inherent limitations of cross sectional studies the investigators aim to expand our findings in an intervention study. The investigators will conduct a randomized control trial where the investigators switch patients to a integrase containing treatment regimen to assay possible changes in platelet function and persistent immune activation. Knowledge gathered in the proposed study can help understand and prevent cardiovascular disease in patients treated for a HIV infection by reducing platelet hyperreactivity and persistent immune activation.    ,NCT02383355

We will compare partner testing rates in intervention and control groups.    ,NCT02386215
HIV,A T Cell-based HIV Vaccine," The purpose of this research study is to develop a vaccine against Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) a disease that causes AIDS in people. The investigator will be looking at viruses similar to HIV in animals. Since these viruses are very similar to HIV the blood from humans who have been exposed to HIV will be tested to see if the immune system will recognize the HIV and prevent infection. HIV targets the immune system by attacking certain T cells called CD4+ T cells. There are parts on the AIDS viruses that help the virus infect these cells and other parts that help the immune system prevent viral infection by activating protective T-cells that fight HIV. Different T-cell populations are very important in most vaccines as they act as ""effectors"" that work as part of the immune system to recognize and fight off HIV infection. When effector T cells are activated by appropriate ""protective"" part(s) of the virus they either block HIV from reproducing or kill HIV infected cells. By finding these common protective parts of each of these human and animal AIDS viruses the investigator hopes to make a vaccine that helps the immune system prevent HIV infection by avoiding parts that attack CD4+ T cells and may worsen HIV infection and selecting for parts that stimulate effector T cells that fight HIV infection.

HIV,Improving HIV and Alcohol-Related Outcomes Among HIV+ Persons in Clinic Settings, Alcohol use is increasingly recognized as a key factor in morbidity and mortality among HIV-positive individuals and represents an important public health concern given its associations with medication non-adherence increases in viral load poor immunologic outcomes (lower CD4 counts) drug resistance lower health care utilization comorbidities (HIV/viral hepatitis coinfection) and poor health outcomes overall. Adherence to HIV medications has a double public health benefit both in terms of slowing disease progression and improving health outcomes among HIV-positive individuals and in helping to curb the sexual transmission of HIV. The objective of this study is to implement a multisite comparative effectiveness trial in real-world clinical settings with three intensities of treatment to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of an efficacious theory-based behavioral intervention (PLUS) in improving ART-adherence and alcohol-related outcomes among HIV-positive individuals who drink alcohol at harmful or hazardous levels.

HIV,Postpartum Adherence Clubs to Enhance Support: the PACER Study," The Western Cape province of South Africa (SA) is changing the way it treats pregnant women with HIV. Now all HIV-infected pregnant women regardless of how sick or healthy they are will receive antiretroviral treatment (ART) for life (""Option B+""). However there are few well-developed models of service delivery to support this change to ""Option B+"" in the Western Cape and many parts of the continent. The parent study -- Strategies to Optimize ART Services for Maternal & Child Health (MCH-ART)-- is testing two clinic-based models of service delivery for Option B+ . To complement MCH-ART this study PACER will test whether community-based Adherence Clubs are an effective model for keeping breastfeeding women in HIV care after pregnancy. These clubs have been used to free up space at ART clinics by moving stable HIV+ patients to community-based services but they have not been studied as an effective strategy among breastfeeding women after delivery.

HIV,A Study of the Gut Barrier and Blood Vessel Inflammation in Individuals With and Without HIV," The purpose of this research study is to determine whether teduglutide can repair a ""leaky"" gut decrease inflammation and prevent or treat plaque a build-up of fat and other materials in the blood vessels of the heart in people with HIV. HIV disease is linked to inflammatory changes and leakiness of the gut. These changes or conditions may increase the risk of developing heart and blood vessel disease. The investigators believe teduglutide can help repair the gut barrier in people with HIV leading to a decrease in inflammation and plaque in the blood vessels of the heart.    ",NCT02431325
HIV,Latency and Early Neonatal Provision of Antiretroviral Drugs Clinical Trial, The investigators propose a non-randomized clinical trial of 60 HIV-infected infants identified within 48 hours of birth and their mothers to investigate the consequences of very early ART on the establishment and maintenance of the viral reservoir. The first phase (early ART initiation within 48 hours of birth) will examine the trajectory i.e. changes over time of the viral reservoir and detection of HIV-specific antibody responses in infants testing HIV-positive within 48 hours of birth and initiating early ART. Secondary pathogenesis aims will test whether markers of neonatal immune quiescence are associated with the extent of seeding and rate of decline of the viral reservoir when ART is started at a young age and investigate whether markers in infant stool samples can be used as a non-invasive method of defining relevant immune and HIV-specific parameters associated with viral reservoir size. The investigators hypothesize that developmental characteristics of newborn immunity may make this period the optimal time to begin ART and influence the seeding of the viral reservoir.    ,NCT02431975
HIV,A Pilot Study Comparing the Immunogenicity of Fendrix vs. Double-dose Engerix B in HIV-infected Non-responders to Standard Hepatitis B Vaccination Courses, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can result in a greater risk of adverse outcomes in HIV-infected individuals including more rapid progression to cirrhosis and associated complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma. For this reason as well as the shared routes of transmission between the two viruses UK and International guidance recommends that all HBV-negative HIV-infected individuals be offered vaccination against HBV. Unfortunately response rates in this population can be as low as 17.5 - 40% to standard vaccination courses. To improve this response strategies such as the use of double dose of standard vaccines (e.g. Engerix B) is recommended in several guidelines for previous non-responders although there is currently limited evidence for this approach. An alternative strategy is to use vaccines with novel adjuvants such as Fendrix and observational clinical data in the Investigators HIV cohort suggests that response rates can be as high as 81% of individuals achieving HBV surface antibody (HBsAb) levels >100 in a group that did not respond to previous standard HBV vaccine courses. However the cost of Fendrix is considerably higher than Engerix B and controlled trials are required to confirm whether this approach is warranted. Furthermore insights into the potential mechanisms by which Fendrix may elicit better responses would be valuable in optimising future vaccine strategies in this population. The Investigators propose to conduct a randomised open label active-controlled pilot study comparing double dose Engerix B and Fendrix in HIV-infected non-responders to standard HBV vaccine courses which will provide the necessary data to design and power a larger multicentre randomised controlled trial. Outcome measures will include the proportion of individuals seroconverting with HBsAb levels >100 following each vaccination course the magnitude and quality of the HBV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses elicited by each vaccine and the durability of the HBsAb response at 1 year following the end of vaccination.    ,NCT02434848

HIV,Epidemic History and Iatrogenic Transmission of Blood-borne Viruses in Mid-20th Century Kinshasa, Kinshasa Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is where human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) appears to have most diversified. The factors that lead to jumpstarting the HIV-1 epidemic remain unclear; mounting evidence suggests medical interventions may have contributed. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) are viruses compatible with long-term survival but with broadly similar modes of transmission as HIV. The main objective was to assess the association of past intravenous treatment with HCV and HTLV-1 seropositivity. The investigators hypothesized that medical interventions in the mid-20th century may have facilitated the emergence of HIV-1 in central Africa. To assess the association of injectable treatments with HCV and HTLV-1 infection and to reconstruct past virus dynamics the investigators conducted a cross-sectional study of 839 elderly long-term inhabitants of Kinshasa with serological assays followed by amplification and sequencing. Risk factors were assessed through logistic regression. Phylogenetic methods were used to reconstruct the epidemic history of HCV.    ,NCT02439918
HIV,iLink (Incentives for Linkage to ART) Study: A Mixed-methods Study to Improve Linkage to HIV Care, The iLink Study examines whether a Conditional Economic Incentive (CEI) may be an effective tool for improving linkage to HIV treatment and care following referral for antiretroviral therapy (ART) services from a mobile health clinic in Cape Town South Africa. The study examines the feasibility and acceptability of using a R300 (approximately $25 as of April 2015) voucher - that is exchanged for cash upon initiation of ART within 3 months - to increase the uptake of ART among men and women living in low-income areas.

HIV,Effects of Pitavastatin on Lipid Profiles in HIV-infected Patients With Dyslipidemia and Receiving Atazanavir/Ritonavir, Dyslipidemia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an increasing problem in HIV-infected patients who are on antiretroviral therapy especially protease inhibitors including atazanavir. Pitavastatin is a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with lesser drug-drug interactions and demonstrable efficacy in decreasing lipid levels in non HIV-infected individuals. The study was conducted as a randomized double-blind crossover study comparing the safety and efficacy of pitavastatin versus placebo in HIV-infected patients with dyslipidemia and receiving atazanavir/ritonavir. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or pitavastatin for 12 weeks underwent a 2-week washout period and then were given the other treatment for an additional 12 weeks. Patients were observed for lipid profiles including total cholesterol (TC) triglyceride (TG) low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL); and the side effects including clinical and laboratory (serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK)). The follow-up visits were every 4 weeks until the end of the study.    ,NCT02442700
HIV,Toll-like Receptor 9 Agonist Treatment in Chronic HIV-1 Infection, Combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) effectively suppresses virus replication and partially restores immune functions. However cART cannot cure HIV infection. This study aim to investigate whether the antiviral immune response can be enhanced and/or viral transcription reactivated with MGN1703. MGN1703 is an agonist to toll-like receptor (TLR) 9. Activation of TLR9 has been shown to augment innate and adaptive immune effector functions most notably enhanced NK cell and T cell functions. Furthermore TLR9 agonists have been shown in vitro to reactivate viral transcription in latently infected cells potentially leading to enhanced recognition of infected cells by the immune effector cells.    ,NCT02443935

HIV,Pilot Study of Oral Probiotic Bacteria Supplementation to Reduce Chronic Immune Activation in HIV-infected Malian Women," The composition of the intestinal bacterial flora effects gut immunologic function and intestinal barrier integrity. HIV infection impairs gut immune and epithelial function resulting in an altered gut bacterial flora and ""leakage"" of gut bacterial products into the bloodstream. These bacterial products can overstimulate the immune system leading to increased inflammation and HIV disease progression. The investigators will investigate whether oral supplementation of certain beneficial ""probiotic"" bacteria may attenuate these processes in HIV infected women in Mali Africa. This is a single arm study to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of combination oral probiotic supplementation (VSL#3 Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals - containing 9 × 1011 bacteria of 8 species: S. thermophilus Bifidobacterium breve Bifidobacterium longum Bifidobacterium infantis Lactobacillus plantarum Lactobacillus acidophilus Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus bulgaricus) on plasma biomarkers of immune cell activation and inflammation. The study population will be 50 chronically HIV-infected but generally healthy non-pregnant Malian women subjects with CD4+ T-cell count ??350 cells/mm3 who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy. Blood plasma/serum and fecal sampling will occur at baseline 4 and 12 week as well as at 24 weeks. At these time points probiotic will be dispensed a medical history will be obtained and adherence will be assessed. Prior to study entry subjects will have eligibility and safety labs will be obtained and detailed baseline medical and symptom histories demographics weight and stool frequency information will be recorded. A stress assessment questionnaire will be completed at baseline and week 12 to determine the effect of this intervention on stress levels. The primary study outcome is to assess change (baseline to 12 week) in plasma soluble CD14 (a marker of monocyte response to bacterial endotoxin which has been associated with mortality) with study probiotic. Other outcomes will include assessing change (baseline to 12 week) in plasma interleukin-6 soluble CD163 (another monocyte activation marker) d-dimer (a marker of coagulopathy) intestinal fatty acid binding protein (a marker of gut epithelial cell injury) and fecal calprotectin (a marker of gut inflammation) as well as CD4+ T-cell counts self reported stool quality (using the Bristol Stool Scale) safety and tolerability of the VSL#3 probiotic and level of stress.

HIV,Evaluating Demand Generation (Stylish Man  Stylshs Living) for HIV Prevention/Family Planning Services Rakai Uganda," The study will test a novel demand generation strategy ""Stylish Man/Stylish Living"" to increase uptake of Combined HIV Prevention (CHP) in Rakai Uganda. CHP includes evidence-based interventions including safe voluntary medical male circumcision (VMC) antiretroviral therapy (ART) prevention of mother to child transmission (p-MTCT) and behavioral interventions. With President's Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) funds the Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) provides CHP in Rakai District Uganda. Our ongoing 54 village Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) with community HIV prevalence ranging from 6% to 42% provides longitudinal data on rates of CHP coverage and on HIV incidence. The investigators have preliminary evidence that CHP is reducing HIV incidence in Rakai but coverage remains suboptimal (as elsewhere in Africa) particularly in men reducing program impact. Our data suggest that CHP supply is not the limiting factor but that there is a ""deficit in demand"". Based on extensive qualitative research the investigators have developed and piloted an innovative male-focused CHP demand generation strategy the ""Stylish Man/Stylish Living Program"" (SMLP) which is male-friendly without excluding exclude women. The SMLP strives to ""demedicalize"" CHP by deemphasizing health-focused messages and instead stressing ""taking charge of your life"". The SMP has two distinct but related elements: (1) mass media (MM) via radio and posters; and (2) community-level mobilization via the ""Stylish Man/Stylish Living Event"" (SMLEvent) which includes multimedia media (the Stylish Van videos music health promoters) into which the investigators have embedded CHP promotion and immediate access to services. In this study the investigators will conduct a 3 year cluster randomized trial of MM plus SMLEvents (intervention arm) compared to MM alone (control) in 25 RCCS communities per arm aggregated into ~10 clusters per arm (50 communities in all). The primary outcome will be intent-to-treat community-level rates of CHP coverage by arm. The investigators will also monitor rates of key behaviors and HIV incidence and compare them between arms and to rates observed in communities in each arm prior to study initiation (secondary outcomes).

HIV,SSAT063- Pharmacokinetics of Efavirenz 400 mg Once Daily During Pregnancy in HIV-1 Infected Women, The purpose of the study is to measure the drug levels in your blood and to find out whether a reduced dose (400mg) of the anti-HIV medication Efavirenz is safe when taken during pregnancy. The study will recruit HIV infected women who take Efavirenz as part of their anti-hiv treatment and who are pregnant. Efavirenz has been shown to be safe in pregnancy and at the standard dose that everybody takes of 600mg once a day it shows levels that are enough to treat HIV and give birth to a HIV negative baby. Efavirenz at a dose of 400mg once daily works against HIV too but this dose has not been given to HIV positive pregnant women. People with HIV may benefit from using a dose of efavirenz of 400mg instead of 600mg as lower drug doses could have fewer side effects and be tolerated better. Dose reduction would also make the drug cheaper. This would allow more people to be treated and free up money for other important work in the fight against HIV such as education and prevention programs. However it is not known whether 400mg of Efavirenz works as well as 600mg of Efavirenz during pregnancy and this is why the investigators are conducting this study which aims to measure the amount of Efavirenz 400mg in HIV pregnant women's bodies when they are taking 400mg of Efavirenz once a day.    ,NCT02499874
HIV,Dolutegravir Impact on Residual Replication, Several studies have suggested that despite suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people who are HIV-positive in some individuals there may be on-going viral replication. Clarifying the extent of on-going viral replication on ART is important for the development of HIV-1 curative strategies and for reducing HIV-1 associated immune activation. The investigators hypothesize that treatment intensification with dolutegravir will inhibit residual virus replication in HIV-1 infected patients on ART. The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of dolutegravir intensification on residual virus replication in circulating cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T cells.    ,NCT02500446

HIV,SSAT064: Pharmacokinetics of Abacavir/Lamivudine/Dolutegravir in HIV Patients of 60 Years and Over, The purpose of this study is to identify the effects that ageing may have on the drug levels the safety and the efficacy of Dolutegravir. These effects will be measured in people who are aged 60 or over and taking antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection. Dolutegravir is a newly licenced anti HIV medication which belongs to a class of drugs called Integrase Inhibitors. It is taken with two other wellknown agents Abacavir and Lamivudine as part of a one tablet once a day regimen called Triumeq. There is little data available on Dolutegravir in the context of older age. The HIV population is ageing and the investigators know that older age can significantly change the effects and side effects of medications including that of antiretrovirals. The investigators aim to investigate the treatment outcomes in older people taking Dolutegravir including the tolerability efficacy and safety of the drug. The study will also assess the quality of life (wellbeing of individuals) and cognition (mental abilities) of people aged 60 or over taking Dolutegravir. The results from this study may inform treatment choices and monitoring in this population in the future.

HIV,Pharmacogenomics of New Antiretrovirals, Some genetic polymorphisms are known to interfere with ARV metabolism and are therefore likely to explain some of the inter-individual variations (efficacytoxicityresistance) observed during ART. The most common form of human DNA variations consists of a change of a base in the nucleotide sequence of an individual at a given position the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Thereforethe purpose of this research will be the identification and characterization of the clinical impact of several SNPs in gene coding for transport proteins (e.g.ABCB1ABCC1) and biotransformation enzymes (e.g.CYP3A4CYP2B6) known to be involved in the pharmacokinetic pathway of selected ARV drugs for which the therapeutic response is difficult to predict. Asidethe influence of these SNPs on the response to treatment (CD4+cellviral load) and on the toxicity will be evaluated. Plasma concentrations of ARV drugs correlate with therapeutic efficacy but also with the risk of toxicity and of virological failure which is the basis of the therapeutic drug monitoring. Howevergiven the intracellular location of HIV analyzing intracellular drug concentrations is fundamental and the investigators will also focus of this new topic.    ,NCT02514369

HIV,Efficacy of ART to Interrupt HIV Transmission Networks, The investigators are conducting a study to learn more about the spread of HIV infection within different geographic regions and populations in San Diego County with the goal of demonstrating that early use of HIV treatment can reduce the number of new infections in our community. At the study visits participants will be examined by the study staff and asked to donate some blood. Participants will also be asked several questions about themselves their background behaviors health and the general geographic area in which they live. By collecting information about antiretroviral treatment choices that are made by study participants the investigators will be better able to measure how effectively HIV treatment can interrupt (i.e. block) the spread of HIV. All of the information gathered at the study visits will be de-identified and analyzed. Study staff will use the information to better understand in which groups of people and in what areas of San Diego HIV is spreading most quickly. This information will be used to determine how well Antiretroviral Therapy (HIV treatment) by certain individuals can control the spread of HIV within the population.    ,NCT02528773

HIV,Evaluation of South Africa's National Adherence Strategy," The South Africa National Department of Health (NDOH) intends to launch its newly developed National Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases (HIV TB and NCDs) throughout South Africa in the coming year. Early implementation of the ""minimum package"" of interventions described in the Adherence Guidelines for HIV patients will take place at 12 primary health clinics and community health centres in four provinces starting in July 2015. To maximize the learning potential of this early implementation stage NDOH will match the intervention clinics with 12 comparison clinics and randomly allocate intervention or comparison status within the pairs of clinics. This will allow the outcomes of the interventions to be evaluated using a cluster-randomized design and generate data on the costs of implementation and the potential need for adherence support for the other diseases addressed in the guidelines (tuberculosis hypertension and diabetes). This protocol is for the evaluation which will generate information on the effectiveness of minimum package interventions and help improve the design implementation and budgeting of the guidelines. The study will assess the effectiveness of five interventions in the minimum package: 1) Fast track initiation counseling for patients eligible for antiretroviral therapy; 2) Enhanced adherence counseling for unstable patients on HIV treatment; 3) adherence clubs for stable patients on HIV treatment; 4) decentralized medication delivery for stable patients on HIV treatment; and 5) early tracing of all patients who miss an appointment by two weeks. This study will also estimate for each study site an overall ""adherence guideline impact"" to provide an indication of the effectiveness of the package as a whole. In addition the study will estimate the cost of each of the interventions listed above compared to standard of care. Finally the study will describe the cascade of care for tuberculosis hypertension and diabetes three other chronic diseases for which little information currently exists. To evaluate these interventions the study team will work with the National Department of Health (which will implement the interventions) to randomize 24 clinics in 4 provinces 1:1 to receive the interventions or continue standard of care. All evaluations will use data routinely collected by the clinics with no study interaction with subjects. A total of 6680 patients will be enrolled and followed for up to 20 months to estimate short- and long-term outcomes.    ",NCT02536768

HIV,The Role of Multivitamins in Pediatric HIV Management in Nigeria, Micronutrient deficiencies in people living with HIV have been reported. Multivitamins can address micronutrient deficiencies however the benefits of multivitamins in people living with HIV is still debatable. While some multivitamin intervention studies have reported the benefits of multivitamins in HIV infection some other studies have reported no statistical differences in outcomes of interest in intervention and control groups. With clear differences in composition and strength of the multivitamins used in the different studies it is possible that some of the multivitamins used in some of the intervention studies may have been unable to meet existing micronutrient deficiencies. Hence there is a chance that higher strength multivitamins may be better able to correct these deficiencies and result in better outcomes. This study will therefore compare three different multivitamins varying in strength and composition to determine if any one of the three multivitamins will produce better health outcomes.    ,NCT02552602

HIV,A Clinical Trial of SystemCHANGE to Improve Exercise Diet and Health in HIV-Infected Adults, HIV was once a fatal diagnosis but due to treatment advances it is no longer a death sentence. Today HIV-infected adults face a new challenge to their health; they are developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) earlier and more frequently than those not HIV-infected. Reasons for this include toxic effects of HIV medications and activation of the immune system. Preventing cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected adults will help them live healthier lives; however there is a lack evidence to help us to achieve this goal. Exercise prevents cardiovascular disease but it is often not addressed in HIV care due in part to a lack of practical interventions targeting this population. This study will address this problem by testing an intervention to improve and maintain exercise in HIV-infected adults. This study will examine the impact of an innovative and sustainable intervention adapted to the unique medical and psychosocial needs of HIV-infected adults called SystemCHANGE-HIV. It consists of six sessions to help redesign an individual's environment and routines to increase exercise.This is a randomized trial in which half of the subjects will participate in the intervention and half will participate in a control condition. Measures include assessments of exercise fitness and the markers of cardiovascular health before and after the intervention to see if and how they changed.    ,NCT02553291
HIV,Clinical Phenotyping and Genotyping of HIV-Associated Sensory Neuropathy: The HIV-POGO Study, HIV associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is a frequent complication of HIV infection affecting between 20 and 57% of infected individuals. The advent of better antiretroviral treatment for HIV has meant that mortality from HIV has decreased dramatically in the UK. This means however that chronic age-related conditions associated with HIV such as HIV-SN and cognitive impairment are increasing in prevalence and becoming a significant disease burden. The classification diagnosis and treatment of HIV-SN remains poor. Currently little is known about the genetic basis of the disorder and what risk factors mean that some patients with HIV develop neuropathy and pain whilst others do not. It is hoped that by further characterising or 'phenotyping' the disorder it will be easier to identify which patients are at risk of developing neuropathy and chronic pain. It may also mean that treatment can be more individualised as currently patients often undergo a frustrating 'trial and error' protocol of treatment as clinicians can not yet predict who will respond to which treatment. It has also been suggested that there is a link between HIV-SN and HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) which is another common age-related complication of HIV infection. It may be that the existence of one pathology could predict the development of the other or that the presence of HAND may impair the diagnosis or treatment of chronic pain associated with HIV-SN. This study aims to recruit a cohort of HIV patients with and without HIV-SN and to identify genetic risk factors for the development of HIV-SN and neuropathic pain. It also aims to more deeply phenotype the condition using well validated questionnaires and to identify any influence that early neurocognitive dysfunction may have on the reporting diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain in the HIV population.    ,NCT02555930
HIV,Safety and Efficacy of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide as Part of Salvage Antiretroviral Regimens in Patients With Uncontrolled Viremia and Drug-Resistant HIV Infection, Background: HIV attacks the immune system. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a combination of drugs used for treating HIV infection. For some people ART drugs stop working against their HIV. Researchers want to see if a different form of the drug tenofovir (an ART drug currently approved by the FDA) combined with another drug may help people whose HIV is resistant to ART. This combination pill is called F/TAF Objective: To study the safety and efficacy of the drug F/TAF when used with other ART for people whose HIV infection has been hard to control with available medicines. Eligibility: People age 14 years and older who have HIV infection and are enrolled in the DOTCOM (14-I-0009) protocol. Design: Participants will be screened with physical exam medical history and blood and urine tests. Participants will stay in the hospital for at least 10 days. For the first 9 days they will take F/TAF by mouth along with their usual ART drugs. In the hospital they will repeat the screening tests. Participants will have a DEXA scan an x-ray that measures calcium and other minerals in the bones. Participants will lie on a soft table while the scanner passes over the lower spine and hips. Participants will get a supply of F/TAF and some new ART drugs to take at home. Participants will have follow-up visits in 1 2 4 8 and 12 weeks. After the 12-week visit they will come back about every 3 months for about 1 year. At these visits participants will repeat the screening tests. They will discuss any problems taking their ART drugs. They may have another DEXA scan.    ,NCT02556333
HIV,CHWs mHealth and Combination HIV Prevention," Kasensero a fishing community on Lake Victoria in Uganda is a representative HIV ""hotspot"" with extremely high HIV prevalence (44.3%) and incidence (~3.9/100py) yet low HIV service utilization. Hotspots such as Kasensero may seed and sustain HIV in general populations compromising national and regional HIV control efforts. PEPFAR UNAIDS and WHO have recognized the urgent need to target hotspots with enhanced HIV treatment and prevention efforts. However evidence on low-cost comprehensive and effective HIV control strategies for hotspots is limited and is thus a priority need for the field. The investigators propose an implementation science cluster-randomized controlled trial in Kasensero to evaluate the impact on HIV service uptake and HIV incidence of CHWs promoting combination HIV prevention (CHP) services supported by mobile health technologies (mHealth). CHP is the implementation of multiple evidence-based HIV prevention services (HIV testing and counseling antiretroviral therapy medical male circumcision and behavior change) to maximize population-level impact on HIV incidence. For CHP to substantively decrease HIV incidence most community members must be assessed for risk factors and current CHP utilization then triaged motivated linked and if HIV-infected retained in care. The proposed intervention will use low-cost CHWs leveraging mHealth decision support and counseling tools to promote CHP along this entire continuum of HIV service utilization. The hypotheses for this implementation science research are that residents in clusters receiving the implementation intervention will have improved CHP service uptake and decreased Population Prevalence of Viremia (PPDV) compared to controls receiving standard of care. The intervention will be evaluated through a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial nested within a large ongoing population-based cohort study of HIV the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS). Intervention arm participants will be visited in their place of residence by CHWs trained to evaluate and triage participants into risk categories provide tailored CHP health counseling linkage and adherence support all supported by a mHealth decision support tool. The primary outcomes will be CHP service coverage and PPDV. Other outcomes will be HIV incidence population viral load implementation measures retention virologic suppression and sexual behaviors. Complimentary mixed methods (quantitative qualitative and cost) evaluations of the trial will be conducted to evaluate implementation processes facilitators and barriers to inform study results and future program uptake. Focus groups and in-depth interviews will be conducted during and after the follow-up period and synthesized with quantitative data. Intervention costs will be prospectively measured to provide information on program affordability. Through this study a novel low-cost and scalable implementation intervention to improve CHP uptake will be evaluated in an HIV ""hotspot"" critical to controlling the HIV epidemic. The study design ensures rigorous evidence of immediate relevance to many stakeholders.    ",NCT02556957

HIV,Men Together Making a Difference: Health Promotion for Black Men, African American men infected with HIV are living longer and are acquiring the same chronic non-communicable diseases affecting the general population of African American men age 40 years and older. African American men have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes kidney disease and cancer particularly prostate and colon cancer but HIV is associated with an increased risk for co-morbidity from these conditions a risk heightened by not only HIV infection itself but also its treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The risk for many of these chronic diseases is tied to behavior: risk is increased by physical inactivity and unhealthful diet. Although the high risk for behavior-linked chronic diseases among HIV-positive individuals has been recognized there is a lack of evidence-based interventions specifically tailored to their needs. Hence the broad objective of this research is to identify strategies to empower HIV positive African American men to engage in behaviors that reduce their risk of chronic diseases. This research will test the efficacy of a theory-based contextually appropriate health promotion intervention in inducing positive changes in behaviors linked to risk of chronic diseases among HIV positive African American men age 40 years or older and will identify the theoretical variables that mediate its efficacy. In a randomized controlled trial African American HIV positive men age 40 or older who are receiving ART for HIV will be randomized to the Men Together Making a Difference Health Promotion Intervention which consists of three 3-hour weekly intervention sessions or the 1 session Health Awareness Control Group. The Men Together Making a Difference Health Promotion Intervention is based on social cognitive theory and the reasoned action approach integrated with formative research. Data will be collected at baseline immediately post and 3 6 and 12 months post intervention. The trial will test whether the Men Making a Difference Health Promotion Intervention increases self-reported physical activity compared with the Health Awareness Control Group.    ,NCT02572414
HIV,Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis and Timed Intercourse for HIV-Discordant Couples, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has now become a treatable disease and many infected individuals are interested in having a family. Couples in which the man is infected but the woman is HIV-negative (hereafter referred to as HIV-discordant) require medical intervention during procreation to prevent HIV transmission to the female and her child. The current view is that reducing the number of infections involving unprotected intercourse in HIV-discordant couples is a public health issue in the U.S. The safest methods for HIV-discordant couples are insemination using a sperm donor adoption and remaining childless. However some couples strongly desire a biologically related child. Fertility clinics in the United States have been resistant to treating HIV-discordant couples offering only expensive invasive techniques. This reduces access to care leading to couples choosing unprotected intercourse to conceive a child. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a treatment taken by the woman before having unprotected intercourse with an infected man. Truvada has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce the risk of HIV-discordant couples and the Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) has recommended that serodiscordant patients who wish to have a child be counseled on the availability of PrEP. When risks of transmission are minimized including undetectable HIV in blood and use of PrEP unprotected intercourse during the fertile period is likely to be a safe option for conceiving a child. The investigators propose to enroll HIV-discordant couples who have been counseled on the safer alternatives of donor insemination adoption and remaining childless; have been offered referral to a clinic offering sperm washing with insemination or in vitro fertilization (IVF); have been apprised of the risks of using PrEP and one timed intercourse per cycle; and decide to proceed with this method. Couples will be from the population of HIV-discordant patients with a minimal risk of disease transmission as described above. After evaluation for normal fertility and low potential for disease transmission the couple will receive instruction on timing of the most fertile day of the cycle and the woman will be given a prescription for the PrEP medication. The woman and any offspring will be followed for 6 months using blood tests to check for evidence of HIV infection.    ,NCT02572505

HIV,Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of MONotherapy of TiviCAY® Versus a Triple Therapy in HIV-1-infected Patients," Triple antiretroviral regimens have greatly improved the prognosis of patients living with HIV (PLHIV). Patients virologically controlled and having a good immune restoration can have a life expectancy close or equal to that of people not infected with HIV.[1] However this is under the condition of a ""lifetime"" maintenance of an undetectable plasma viral load (pVL) (<50 cp/ml). On the other hand it is well established that aging increases comorbidities among PLHIV and the burden of co-medications.[2] This also has the consequence of frequent drug-drug interactions. In this context it is important to decrease pills burden side-effects and drug-drug interactions while maintaining undetectability. Currently there is a strong interest for medical research to validate lightened regimens (i.e. bithérapies [3-7] and monothérapies [89] particularly in a maintenance strategy with the primary objective of reducing burden of pills and side effects. Several monotherapy trials using a boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) showed high level of viral suppression even if this proportion was not always non-inferior to maintaining a triple therapy. [89] Fortunately when virological failure occurred under monotherapy virologic suppression was easily restored by the addition of two NRTI. Patients who are most likely to maintain viral suppression under a reduced scheme are those that have a high nadir (> 100 CD4 / mm3) no previous AIDS event and a sustained virologic suppression (>12 months). Monotherapy is the option that best reduces the burden of pills and the risk of side effects or drug-drug interactions. It must be considered using very powerful molecule that harbor a strong binding to its ligand in order to minimize the risk of selecting resistant mutants in the case of virologic failure. To be as simple as possible in its use it must be a single agent administered as a single dose once a day and not boosted if possible. The molecule must have very good tolerance. Finally to be effective in viral sanctuaries this molecule should have a good (or sufficient) diffusion to ensure effective Cmin on wild viral strains. Dolutegravir meets all these exigences.[10] In addition our team recently presented results of a pilot study showing that the switch of a successful combined antiretroviral regimen to dolutegravir monotherapy maintained undetectable viral load (<20 cp/ml) after a median of 7 months (range 6.5-10 months).

HIV,Effects of the Anti-HIV Pill Truvada on Gene Transcription in the Gastrointestinal Tract of HIV-uninfected Individuals, As explained in detail in a recently published hypothesis article (Hladik F. A new hypothesis on HIV cure. F1000Research 4:77 (2015)) the investigators hypothesize that NRTI drugs may reduce the likelihood of HIV eradication by promoting the survival of cells with integrated provirus. In this study the investigators will test whether daily oral use of two NTRI drugs tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada Pill) induces changes in the upper and lower gut mucosa that are congruent with supporting this hypothesis.    ,NCT02621242
HIV,Health Improvement for Baltimore Youth, Preliminary data from the investigators' NCCAM-funded R21 on mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in HIV-infected youth suggest an association between mindfulness and improved self-regulation and medication adherence.

HIV,Effects of Mindfulness Training on Chronic Inflammation in HIV-Infected Adults, By 2015 half of the people living with HIV infection in the U.S. are estimated be over the age of 50 and this cohort of patients with well-controlled plasma viremia is aging at a more rapid pace than their non-HIV peers. Long-term chronic inflammation plays a critical role in premature aging in HIV-infected adults. Markers associated with chronic inflammation including IL-6 CRP sCD14 and d-dimer have not only been shown to be present at higher levels in HIV-infected adults but are also correlated to a wide variety of morbidities and mortality. The goal of this project is to determine the impact of two different interventions -- Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Health Enhancement Program (HEP) -- on reducing biological markers associated with chronic inflammation in HIV-infected adults with an undetectable HIV viral load. In order to achieve this goal a pilot RCT with 120 subjects over 50 years old who are on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) will be conducted with the following specific aims: 1) to assess the effect of MBSR and/or HEP on biomarkers of chronic inflammation (IL-6 CRP sCD14 d-dimer) and 2) to explore whether changes in psychological well-being (anxiety depression fatigue cognitive functioning) mediate the impact on chronic inflammation. Subjects will be randomized to participation in a group MBSR course or to the HEP group both of which consist of 8 weekly sessions followed by 6 monthly booster sessions. Three time points will be measured: baseline 8 weeks (immediately after completion of weekly intervention) and 6-months post-completion of weekly intervention. Mixed linear and structural equation model will be used to test the study hypotheses. The proposed study is innovative in that it is the first to explore the impact of a complementary mind-body intervention on chronic inflammation in HIV-infected adults. Given that the consequences of early aging in this cohort will be a burden on the health care system as well as a medical social and psychological burden on those living with HIV the study has the potential to have a major public health impact.    ,NCT02626949
HIV,Comprehensive Analysis of HIV Reservoirs in Chronically Infected HIV-1 Treated Patients," HIV infection can be efficiently controlled by antiretroviral therapy (ART) with in 2013 nearly 85 % of patients having a suppressed viremia but HIV cannot however be eradicated with ART alone [1]. Overall HIV has moved from a fatal to a chronic disease provided treatment is maintained life-long. Despite major improvement in antiretroviral drugs in terms of efficacy tolerability and simplicity life-long therapy is still associated with drug toxicity. Several drugs or drug classes which have historically saved lives since 1996 and are currently widely used such as protease inhibitors and nucleosides analogues are associated with long-term toxicities and increased incidence of comorbidities. Currently worldwide there is an approximated 10 millions of HIV infected patients under cART. This number should increase in the next years as most recent guidelines recommend earlier therapy given the benefits in terms of disease progression and prevention of transmission. Because of the increasing number of patients who will be under cART in the future the cumulative ART toxicity the difficulties to access ART in some areas of the world the fatigue expressed by patients about ART and the cost issues there is an urgent need to search for HIV CURE. To date only two cases of sterilizing HIV cure were reported so far: the famous ""Berlin Patient"" after two homozygous Delta32-CCR5 bone-marrow grafts for an acute leukemia [2] and the Mississipi baby after very early initiation of cART 31 hours after delivery [3]. However those cases of sterilizing HIV cure remain exceptional and the alternative objective of a functional HIV cure appears to be more realistic though still described in rare groups of patients like Elite controllers (EC) and post treatment controllers (PTC) patients. In addition new and complex therapeutic strategies are currently proposed to try purging the HIV reservoirs but none of them proved so far able to reach this goal. Therefore the objective of finding a Cure to HIV [4] requires first to better understand the basic mechanisms of the persistence of HIV reservoirs in the population of chronically-infected fully-suppressed HIV+ patients in order to define future therapeutic strategies.

HIV,Early Infant Diagnosis Point of Care Pilot, In Mozambique early infant HIV diagnosis (EID i.e. HIV screening of infants under 18 months of age) is conducted using molecular diagnostics at central laboratories in Maputo Nampula Beira and Quelimane. However test volumes are growing and many parts of the country do not have close access to laboratories. Test samples are transported over large distances and this can introduce testing delays especially for patients in rural and remote areas of the country. There are now new POC EID technologies becoming available that will enable diagnosis of HIV in infants within minutes or a couple of hours on site in the clinic operated by non technical staff and without laboratory infrastructure. This protocol describes a plan to conduct an evaluation of a Point-Of-Care (POC) Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) testing technologies that are being considered for use in Mozambique and to pilot those technologies in order to provide more effective diagnostics and clinical care to patients. During this implementation pilot sites are randomized to use either conventional or POC EID testing only before the inclusion of the patients in the study. No consent will be asked to the parents or guardians. A written permission will be asked to the Direção Provincial de Saúde of both provinces to implement the POC device as routine in those intervention sites. All the information that will be analyzed will be collected from the routine care and it will be analyzed as a group.    ,NCT02634450
HIV,Antiretroviral Localization in Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue and Lower Female Genital Tract Tissue of HIV+ Subjects, The purpose of this research study is to find out how the drugs Truvada® (tenofovir/emtricitabine) Isentress® (raltegravir) Reyataz® (atazanavir) Sustiva® (efavirenz) and Selzentry® (maraviroc) get into the intestines and the female genital tract. All of these drugs are very effective at reducing the number of HIV viruses in the blood however it is unknown how the drugs move around inside tissues where HIV might be hiding. This study will determine specifically where in the tissue the drug and the HIV are located through the use of a new technology that takes creates a picture of the tissue. This information will help scientists determine the best way to make new drugs to target the hidden HIV in tissue.    ,NCT02641444
HIV,HIV Sequencing After Treatment Interruption to Identify the Clinically Relevant Anatomical Reservoir, The main goal of this study is to identify and characterise the anatomical component of the replication competent HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1) reservoir. The investigators hypothesize that the clinically relevant HIV-1 reservoir is hiding in various but specific anatomic compartments and is able to rebound when therapy is stopped. This reservoir is probably smaller than the HIV-1 reservoir hiding in the blood but could be more transcriptional active because of its specific environment possibly influenced by lower concentrations of the antiretroviral therapy. The current proposal will for the first time identify the source of the viral reservoir by phylogenetically backtracking the viral genome of the rebounding virus to the sequences of viral DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) in different anatomical compartments. The subsequent characterization of the viral reservoir markers (size integration sites methylation profile stimulation and inhibition assays) will enable us to understand how this viral rebound occurred.    ,NCT02641756

HIV,Cognitive Training With and Without tDCS to Improve Cognition in HIV, The purpose of this study is to develop pilot data on the potential efficacy of computer-based cognitive training or the combination of computer-based cognitive training with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in improving cognitive function in persons with HIV-related mild neurocognitive disorder (MND). tDCS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique in which a small direct current (1-2 mA) is applied to the scalp during a cognitive or motor activity inducing a very small current that affects specific neural circuits related to the site at which electrodes are placed. tDCS has been judged safe and has shown significant treatment effects in studies with other populations but has not been extensively studied in individuals with HIV infection. tDCS has been shown to facilitate learning in a number of studies suggesting that it may improve or enhance learning in those with cognitive problems. As HIV infection is associated with decrements in a number of cognitive skills including working memory executive functions and psychomotor speed that are related to individuals' functional status and medication adherence the demonstration of a technique to enhance the effects of cognitive training in this population would have substantial clinical benefits as well as scientific value.    ,NCT02647645

HIV,Scaling up TB and HIV Treatment Integration, This study addresses the highest ranking health research priority in South Africa which is to develop and test optimal models of HIV-TB service delivery that will enhance retention adherence and coverage of HIV-TB co-infected patients. HIV and TB are highest in sub-Saharan Africa a region with limited health budgets infrastructure human resources and suboptimal TB infection control practices. There is compelling clinical evidence suggesting that integrating HIV and TB services saves lives and presents an effective and efficient use of resources directed at optimizing health outcomes. Quality improvement (QI) methods are increasingly being used to systematically test and incorporate local ideas into strategies for reliable implementation and scale up. This trial is designed to test a practical implementable and affordable strategy aimed at improving HIV-TB service integration to reduce TB and HIV associated deaths. This is a cluster randomized controlled trial which evaluates and tests the effectiveness of implementing a QI model to integrate HIV-TB service delivery in primary health care clinics on reducing morbidity and mortality in TB-HIV co-infected patients. This study will be conducted in 2 districts Ugu and uThungulu in KwaZulu-Natal South Africa. The model of integrated care delivery for TB and HIV using the QI method offers a systems approach to care delivery to directly enhance treatment outcomes by enabling comprehensive effective care designed around the patients journey from entry to the clinic through screening treatment initiation treatment completion and retention in care that is directed at the goals of cure for TB effective sustainable HIV viral suppression and reduced HIV associated TB mortality as the main health impact. The scalability of the model once proven effective is the critical element that makes it increase population coverage of quality diagnosis and treatment of HIV-TB co-infection. QI methods promote front line staff engagement in identification and rapid testing of local implementation solutions to gaps in performance of processes of care along the steps of the patient journey. Gaps in care are identified through continuous feedback on a core set of indicators collected monthly as routine collection of data.    ,NCT02654613

HIV,Etiology of Treatment Failure in HIV Positive Children and Adolescents on Boosted Protease Inhibitor-based Regimens, Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) transformed a once fatal condition into a chronic manageable condition. However it is estimated that 20-40% of patients on 2nd line treatment (2 nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] and a boosted protease inhibitor [PI]) are failing treatment. Figures are thought to be higher in children and adolescents. The reason why patients are failing 2nd line treatment is not exactly known. Failure has been previously attributed to poor adherence. However some literature shows that some patients on boosted PIs achieve and maintain viral suppression despite suboptimal adherence (adherence of 80- 95%). Viral factors like drug resistance are also implicated in treatment failure. However boosted PIs have high genetic barrier to clinically significant mutations. Therefore a virus would have to harbour multiple PI mutations for the virus to have reduced susceptibility to boosted PI regimens. Pharmacological factors such as suboptimal dosing impaired absorption and drug interactions may also be responsible for treatment failure. If sub-optimal adherence is the reason why children are failing 2nd line treatment then restoring optimal adherence should result in viral suppression failure of which might mean that other causes are contributing to failure. If resistance is the cause of treatment failure then this study will provide evidence for advocating for resistance testing and the use of 3rd line antiretroviral drugs. If children with adequate adherence demonstrate inadequate drug levels in their plasma then this study will provide evidence to advocate for studies to examine reasons for inadequate drug exposure amongst HIV-infected children. These studies are paramount to optimizing dosing algorithms in this population. This proposed study will help elucidate reasons for treatment failure in HIV-infected children on second line treatment with the aim of ultimately optimizing antiretroviral treatment strategies for this important group.    ,NCT02689895
HIV,Protease Inhibitor vs. Raltegravir-based ART and Inflammation in HIV Infection, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection damages body defence mainly by affecting two important white blood cells called cluster of differentiation (CD4) T cells and monocytes. This immune dysfunction leads to persistent inflammation which is partially resolved with long-term anti-HIV therapy. Importantly such inflammation increases risk for cardiovascular diabetes and kidney diseases. The causes of this inflammation are largely unknown and include HIV itself presence of other infections lifestyle characteristics like increased cholesterol levels obesity smoking and alcohol abuse. In addition inflammation can be driven by certain type of anti-HIV therapy called protease inhibitor (PI). PI has been associated with an increase of cholesterol and may contribute to inflammation. A new class of medication that is now available in Canada called integrase inhibitor (II) may have a lesser or no effect on cholesterol levels. Therefore it is important to study the effect of II on cholesterol levels and inflammation. The purpose of this study is to assess the inflammatory changes in the blood of persons treated with PI that will switch to the II or may remain on their PI-containing regimen. By comparing persons continuing their current PI-based regimen with those who switch to II-based regimen we will know if the change from PI to raltegravir (Isentress) a type of II decreases lipids and inflammatory markers. The adult persons living with HIV who are on PI-based therapy for more than a year with any CD4 T cell count and plasma viral load below level of detection will be invited to participate in the study. 40 study participants will be selected by randomization (like a toss of a coin) to either continue PI-based regimen (20 participants) or switch to raltegravir-based regimen (20 participants) for a period of 12 months. Blood samples of the study participants will be drawn before during and at the end of study to evaluate changes in markers of inflammation cholesterol level and CD4 T cell and monocyte function. No experimental anti-HIV medication will be used; change of therapy will include raltegravir which is one of currently recommended medications to treat HIV in Canada. This study will be able to answer this important question whether inflammation can be decreased by switching therapy from PI-based therapy to raltegravir-based therapy. Ultimately information provided by this study will contribute to the health of persons living with HIV.    ,NCT02691065

HIV,Clinical and Virological Outcome of European Patients Infected With HIV, The EuroSIDA study is a prospective observational cohort study of 20000+ patients followed in 100+ clinics in 35 European countries Israel and Argentina. The study is the largest pan-European cohort study and few studies of a comparable design are available on a global scale. The EuroSIDA study is an ongoing collaboration and patients have been enrolled into the study through 10 cohorts since 1994. The main objective of the study remains the same as in1994: to prospectively study clinical therapeutic demographic virological and laboratory data from HIV-1 positive persons across Europe in order to determine their long-term virological immunological and clinical outcomes. Historically EuroSIDA has been crucial in reporting key changes in the HIV epidemic such as the dramatic changes in morbidity and mortality when combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) was first introduced. As new anti-HCV treatment is introduced to HIV/HCV co-infected patients it is important for EuroSIDA to remain in the forefront of investigating the treatment benefits and adverse effects. All study documents study status newsletters scientific publications and presentations are available online and are updated continuously at project website. In general terms the objective of the EuroSIDA study is to continue a long-term prospective collection of clinical laboratory and therapeutic data as well as plasma on a large cohort of consecutive HIV infected patients from across Europe in order to (1) assess the factors associated with the clinical immunological and virological course of HIV infection and HIV-related co-infections and co-morbidities and (2) continue to provide and develop a surveillance system to describe temporal changes and regional differences in the clinical course of HIV and HIV-related co-infections and co-morbidities in Europe.    ,NCT02699736

HIV,The Impact of Home Delivery of Antiretroviral Therapy on Virological Suppression, Home delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) by community health workers (CHWs) has the potential to reduce key barriers to ART care retention. The primary endpoint of this trial is the effect of CHW-led home delivery of ART on the proportion of patients with a suppressed HIV viral load after six months follow-up. This is a cluster-randomized controlled trial set in Dar es Salaam's Temeke district. The unit of randomization is a healthcare facility with its surrounding neighborhoods. We matched all 18 healthcare facilities offering ART services in Temeke district into pairs based on having a similar number of patients currently on ART. In each pair one cluster was randomized to the intervention and one to the control arm. The intervention consists of monthly home visits by CHWs to provide counseling and deliver ART to patients who are stable on ART while the control is the standard of care (facility-based ART care and CHW home visits at least every three months without ART home delivery). In addition within each study arm half of the healthcare facilities were randomized to enhanced CHW-led nutrition counseling and half to standard counseling.    ,NCT02711293

HIV,Testing for Tuberculosis in the United Kingdom HIV Infected Population, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the strongest individual risk factor for the reactivation of tuberculosis (TB) after previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb). This risk is reduced but not completely eliminated when HIV is treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both the British HIV Association (BHIVA) and National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggest testing for latent TB infection in HIV infected individuals but use different criteria. The cost -effectiveness of either approach has not been assessed nor is testing widespread. A certain proportion of HIV infected subjects in Africa have MTb detectable in their sputum despite not having symptoms (such as cough or weight loss) nor changes on a chest x ray. It is unclear if this happens in lower TB prevalence areas such as the United Kingdom (UK). We intend to test a cohort of HIV infected subjects for evidence of latent TB using a tuberculin skin test (TST) and Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) ask about symptoms (using a standardised questionnaire) and to induce sputum using a saline nebuliser to detect MTb using microscopy and culture and newer nucleic acid amplification (genetic) techniques. Some patients despite being exposed to TB in the past will not mount a response using an IGRA or TST which maybe due to an abnormal immune response. This lack of response seems more common in HIV. By investigating the number of patients with positive TST IGRA chest X ray and evidence of MTb in their sputum in the context of place of birth previous exposure to TB CD4 count and other medications we can assess the cost- effectiveness of systematic TB screening and the use anti-TB antibiotics to prevent reactivation of TB. In time we will be able to answer important questions about the time taken to reactivate TB in individuals with HIV who do or don't take preventative anti-TB medications in the UK.    ,NCT02712671

HIV,Effects of Eplerenone on Cardiovascular Disease in HIV (MIRACLE HIV Study), HIV-infected individuals treated with antiretroviral medications are living longer but have an increased risk of heart disease when compared to non-HIV-infected individuals. A hormone called aldosterone which regulates blood pressure and sodium balance is elevated in the HIV population in association with with increased belly fat and altered glucose metabolism. Elevations in aldosterone hormone may also be associated with abnormal blood flow inflammation and coronary plaque in the heart. This study is being conducted to evaluate whether therapies to reduce the actions of aldosterone may decrease the burden and progression of heart disease in the HIV population.    ,NCT02740179

HIV,Point of Care Early Infant Diagnosis Patient Impact Study, In Malawi early infant HIV diagnosis (EID i.e. HIV screening of infants under 18 months of age) is conducted using molecular diagnostics at central laboratories. However test volumes are growing and many parts of the country do not have close or easy access to laboratories. Test samples are transported over large distances and this can introduce testing delays especially for patients in rural and remote areas of the country. There are growing numbers of high quality Point-Of-Care (POC) diagnostic technologies available and there is increasing interest in using these technologies to alleviate critical testing needs. This protocol describes an observational study looking at the patient impact of implementing POC EID technologies within the routine standard of care at seven facilities.    ,NCT02744404

Prompts will be sent to patients to remind health care workers if they are due for repeat laboratory monitoring. The primary endpoint is linkage to care (a HIV-related laboratory test) at 6 months. The control group received standard of care.    ,NCT02756949
HIV,Speed of Processing Training in Adults With HIV," As people age with HIV the synergistic effects with normal age-related cognitive declines will accentuate and/or accelerate declines in cognitive functioning which can be detected as early in one's 40s. Although interventions are needed to protect/improve cognitive functioning one intervention already exists to improve speed of processing. NINR/NIA (January 14 2014) announced that Speed of Processing Training used in the ACTIVE Study (N = 2802 community-dwelling older adults) has the ability to enable ""older people to maintain their cognitive abilities as they age"" even 10 years after training. As shown in the ACTIVE Study this intervention uniquely improves driving instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) health-related quality of life self-rated health internal locus of control and protects one from depression; these represent areas of needed intervention for adults with HIV as well. In adults with HIV previous pilot studies likewise indicate speed of processing declines are associated with poorer driving simulator performance and more self-reported at-fault automobile crashes; such speed of processing declines on driving alone represent a significant public health concern. These studies also demonstrated that Speed of Processing Training improved this cognitive ability and translated into improved performance on a timed measure of IADLs. Based on prior research this RCT proposal consists of a pre-post two-year longitudinal experimental design whereby 264 adults with HIV 40+ years and diagnosed with HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder will be randomly assigned to one of three training conditions: 1) 10 hours of laboratory-based Speed of Processing Training 2) 20 hours of laboratory-based Speed of Processing Training or 3) 10 hours of a standardized computer-contact control (sham) condition. AIM 1: Determine whether 10 vs 20 hours of speed of processing training will improve this cognitive ability at post-test year 1 and year 2 after baseline. AIM 2: Determine whether 10 vs 20 hours of speed of processing training will improve everyday functioning at post-test year 1 and year 2 after baseline. Exploratory AIM: Determine whether improvement in speed in speed of processing and/or everyday functioning over time mediate improvement quality of life (e.g. depression health related quality of life).

HIV,An Observational Retrospective Database Analysis to Evaluate Raltegravir Based-regimens in Aged HIV Patients (RalAge)," RAL is considered one of the better-tolerated antiretroviral medications due to limited side effects and few long-term safety concerns. Five-year clinical trial outcomes and clinical experience have demonstrated durable virologic suppression in both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients including patients with extensive antiretroviral history and documented antiretroviral resistance. Studies have also exhibited low adverse effect rates and reliable long-term safety lending to improved tolerance. Several trials have evaluated the reduction in adverse effects in patients switched from various antiretroviral agents to RAL. Treatment-naïve studies have demonstrated a lipid-neutral effect in patients on RAL-containing regimens. When transitioning patients from a ritonavir-boosted PI regimen statistically significant decreases in total plasma cholesterol low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides were demonstrated. Given its negligible interaction with the cytochrome P450 system RAL displays minimal drug-drug interactions making it a good option for ageing patients on multiple medications. This is an observational retrospective cohort in real world to describe RAL data including NUC-sparing regimens in aged HIV patients. It is a phase IV study. 90 patients will be enrolled from the Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases of ""Sapienza"" University of Rome. More than 4000 HIV patients are followed at this Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases of ""Sapienza"" University of Rome. More than 50% of these patients are ??50 years. From 10 to 12% are treated with a raltegravir based- regimen. The primary endpoint will be the description of the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 viral load < 50 copies/mL. The secondary endpoints will be:   -  Change from Baseline in CD4+ T-cell counts CD8 cell counts CD4/ CD8 ratio   -  Proportion of subjects with laboratory alterations   -  Proportion of patients with adverse events (AE) serious adverse events (SAE) also according to their severity    ",NCT02765776

HIV,Resistance Testing to Improve Management of Virologic Failure in Sub-Saharan Africa, The study design is an open-label randomized controlled trial. The study will be conducted at study sites in Uganda and South Africa. The study population will include HIV-infected patients on first-line antiretroviral therapy with a recent viral load >1000 copies/milliliter (or dried blood spot viral load >1000 copies/milliliter). Eligible participants will be randomized to the WHO-based standard of care for management of virologic failure or immediate resistance testing to guide ART regimen decisions. The primary outcome of interest will be viral suppression (<200 copies/mL) at 9 months after study enrollment and will be assessed using an intention to treat analysis where missing or absent results will be considered failures. Secondary outcomes of interest will be viral suppression below the limit of assay detection viral suppression on continuation of first-line (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]-based) therapy drug resistance at study conclusion and mortality among others. The overarching goal of this study is to determine whether addition of routine resistance testing to guide management of virologic failure and sustain the successful completion of the HIV continuum of care improves clinical outcomes and reduces costs for patients with virologic failure on first-line therapy in sub-Saharan Africa.    ,NCT02787499
HIV,Vedolizumab (Anti-alpha4beta7) in Subjects With HIV Infection Undergoing Analytical Treatment Interruption, Background: In most people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) their immune system cannot control HIV infection. They need drugs called combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to control the HIV. When people stop cART treatment their immune system cannot control the infection again. They can also become resistant to cART and have lasting side effects. Researchers want to test if the drug vedolizumab is effective at controlling HIV infection without the need for cART. Objective: To teste if vedolizumab is safe and can control the amount of HIV in the blood when cART is not taken. Eligibility: People ages 18-65 who have HIV and are being treated with cART Design: Participants will be screened with: Physical exam Medical history Electrocardiogram: Soft sticky patches on the chest arms and legs measure heart activity. Blood and urine tests Participants will have a baseline visit. This will be 2-5 hours each day for 1-2 days. It will include repeats of the screening tests and: Leukapheresis: Blood is removed through a needle in the arm. A machine separates the white blood cells from the blood. The rest of the blood is returned to the participant. Neurologic exam: The nerves and reflexes are tested. First vedolizumab infusion through an arm vein Participants will have visits every 4 weeks for 30 weeks. These will include: Vedolizumab infusions Repeats of baseline tests Participants will have more visits for blood draws. Participants will keep taking cART until after the week 22 infusion. After discontinuing cART at study week 22 participants will be seen every two weeks to monitor the CD4 count and the level of HIV in the blood. Some of these visits will occur in between infusion visits and will only take about 1 hour to complete. cART will be restarted if a participant s HIV levels go up to high or if their CD4 cell counts decreases by too much. For the follow-up phase participants will have visits every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. These will include blood tests and a physical exam.    ,NCT02788175

HIV,Pharmacokinetics of Efavirenz in the Presence of Rifampicin and Isoniazid, The purpose of the study is to measure the drug levels in the blood of HIV-infected individuals taking anti- HIV medication efavirenz 400 mg once daily in the presence of anti-TB medication rifampicin and isoniazid. The study is being run in two-stages - London (Stage 1) and Kampala (Stage 2). In London (Stage 1): HIV-1 infected patients (without tuberculosis infection) on established treatment with a combination based on 600 mg efavirenz dose will be recruited. In Kampala (Stage 2): Patients with both HIV-1 and tuberculosis infection being treated with 600 mg efavirenz combination for HIV AND undergoing TB treatment with a dual therapy regimen contaning rifampicin and isoniazid will be recruited. Efavirenz-containing regimens are recommended as first-line therapy for HIV-TB co-infected patients. It has been shown there is a lack of a significant difference between efavirenz 400 mg and efavirenz 600 mg indicating that 400 mg efavirenz is non-inferior to the standard dose. The advantages of antiretroviral dose reductions may translate into greater benefits for more individuals infected by HIV globally since they may allow access programs to reach higher numbers of infected patients and compensate for the finite global manufacturing capacity and increasing demand. For efavirenz significant price reductions have been achieved through elimination of trade logistics and manufacturing capacity barriers and further price reductions could be achieved with a significant reduction in the cost of pharmaceutical ingredients. However no data on the PK and effectiveness of efavirenz 400 mg once daily during TB treatment has been produced. Given that many patients on Efavirenz- based ART will need to be treated for TB during their lifetime and rifampicin is one of the most commonly used treatment for tuberculosis it is important to study the reduced dose under carefully monitored conditions prior to roll out of a lower dose standard treatment. Therefore we aim to investigate the PK of efavirenz 400 mg once daily in HIV-infected individuals in the presence of rifampicin and isoniazid in London UK and in HIV/TB-co-infected individuals on dual anti-TB treatment in Kampala Uganda    ,NCT02832778

HIV,Tenofovir/Emtricitabine With Doxycycline for Combination HIV and Syphilis Pre-exposure Prophylaxis in HIV-negative MSM, Men who have sex with men remain at high risk for HIV infection. Targeting prevention interventions to MSM at highest risk of seroconversion is an important goal of combination prevention interventions. Antecedent diagnosis of another sexually transmitted infection (STI) particularly syphilis may serve as an entry point for biomedical prevention as these individuals are at highest risk for incident HIV. The use of the antiretroviral combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine has been shown to be associated with an overall 44% reduction in HIV acquisition in high-risk MSM when taken daily as PrEP. In those individuals with detectable drug levels the benefit was as high as 90% risk reduction. In real-world evaluations of PrEP high-risk sexual behaviour may continue as evidenced by high rates of intercurrent sexually transmitted infections. As such biomedical interventions that may offer additional reduction in acquisition of common sexually transmitted infections should also be evaluated. Recently a small pilot study has demonstrated potential benefit from a similar strategy for syphilis prevention. In this study 30 MSM were randomized to receive either 100mg doxycycline once daily or contingency management strategies linked to remaining free of sexually transmitted diseases at progressive study visits. Overall those receiving doxycycline were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with any STI during followup than those in the comparator arm. The investigators therefore propose to undertake a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of using both tenofovir/emtricitabine and doxycycline (immediate or deferred use) for pre-exposure prophylaxis amongst HIV-negative MSM with recent history of syphilis infection in Vancouver Canada.    ,NCT02844634

HIV,Kenya Enhanced Mentor Mother ProgrAm (EMMA), Kenya recently adopted new treatment guidelines for pregnant women with HIV which calls for all women to initiate triple-drug antiretroviral therapy (ART) at or soon after their first visit for antenatal care. As part of this new standard of care to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) Kenya also established the Kenya Mentor Mother Program (KMMP) in 2012 to provide guidance for standardizing peer education and psychosocial support services within the national PMTCT program. This new standard of care (life-long ART and the KMMP) will only yield significant improvements in preventing mother to child transmission if women accept the triple-drug treatment during pregnancy and adhere to visit schedules so that they receive uninterrupted supplies of their medications during pregnancy through at least the cessation of breastfeeding. The primary objectives of this study are: (1) to evaluate implementation of the new guidelines in Kenya under actual real-world conditions in major maternal and child health clinics in the southern Rift Valley region of Kenya; and (2) to evaluate also under routine program conditions the benefits of an innovative intervention package designed to improve implementation of the new treatment guidelines. The intervention uses the existing Mentor Mothers who already are part of the PMTCT program staff at clinics. At the end of each clinic visit the Mentor Mother will review with patients their treatment plan and schedule their next visit. The Mentor Mother will also offer at each encounter to send a text message reminder to the patient for their next clinic visit and offer to set up an automatic reminder directly on the patient's cell phone. The intervention strategy was developed in close collaboration with local health facility and PMTCT program staff based on their prior and on-going experience providing PMTCT services in the region and this strategy has the potential to dramatically improve PMTCT service delivery and support global goals to eliminate mother to child transmission. The study is taking place in 12 clinics in the south-rift valley region of Kenya. A total of 360 patients will be enrolled into the study (approximately 30 at each clinic). The investigators are enrolling patients to receive their permission to look at information recorded in their medical records. All patients eligible for the study who provide written consent will be included in the study until the target number of 360 is obtained. After consenting the study will have no further contact with patients. Because the study only reviews information in medical files that clinics already collect as part of routine care risks to patients are minimal. The only possible risk is the accidental disclosure of HIV status but the study is designed to minimize such a risk. There are no direct benefits to study participants as the study is designed to understand existing adherence to PMTCT care and treatment and to improve such adherence. The study is expected to start in 2016 and end in 2019.    ,NCT02848235
HIV,Does Micro-albuminuria is a Predictive Factor for Cognitive Impairment in Persons Living With HIV (PLHIV) Who Achieve cART-sustained Immunovirological Control ?, Chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequent in PLHIV is a risk factor for cognitive impairment. Micro-albuminuria is an early manifestation of CKD and a marker of vascular risk notably affecting the small vessels. In the older general population microalbuminuria is associated with greater annual cognitive decline and has been proposed as an easily and inexpensive measured marker predicting future cognitive function decline. Ageing of the PLH leads to an increase of cognitive disorders and chronic renal failure incidence and could imply a common underlying mechanism affecting the renal and cerebral microvasculature. In this setting the investigators undertake this prospective cross-sectional case-control study to determine whether the presence of a microalbuminuria at least 5 years ago in PLHs with sustained good combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-controlled immunovirological parameters could be a marker predicting future cognitive impairment. They chose PLHs infected for at least 5 years and with cART-sustained immunovirological control for at least 1 year.    ,NCT02852772

HIV,Expanded PrEP Implementation in Communities in NSW, A new NSW Ministry of Health HIV Strategy released on 1 December 2015 aims for the virtual elimination of HIV transmission in NSW by 2020. Critical to the new strategy's success is the population-based targeted roll-out of HIV PrEP. PrEP involves taking one pill daily of co-formulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/ emtricitabine (FTC). This large-scale study aims for the rapid roll-out of TDF/FTC to individuals at high risk of HIV who will comprise mostly gay and bisexual men (GBM) but will also include small numbers of heterosexuals injecting drug users and transgender men and women. The drug will be used according to existing NSW Ministry of Health Guidelines. By rapidly rolling out this new intervention over a 12 month period and following participants for two years on treatments a reduction of about 50% in new HIV diagnoses in NSW is expected. The study aims to assess the incidence of HIV among PrEP study participants and measure the population-level impact of the rapid roll-out of PrEP on HIV diagnoses among GBM in NSW over a two-year period. It will also evaluate the rate of PrEP uptake among high risk GBM in NSW assess the incidence of STI (gonorrhoea chlamydia and infectious syphilis) among people prescribed PrEP and measure the effect of the rapid roll-out of PrEP on the overall number of notifications of gonorrhoea chlamydia and infectious syphilis in NSW describe patterns of PrEP use and medication adherence and monitor behavioural risk practices among PrEP users. The main population group will be 3700 gay men at high risk of HIV infection. All procedures of this study are guided by the NSW Guidelines on PrEP.

HIV,Adolescent to Adult Patient-centered HIV Transition (ADAPT) Study, One of the distinct challenges faced by emerging adults with HIV is the transition of their care from their long-term pediatric HIV provider to treatment within an adult HIV program. The consequences of an unsuccessful transition can range from difficult to catastrophic. The Adolescent to Adult Patient-centered HIV Transition (ADAPT) Study is a randomized trial of innovative interventions targeting gaps in care that are major drivers of loss in the ART continuum of care cascade among adolescents and increasing missed opportunities to engage adolescents into care. The specific aims of ADAPT are: 1. To inform strategies for transition services in resource-limited settings; 2. To examine the developmental clinical and other factors that predict a successful transition; and 3. To gain fundamental insight on implementation barriers among African adolescents through the application of the ego-network defined social support that will inform targets for structured intervention. ADAPT will be conducted in central southern and northern Nigeria at selected PEPFAR sites supported by the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria. To address Aim 1 the investigators will conduct six focus groups including: Adolescent patients parents and health care providers. To address aim 2 the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized clinical trial. The two interventions are based on prior evidence-informed engagement strategies: 1) educational interventions and 2) interventions that use a peer transition advocate who prepares the adolescent and their parents for transition. The investigators will enroll 300 patients (150 patients in each arm). The sites will be randomized to an intervention. The primary outcome will be successful transition keeping two follow-up appointments within a nine months period following transition. Secondary outcomes as recommended by focus group participants will also be measured. To examine the potential role of social network components and characteristics of both egos and alters on primary outcomes a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) approach will be used to explore the associations between primary outcomes and factors at the ego alter and network levels. The finding from this study will guide institution of best practices for transitioning adolescents in Nigeria and other countries lower and middle income countries with similar challenges and potential for high impact.    ,NCT02872805
HIV,Mechanisms of Diastolic Dysfunction Among Persons With HIV Compared With Non-HIV Control Subjects, In this study investigators plan to test two potential mechanisms contributing to diastolic dysfunction among asymptomatic persons with HIV who are on cART. The first proposed mechanism is that heightened systemic immune activation/inflammation in HIV contributes to myocardial inflammation which in turn promotes myocardial fibrosis. The second mechanism is that ectopic fat deposition (increased visceral adiposity) in HIV relates to increased intramyocardial lipid content which in turn contributes to diastolic dysfunction. Both HIV positive and HIV-negative participants will undergo cardiac MRI/ MRS imaging studies for evaluation of myocardial fibrosis myocardial inflammation and intramyocardial lipid content. Traditional markers of CVD risk inflammatory markers/immune hormonal markers and markers of myocardial stretch/injury will be assessed in relation to cardiac MRI/MRS outcomes.    ,NCT02874703

HIV,Adherence to Dolutegravir and Outcome, The main assumption is that the dolutegravir can get virologic suppression to suboptimal adherence levels (between 80 and 95% and after treatment interruptions) where other molecules are not capable due to their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pardonnance). While the investigators goal is not to compare molecules (study with one arm) in terms of forgiveness the results of this cohort in terms of forgiveness could be compared to other cohorts available.    ,NCT02878642
HIV,Evaluation of Neurologic and Psychiatric Adverse Events of Several Antiretroviral Drugs in Real Life Setting, The frequency of neurological and psychiatric complaints for participants taking rilpivirine elvitegravir or dolutegravir reaches on average 20??0% during clinical trials. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolling people living with HIV are at times so selective and the subsequent descriptions of minor or severe adverse events (AE's) so often imprecise and ambiguous that one cannot extrapolate these particular research results to practicing medicine. These adverse events negatively affect the patient's quality of life and ultimately his or her good adherence to treatments. This study aims at assessing the prevalence and at describing the neurological and psychiatric adverse events related to these drugs.    ,NCT02882230

HIV,Simplified Algorithm for Treatment Eligibility," In its 2015 revision of the global guidelines for HIV care and treatment the World Health Organization called for initiating lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART) for all patients testing positive for HIV regardless of CD4 cell count. As countries adopt the new recommendation known as ""treat all"" millions of additional patients are becoming eligible for ART worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa where most of these patients are located studies continue to document high losses of treatment-eligible patients from care before they receive their first dose of antiretroviral medications. Among facility-level reasons for these losses are treatment initiation protocols that require multiple clinic visits and long waiting times before a patient who tests positive for HIV is dispensed an initial supply of medications. Simpler more efficient accelerated algorithms for ART initiation will be needed if ""treat all"" is to realize the benefits expected. Experts have proposed a simplified clinical algorithm to screen patients for eligibility for immediate ART initiation at a patient's first clinic visit without the use of point-of-care laboratory test technologies. The Simplified Algorithm for Treatment Eligibility (SLATE) uses four screens to assess whether a patient is eligible for same-day treatment initiation: i) symptom report ii) medical history iii) brief physical examination; and iv) readiness assessment. SLATE is a pragmatic individually randomized evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the algorithm in increasing ART initiation among non-pregnant adult patients. Approximately 960 HIV-infected adult patients not yet on ART will be enrolled during a routine clinic visit and randomized to receive the intervention or standard care. Patients in the intervention arm will be administered the SLATE screens; those found eligible under the algorithm will be offered immediate treatment initiation while those who are not eligible will be referred for standard clinic care. Patients in the standard arm will be referred for ART initiation under standard clinic procedures. All care after the initial visit will be by the clinic under standard of care. If successful SLATE will offer a standardized approach to collecting and interpreting a minimum set of patient data that will avoid delaying treatment initiation for the majority of patients who are eligible for immediate ART while deferring initiation in the minority who should not start immediately.

HIV,Study to Explore Natural Daily Variation and Impact of Stress in HIV Levels," Despite advances in AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART) leading to a rapid control of the HIV virus in individuals affected HIV can persist indefinitely and there is no cure. The HIV virus has been shown to have a unique ability to hide within the human gene inside human cells and in tissues remaining 'silent' and rapidly reactivate 'waking up"" if ART is stopped. There are a number of ways to measure the silent HIV reservoir including a common research-based laboratory test called Cell-Associated UnSpliced (CA-US) HIV RNA. This is an early marker of the HIV virus waking up. It is often used to test how well new drugs developed to eliminate the silent virus might work. This study is examining whether the diurnal variation (daily rhythm) and/or stress can affect CA-US HIV RNA levels in individuals diagnosed with HIV and receiving ART.    ",NCT02895087

HIV,HIV Eradication Through Cord-blood Transplantation," Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from a CCR5 ?32/?32 unrelated donor performed for the first time in the ""Berlin patient"" provides the only evidence to date of long-term control of HIV infection. Stringent criteria to select human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched conventional donors and low prevalence of the CCR5 ?32/?32 homozygous genotype (<1%) made the pursuit of ""patient number 2"" unsuccessful for many years. Cord blood (CB) transplantation allows more permissive HLA-matching criteria making the search for HLA-compatible ?32/?32 CB units potentially feasible for transplantation of HIV-infected individuals. The investigator team involved in this trial has recently reported the first such case of CCR5 delta32/delta32 CB transplantation in a patient with HIV infection showing a reduction of the patient's latent viral reservoir and upon achievement of full CB chimerism resistance of his CD4 T-lymphocytes to infection by HIV. This proof of concept led the Spanish National Transplant Organization (ONT) to generate an inventory of over 150 CCR5 ?32/?32 CB units readily available for transplant. From this initial evidence and repository of CB units financial support from the Fundación Mutua Madrileña (FMM) has allowed the investigators to launch this first pilot clinical trial in this indication. The study was launched in January 2016 at Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda. All HIV virology and reservoir analyses are carried out by the AIDS Immunopathology Unit at the Spanish Instituto de Salud Carlos III.

HIV,HOPE Social Media Intervention for HIV Testing and Studying Social Networks, This study [HOPE: Harnessing Online Peer Education] seeks to determine the efficacy of using online social networks to scale peer community leader models to increase HIV prevention within African-American and Latino men who have sex with men. The peer community leader model which teaches community popular opinion leaders about how to disseminate behavior changes messages throughout the community has been proven to increase HIV prevention behaviors. Social networks such as Facebook.com may be a cost-effective platform for scaling these models. Primarily upper middle-class White populations used the Internet in its early years however Internet use within African-American and Latino households has recently increased dramatically especially on online social networks such as Facebook.com. People using the Internet may be at the highest risk for contracting HIV and are using novel Internet approaches to find sex partners such as through online social networks.

HIV,OPEN Study: Pain Management Treatment Needs Interviews, Presently there are few options for medically managing HIV-related painful peripheral sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN). Psychological treatments including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) represent a potentially viable addition to the treatment of painful HIV-SN. However there is a scarcity of research on psychological treatment approaches for pain management in people with HIV. This study will use in-depth semi-structured interviews to examine the needs of people with painful HIV-SN for a psychologically-based pain management treatment that may be delivered over the Internet. Interview questions will examine participants' needs in terms of treatment content and delivery format. Men and women ethnic minorities and people who use recreational drugs will be sampled to ensure that interview responses reflect the views of people most commonly suffering from this condition. Approximately 30 people will be recruited for the study. The interviews will be audio recorded transcribed verbatim and coded to identify themes. The interview responses will be used to develop and tailor a version of CBT for people with painful HIV-SN. It is hoped that tailoring the treatment based on the qualitative interview responses will increase the acceptability of the treatment and will improve treatment adherence rates for a future study.    ,NCT02972606
Hiv,LoViReT (Low Viral Reservoir Treated Patients)," The main purpose of this study is to unravel the mechanisms by which the ""Low Viral Reservoir Treated"" patients (LoViReT) maintain extremely low HIV-1 DNA levels despite having initiated cART during chronic HIV-1 infection.

Hiv,Sex Hormone Therapy and Mucosal Tissues, The purpose of this research study is to better understand how sex hormone therapy that is used to treat women for menopausal symptoms men with low testosterone or as hormone therapy for transgender women affects a class of medications called NRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) used to treat and prevent HIV infection. The two most commonly used NRTIs are tenofovir and emtricitabine which are the components of the drug Truvada and also included in the combination products Atripla Complera and Stribild. The medication's ability to work effectively may be altered when someone is also taking sex hormone therapy. In order to determine this effect samples will be collected from some parts of the body where HIV makes copies. These samples will be measured for the levels of HIV medication HIV virus and sex hormones that are present. The samples that will be looked at in this study include blood cells from the vagina semen and tissue biopsies from the female genital tract and rectum.    ,NCT02983110
HIV,Identification and Quantification of HIV CNS Latency Biomarkers," Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains in infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for many years. Stopping HAART usually leads to re-emergence of small reservoirs of latent (inactive) HIV that reside inside certain types of infected cells that can replicate and cause a full HIV infection. Chronic HIV infection also leads to long-term immune activation which is associated with higher incidence of serious non-AIDS events including cardiovascular disease and cancers. Thus HIV+ patients must remain on HAART indefinitely or replication-competent latent HIV reservoirs must be eradicated. The central nervous system (CNS) is a sanctuary site for latent HIV. For example HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) develop and persist in about 40% of HIV+ persons despite long-term HAART and viral suppression in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Continued CSF immune activation is also frequently observed despite viral suppression. Both of these are likely to indicate ongoing low-level HIV replication in the CNS. Several strategies to eradicate latent HIV are being explored. One of these known as ""shock and kill"" involves ""awakening"" latent HIV and inducing replication to make it more susceptible to host immune responses and HAART. However there are several major caveats to its application in the CNS such as the risk of triggering a serious immunoinflammatory response (e.g. meningoencephalitis) that cannot be easily controlled by HAART. Other eradication strategies may also be problematic given that many latency-reversing agents have limited penetration of the blood brain barrier and limited efficacy in astrocyte cells. To improve the effectiveness of new eradication therapies it will be crucial to develop better methods to identify and quantify latent HIV reservoir sites with greater precision. To identify potential HIV latency biomarkers in the CNS the investigators will study HIV+ patients stable on HAART and virally-suppressed in blood and CSF over 24 months. Because such a marker should be associated with HAND or its development without changing significantly with HAND progression half of the sample will have HAND at study entry and half will not. Patients will undergo neuropsychological testing and give blood and CSF samples every 6 months to identify candidate biomarkers and track them prospectively against HAND development and progression. MRI brain scan will also occur at study entry and after 24 months.    ",NCT02989285

HIV,HIV Testing at Family Planning Clinics in Mombasa County Kenya, Location: Family Planning Clinics in Mombasa County Kenya Introduction: Integration of HIV treatment and prevention with family planning (FP) services is a promising approach for optimizing delivery of comprehensive healthcare for HIV-positive women as well as prevention services for those who are negative. In Mombasa County the USAID-supported AIDS Population and Health Integrated Assistance II Program revised the FP Clinic Register to capture HIV testing in 2008. However the rate of HIV testing in FP clinics remains low. Our overarching objective is to assess the effectiveness costs and budget impact of implementing the systems analysis and improvement approach (SAIA) to increase HIV testing in FP clinics in Mombasa County. Methods: The investigators aim to conduct a cluster-randomized trial comparing the effect of the SAIA approach versus usual procedures on rates of HIV testing in first-time attendees at 20 intervention versus 20 control FP clinics in Mombasa County. The investigators will compare HIV testing rates for first-time FP clinic attendees in SAIA intervention versus control facilities after an additional year during which FP clinics in the intervention arm will be encouraged to continue to use the SAIA tools with minimal support from the study team as the Mombasa County Ministry of Health will take ownership of implementation. Lastly the investigators aim to estimate the incremental cost and budget impact of applying SAIA versus standard of care using an activity-based approach. Anticipated Results: The investigators anticipate that SAIA will produce significant and sustained improvement in HIV-testing rates in first-time FP clinic attendees in intervention clinics compared to control facilities. The use of a rigorous study design will provide strong evidence to guide integration of HIV testing into FP services in a wide range of settings. The inclusion of costing and budget impact analyses will assist policy makers in reaching informed decisions about implementation. Anticipated Conclusion: By addressing the crucial first step in the linkage of HIV and FP services this research holds considerable promise for improving women's health by opening the gateway to HIV care and prevention.    ,NCT02994355

Hiv,Tenofovir Adherence to Rapidly Guide and Evaluate PrEP and HIV Therapy, Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are critical to the success of HIV treatment and therapeutic prevention. No accurate objective point-of-care test is available to monitor adherence to either ART or PrEP. The inability to accurately identify poorly adherent patients will lead to more HIV infections (from failed PrEP and non-suppressive ART) more drug-resistant virus (selected by failing ART) and unnecessary switching to costly second- or third-line ART (when first-line regimens with virologic efficacy but non-adherence are stopped inappropriately). To address this critical knowledge gap the investigators have developed a novel point-of-care test to detect the presence of tenofovir?the most common drug in both ART and PrEP treatments worldwide?in fingerprick blood or urine as an objective measure of ART and PrEP adherence. Our central hypothesis is that the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in blood and urine will support point-of-care tenofovir detection as an objective measure of adherence and that our point-of-care tenofovir assay will have the ability to discriminate different drug adherence levels. The investigators will test our central hypotheses by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) To assess our novel point-of-care tenofovir (TFV) assay in whole blood and urine specimens within a controlled pharmacokinetic study of HIV-negative adults receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) with low moderate and perfect adherence; and (2) To validate our novel point-of-care tenofovir (TFV) assay on blood and urine specimens using an existing biorepository from a real-world clinical HIV prevention study. This work is innovative because it develops an entirely new category of rapid diagnostic testing for monitoring ART and PrEP adherence at the clinical point of care. Our rapid assay will help clinicians identify patients in need of more adherence counseling which when implemented will prevent HIV acquisition emergence of drug resistant virus and unnecessary ART regimen switching?measures that will improve national HIV programs and help preserve the global supply of an effective HIV medication.    ,NCT03012607

HIV,American Indian and Alaska Native Men Who Have Sex With Men HIV & Substance Abuse Research, This is a pilot study of the feasibility of the virtually reality online culturally grounded HIV prevention intervention for Native American men who have sex with men. The project will include 90 Native American men who have sex with men (MSM) from across the continental United States as well as Alaska and Hawaii. The investigators will use a randomized clinical trial with a waitlist control condition to evaluate the intervention's impact on HIV / Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) testing behavior condom use and substance use harm reduction. Specifically investigators will ask participants to spend 3 weeks exploring a virtual reality environment hosted in the Second Life® platform. The island consists of 3 levels: Learning Level Skills building level and Experiential level. In the Learning level the participant's avatar will have the opportunity to attend up to 2 free Motivational Interviewing sessions to establish their goals for their time on the island. Additionally they will explore 4 learning paths each covering a knowledge objective: HIV Testing Condom Use & Condom Use Negotiation Safer Sex and Harm Reduction. Each path will present knowledge via videos interactive games stories and teachings. After completing level 1 participants will move on to the Skills building level. Here participants will have the opportunity to role play scenarios (e.g. obtaining an HIV test requesting PrEP from their doctor negotiating condom use) with pre-program virtual actors. All scenarios are based on the knowledge gained in the Learning Level. Participants will also engage on mini-quests for additional knowledge and in-world rewards. Finally in the third level participants will be able to practice the skills learned in interactions with other participants' avatars. If efficacious this online HIV prevention intervention has the potential for widespread dissemination and could be particularly helpful for rural and reservation-based Native MSM who often have difficulty accessing services and support.    ,NCT03049904

Hiv,Impact of Antiretroviral Treatment on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Thienopyridines in Healthy Volunteers and HIV Patients," HIV patients are at particular risk to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) as they exhibit multiple risk factors by the nature of their pathology. In addition the long term exposition to antiretroviral drugs has been associated to an increased risk for CVD. HIV patients can thus potentially receive antiplatelet therapy concomitantly with their antiretroviral treatment. Clopidogrel and prasugrel are thienopyridine antiplatelet agents indicated to prevent the recurrence of ischemic events after coronary arteries stenting. These pro-drugs are mainly bioactivated by cytochromes P450 (CYP) 3A and 2B6 for prasugrel and CYP2C19 CYP3A and CYP2B6 for clopidogrel. Ritonavir is commonly used to ""boost"" the bioavailability of other HIV drugs through inhibition of CYP3A4 as well as CYP2B6 and CYP2C9. This interaction could therefore reduce clopidogrel and prasugrel efficacy by reducing the formation of their active metabolites. The aim of the present study is to assess the potential drug-drug interaction between clopidogrel/prasugrel and ritonavir. Two groups of 12 male subjects will be constituted (12 HIV patients under ritonavir boosted therapy and 12 healthy volunteers) in a randomized cross-over clinical trial. All subjects will also be genotyped for the CYP2C19. The pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel active metabolite and prasugrel active metabolite will be assessed. Furthermore the pharmacodynamic response will be evaluated by two gold standard platelet inhibition tests namely VAsodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein Assay (VASP) and VerifyNow® assays. The primary endpoint of this study is to compare the pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel and prasugrel in HIV patients to that of healthy volunteers.    ",NCT03054207

HIV,mVIP (Use of mHealth Technology for Supporting Symptom Management in Underserved Persons Living With HIV), The goal of this study is to facilitate the dissemination and implementation of patient centered outcomes research using mHealth technology to improve self-management of adverse symptoms in persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). Symptom management in PLWH is especially important because the US HIV epidemic continues to exact a huge toll especially among Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) priority populations including racial ethnic and sexual minorities and low-income persons. The incorporation of HIV symptom management strategies into patients' lives through the use of mHealth technologies has the potential to advance the effective dissemination and implementation of patient centered outcomes research findings.    ,NCT02897141

HIV,Family Planning and HIV in Postpartum Women in Mbarara, Supporting HIV positive women to delay or prevent an unwanted pregnancy may improve women's health through family planning choices regular health reviews and support. A cohort study that was done in Mbarara amongst HIV-infected women documented 50% of the enrolled women having no desire for a (another) child during the 4 years since ART initiation 51% had a serodiscordant partner with only 45% using effective contraceptive method. Key predictors of contraceptive use were family planning goals within the DYAD. One of the key predictors of effective contraceptive use was male partner involvement and CD4 count. The WHO recommends dual contraception (use of condoms and a hormonal or permanent method) to prevent both HIV transmission and unwanted pregnancies (WHO2014).This prospective intervention study aims at providing information on whether continuous family planning accessibility and support has a measurable impact on pregnancy intentions and contraceptive usage among postpartum HIV positive mothers delivering at MRRH SW Uganda.    ,NCT02964169
HIV,Use of OraQuick for Screening HIV in Children Less Than Eighteen Months Old, Blood is the most commonly used specimen to test for HIV. In the past 20 years use of saliva as an alternative specimen for HIV testing has been explored. Today very sensitive tests have been formulated and have been used for diagnosing HIV in adults and older children. OraQuick a rapid test is one such example. It is a devise that can be used to collect as well test the saliva. Most studies done on the use of saliva have been carried out in adults and have produced very good results. However very few such studies have been done in children especially infants. In adults use of saliva has also highlighted the advantages of ease of collection and increased acceptability of testing. HYPOTHESIS OraQuick rapid test can detect antiHIV antibodies as well as the Abbott determine test and oral fluid testing is more acceptable than blood testing.    ,NCT00378118

HIV,Testosterone and Physical Function in HIV+ Men, Men infected with the HIV virus (the virus that causes AIDS) often lose weight even though they may try to eat more food to gain weight. The reasons for this weight loss are not clear. Many men with HIV have low levels of testosterone in their blood. Testosterone is a hormone that is naturally produced in the bodies of both men and women and has important effects on building muscle and bone mass. The purpose of this study is to find out if providing additional testosterone to HIV infected men who have low testosterone can help them gain weight increase their muscle mass and feel better. The study will also help see if testosterone improves the efficiency with which your body produces and uses energy including fat. The dose of testosterone being used in this study will raise testosterone levels in the blood to higher than normal levels (2-3 times normal level).    ,NCT00260143

HIV,Switching From Zidovudine to an NNRTI or Lopinavir/Ritonavir in Patients Treated With Zidovudine/ Lamivudine/Abacavir., Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the long time survival of HIV infected individuals. However an increasing number of HIV-patients have developed metabolic and morphological alterations including peripheral lipoatrophy. The main hypothesis of the study is that switching from thymidine-analogue based HAART will reverse lipoatrophy. We plan to perform an observational study recruiting up to 100 HIV-infected patients receiving Trizivir (zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir). The patients will be offered an NRTI or lopinavir/ritonavir instead of zidovudine or they can choose to continue with Trizivir. The main endpoint is changes in peripheral fat mass as determined by DEXA-scanning.    ,NCT00139178
HIV,Study of Paroxetine and Fluconazole for the Treatment of HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorder, The purpose of this study is to see if paroxetine and fluconazole are safe and effective as a treatment for problems with memory concentration thinking and judgment in people who are infected with HIV. Paroxetine is an antidepressant approved by the FDA to treat major depression. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication approved by the FDA to treat fungal infections.    ,NCT01354314
HIV,Observational Study of HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder, It is estimated that over 1 million people in the United States have HIV infection. While HIV is treatable there are still high rates of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). HAND is defined by low scores on memory testing. To meet the criteria for HAND an HIV-infected individual has to have a low score on at least two different memory tests. It is estimated that 20-50% of people living with HIV have HAND. It is therefore still a common problem. While individuals with HAND typically improve on antiretroviral therapy for HIV often this improvement is incomplete. Also there are over 20 antiretroviral medications approved for HIV in the US. It is not clear if the specific choice of antiretroviral medication makes a difference in the improvement of HAND. The investigators have designed a small preliminary study in which subjects with and without HAND who have never been on treatment for HIV or have been off treatment for at least 6 months are followed for the first 12 months after starting antiretroviral therapy.The investigators will enroll a maximum of 46 subjects (23 subjects in each arm). Subjects will also be followed by their primary HIV medical provider. For the study subjects will be followed for 48 weeks. There are three followup visits: 12 weeks 24 weeks and 48 weeks. Memory testing will be performed at baseline and each followup visit. Blood will also be taken at baseline and the three followup visits to measure changes in inflammation. A lumbar puncture will be performed at baseline and at 24 weeks to measure changes in inflammation and amount of HIV virus in the spinal fluid. There is also an optional lumbar puncture at the last study visit of 48 weeks    ,NCT01966094

HIV,Modulation of Monocyte Activation by Atorvastatin in HIV Infection, Activated monocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Individuals with HAND have expanded populations of activated monocytes. These monocytes are thought to emigrate into the CNS where they produce neurotoxic proinflammatory factors and also carry virus into the CNS. Statins are cholesterol lowering drugs with pleiotropic immunomodulatory / anti-inflammatory properties that are currently being explored for immunomodulation of T cell activation in several diseases in addition to their established role to treat hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. The investigators in vitro data suggests that these drugs can downregulate monocyte activation patterns seen in HIV infection. No in vivo studies have yet been carried out to assess the effects of statins on the pro-inflammatory monocyte population in chronic HIV disease. This will be a pilot study of whether statin treatment will reduce the inflammatory monocyte phenotype and downregulate the inflammatory cytokines that have been linked to neuropathogenesis in HIV infection. If so they may have potential as adjunctive therapy in HIV-associated neurological disease. The investigators propose to:   -  Determine the effect of Atorvastatin on peripheral blood monocyte populations in a 12-week pilot study in chronically HIV-infected people on HAART therapy.   -  Determine the relationship between changes in monocyte phenotype following Atorvastatin treatment and soluble markers of activation/inflammation linked to neuropathogenesis as well as activation status of T cells.    ,NCT01263938
HIV,A Study Comparing Long-acting Methylphenidate (ConcertaTM) vs. Placebo in the Treatment of Memory Loss Due to HIV," This study is being done to see if a drug called long acting methylphenidate (Concerta) is safe and effective as a treatment for problems with mental function in adults infected with HIV. A subset of patients with HIV-associated memory loss have a defect in the speed with which they learn and process information. Methylphenidate drugs such as Ritalin or Concerta have been shown on tests to improve the ability to rapidly absorb information; these tests are called ""reaction time tests"". These drugs are already FDA-approved to treat Attention Deficit Disorders: ADD or ADHD. At baseline all subjects get tests of memory and brain function; then they are split into two groups. One group on this study will receive Concerta for 2 weeks and a second group will receive a placebo x 2 weeks. After that period both groups will receive memory and other tests of brain function and then the groups will switch. The first group will receive placebo and the second will receive Concerta x 2 weeks followed by more memory and neurological tests. After that all subjects will have the option to receive Concerta for free for 8 more weeks. At the last visit all subjects get memory and brain tests again.    ",NCT01599975
HIV,Downmodulating Monocyte Activation for HIV-1 Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND), HIV associated neurological disorders (HAND) are a major problem even in ART treated people. HAND results from chronic inflammation which is largely attributed to expansion and activation of monocytes. These activated monocytes some of which also carry virus to the brain invade the CNS and release cytokines / chemokines resulting in further recruitment of monocytes as well as release viral proteins which injure neurons and cause activation of other brain cells. Persistent monocyte/macrophage activation is thus a potential critical target for adjunctive therapy to treat or prevent HAND. The investigators therefore propose to study the effects of a statin drug (Atorvastatin) which has anti-inflammatory functions on the monocyte activation status in vitro and in ART treated HIV+ individuals. The investigators objectives are based on the hypothesis that Atorvastatin treatment will reduce the inflammatory and activated phenotype and function of monocytes which have been linked to HIV associated neuropathogenesis and occur in HIV infected subjects despite ART. In this study the investigators propose to   1. determine how Atorvastatin modulates monocyte activation intracellular signaling pathways and functions implicated in the pathogenesis of HAND in vitro   2. define the effect of Atorvastatin on monocyte activation in HIV infected / ART treated subjects in a double blind placebo controlled crossover study   3. define gene expression patters of monocyte activation before and following statin treatment   4. assess Atorvastatin effects on CNS immune activation markers and neurocognitive function in ART treated subjects.    ,NCT01600170

HIV,Intranasal Insulin for the Treatment of HAND," Infection with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) can lead to problems with brain function such as memory concentration judgment and the speed or control of hands and legs. Neurologists have called this condition HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). This research is being done to see if insulin taken through the nose as a spray (intranasal insulin) can help people with HIV who are having problems with memory and brain function or HAND. Participants will be given either insulin or placebo. A placebo is an inactive substance that looks like the study drug but does not contain study drug. For this research study the placebo will be a clear saline-based liquid spray that looks like the insulin spray but has no insulin. Participants will not be told whether they receive insulin or placebo during the study. All participants will take the intranasal spray twice a day about 30 minutes after a meal. Participants will use a specialized intranasal drug administration device. The total daily dose of insulin is 40 IU split between 20 IU in the morning and 20 IU in the evening. Participants will take the intranasal spray for 24 weeks. The researchers will record symptoms and side effects during the study. Procedures include neurocognitive testing of memory and brain function two lumbar punctures (""spinal taps"") two MRI brain scans several blood draws and clinical assessments.    ",NCT03081117

HIV,Evaluation of 3TC or FTC Mono-therapy Compared to Continuing HAART as a Bridging Strategy, The purpose of this study was to compare the use of lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) alone vs. continuing a failing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen in HIV infected children adolescents and young adults. The study was to see if there were changes in the HIV virus and if there were differences in immune function viral load and medication side effects between the two groups over 28 weeks. Participants were assigned to either take 3TC or FTC alone or continue on his/her current failing HAART regimen. During the first 28 weeks of this study if the participant was randomized to the continue HAART arm he/she was not switched to a different or new potentially suppressive HAART regimen but continued on the current failing HAART regimen. However if continuing HAART the participant might be switched to a new regimen if their provider felt that it was clinically needed or the participant met certain study endpoints (e.g. drop in CD4 increase in viral load). At the end of 28 weeks the participant had the choice of remaining on the assigned study group medication(s) or starting a new HAART regimen prescribed by his/her doctor. Then they would be followed for another 24 weeks to compare the difference in immune function viral load and medication side effects between the different groups.    ,NCT01338025
HIV,Therapy to Elevate CD4 Counts in HIV-1 Disease, For more than 20 years alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor therapy (Zemaira®) has been the standard treatment for patients who have too little alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor in blood. Adult patients with this condition eventually develop emphysema. Most HIV-1 patients who have low viral load also have too little alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor in blood. Recent strong evidence shows that the number of CD4 cells in blood goes up when alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor goes up. Patients were asked to participate in a pilot study to see whether the use of Zemaira® (alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor) would increase blood levels of alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor and consequently increase CD4 cells.    ,NCT01370018
HIV,Vitamin D Supplementation in HIV-infected Youth, Along with its effects on bone metabolism vitamin D is an important modulator of the immune system. Experimental studies have shown that the active metabolite of vitamin D [125(OH)2D] is able to skew the T cell compartment into a more anti-inflammatory state with inhibition of Th1 and Th17 cells and promotion of Th2 and T regulatory subsets. In the context of HIV infection in which Th1 subpopulations are devoted to inhibit viral replication any alteration of the Th1/Th2 balance would be of concern. The aim of this Randomized Controlled Trial is to test wether oral supplementation with cholecalciferol could be able: 1) to improve vitamin D status and 2) to play an immunomodulatory role in vertically HIV-infected children and young adults with hypovitaminosis D.    ,NCT01656070

HIV,Advanced Neuroimaging Evaluation of the Central Nervous System Biological Changes Associated With Efavirenz Therapy and Switch to an Elvitegravir-based Regimen, In this study we will use a multi-modal imaging approach of MRS and fMRI to comprehensively assess the biological changes in the brain associated with EFV-based regimen (EFV/FTC/TDF) specifically alterations in the brain circuitry function and local neurochemistry and their correlation with neuropsychological function. In a cohort of HIV-infected patients who are clinically stable on the commonly use regimen of EFV/emtricitabine (FTC)/truvada (TDF) or Atripla we propose to replace the EFV component with a new integrase inhibitor elvitegravir (EVG) boosted with cobicistat (COBI) given as the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF Single Tablet Regimen (STR) to evaluate the EFV-related neural alterations. This is a multidisciplinary study which involves a team of infectious disease experts in the field of HIV neuroradiologists with expertise in fMRI and MRS techniques to study various central nervous system and psychiatric disorders and a psychiatrist with experience and expertise in research on abnormalities of affective and motivational processing in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders. We will utilize the established clinical research platform in the Infectious Disease outpatient clinical practice at the Brigham and Women's Hospital where there is currently have many ongoing HIV-related studies and a large panel of HIV-infected patients motivated to be involved in clinically relevant research. We propose to use advanced neuroimaging to measure biologically changes in the brain associated with long-term EFV use with the following specific aims:   1. Determine changes in neurometabolites measured by MRS in the brain associated with long-term EFV use   2. Assess for alterations in neural activity correlated with affective symptoms associated with EFV vs STR use using fMRI and their associations with changes in neurometabolites assessed by MRS and with changes in cognition assessed by Trail Making and Digit Substitution Tests.   3. Determine changes in emotion cognition and sleep quality after switching from EFV to STR and how they correlate with subject treatment preference. This clinical study will extend our current understanding of EFV neurotoxicity by further defining the nature of these biological changes. Further elucidation of the neurobiological underpinnings of EFV-induced CNS toxicity will have clinical relevance in improving the quality of life and drug adherence of HIV-infected patients on ART especially among older patients or those with baseline neuropsychiatric disorders whom at baseline are more vulnerable to neurocognitive decline from long-term HIV infection.    ,NCT01929759

HIV,Texting to Improve Adherence in HIV+ With Bipolar Disorder, Adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical for successful HIV viral suppression. Nonadherence to ART poses several potentially serious health consequences including higher viral loads faster progression to AIDS and a heightened risk of viral mutations treatment resistance and HIV transmission. The prevalence of serious mental illness (SMI) conditions including bipolar disorder (BD) is elevated among HIV-infected populations and is associated with poor ART adherence. HIV-infected individuals with co-occurring BD (HIV+/BD+) when compared to demographically similar HIV+/BD- persons demonstrated poorer ART and psychotropic medication adherence and were twice as likely to be non adherent to their ART regimen using a ??90% cutoff score. HIV+/BD+ individuals are particularly at-risk for medication non adherence and there is a critical need to develop interventions to improve adherence in this population. Poor psychotropic medication adherence is also common among people with SMI - it has been estimated that 40% of those with BD do not take their mood stabilizer as prescribed. Among persons with BD nonadherence to psychotropic medications can lead to greater risk for manic and depressive episodes decreased quality of life suicide attempts and hospitalization. The utilization of mobile health (i.e. mHealth) technologies to improve everyday functioning is growing. mHealth interventions capitalize on technology already incorporated into most people's daily lives (e.g. cell phones) to assist people with behavior modification and disease self-management. Text messaging in particular may support daily ART adherence by delivering reminders at precise times to match an individuals' dosing schedule. The initial evidence for using text messaging to improve ART medication adherence has been compelling. Researchers and clinicians have also started employing technology-based approaches to improve treatment for individuals with BD. Taken together a distinct need for RCTs utilizing text messaging to improve medication adherence within an at-risk HIV population is warranted. Individualized Texting for Adherence Building (iTAB) is one such intervention. The investigators propose an intervention development study designed to address these potential mechanisms of nonadherence with the following Specific Aims: 1) To further develop and refine a personalized automated real-time mobile phone text messaging intervention (iTAB) designed to improve adherence to ART and psychotropic medications among HIV+/BD+ persons; 2) To evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a brief psychoeducation plus text messaging intervention (iTAB) as compared to psychoeducation alone (CTRL) for the improvement of objectively measured medication adherence among HIV+/BD+ persons; and 3) To examine predictors of within-person trajectories of nonadherence using the longitudinal data collected over the study. In order to realize these aims the investigators will leverage the infrastructure of two unique UCSD resources increasing likelihood of study success impact and innovation: 1) the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program (HNRP) which encompasses multiple NIH-funded studies that focus on the effects of HIV infection and 2) the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) which conducts research on state-of-the-art wireless means of health promotion. Initially the investigators will refine the iTAB intervention to ensure that it is user-centered and tailored to the needs of HIV+/BD+ persons via focus groups and rapid prototyping. Once refined the proposed iTAB intervention will use text messages that are automated scalable personalized interactive flexible and motivating. The investigators will assess the acceptability and effectiveness of iTAB in improving objectively measured adherence (i.e. MEMS caps) over a 4-week period via a pilot RCT with 25 HIV+/BD+ assigned to the iTAB intervention and 25 HIV+/BD+ assigned to a psychoeducational control. Predictors of nonadherence including neuropsychological impairment and mood will be examined to determine whether iTAB is better able to compensate for these factors associated with nonadherence as compared to CTRL. Further refinement to the iTAB intervention will be made in order to pursue a large-scale R01 using the investigators tailored intervention.    ,NCT02090634
HIV,Autonomic Neuropathy GI Motility and Inflammation in HIV, The purpose of this study is to explore a possible link between the autonomic nervous system and immune function in patients with HIV. Sometimes HIV can cause these nerves to function abnormally this is called HIV-associated autonomic neuropathy (HIV-AN). HIV-AN is a condition that is different from person to person. In some people it causes no symptoms and is not harmful in others it may cause symptoms such as dizziness or lightheadedness nausea vomiting diarrhea constipation or problems urinating. Most people with HIV-AN don't know that they have it. One of the important nerves in the autonomic nervous system is the vagus nerve. Abnormal function of the vagus nerve may cause stomach and intestinal slowing which could lead to an overgrowth of bacteria. The body senses these bacteria and tries to fight them leading to inflammation. In this study the researchers will test whether abnormal function of the vagus nerve in HIV is associated with stomach slowing and overgrowth of bacteria and if a drug called pyridostigmine can help.    ,NCT02850276
HIV,Progression of HIV-Disease Under Low Dose Corticosteroids, There has been reports that low dose prednisolone stabilizes CD4-counts in HIV infected individuals. However until now there are no prospective randomized studies on the use of corticosteroids in latent HIV disease. Furthermore low dose prednisolone (5 mg/d) is not sufficient tested for the risks and benefit for HIV patients especially for those living in poor settings with a higher risk of infections. This study will assess the benefit and the safety profile for low dose prednisolone therapy for patients in a region with limited resources and high prevalence of infections.    ,NCT01299948
HIV,Resistance in HIV+ in North and South, The investigators aim to assess type and frequency of HIV drug resistance in adults presenting to the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) in Kampala Uganda and compare this data to patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). This study is a single-site cross-sectional study. The Investigators' goal is to perform viral load measurements in 2750 HIV-infected patients who have been on ART for 6 months or more. Presuming a detectable viral load in 10% resistance testing would then be performed in 250 patients on ART. All adult patients attending will be screened for enrollment. Furthermore the investigators' goal is to perform resistance testing in 250 ART naive patients in order to detect transmitted resistance mutations. Investigators will therefore consecutively screen and enroll 250 ART naive patients who attend the clinic during the study period. For each participant a case report form (CRF) form will be completed which includes social as well as medical information. Investigators will ask each participant for permission to store plasma in case resistance testing must be repeated and serum in case of future research questions.    ,NCT02507921

HIV,Early Versus Delayed BCG Vaccination of HIV-exposed Infants, In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) more than 300000 babies with HIV die each year. HIV-infected children develop AIDS and die faster in SSA than those in developed countries. Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is given to infants at birth in SSA to protect them from severe forms of TB. BCG is known to cause immune cells to be active and replicate faster. The immune system of neonates also responds differently to BCG that to other vaccines and infections. We hypothesize that the routine immunization of neonates with BCG contributes to generalized immune activation in HIV-exposed infants resulting in skewed immune responses to vaccines and infections and increased rates of disease progression in those infants that become HIV-infected. However delaying BCG until HIV testing is completed would result in operational difficulties and may not induce the appropriate immune response. Delayed BCG would also render many HIV-exposed uninfected infants at high risk for disseminated TB. We plan to assess immune cells in infants to determine the impact of the timing of BCG vaccination on immune responses to tuberculosis (TB) and other vaccines. We will also compare the immune activation and disease progression of those infants that become HIV-infected in the BCG or control arms. Our results will provide key insights into the effect of BCG vaccination on immune responses to HIV as well as inform the optimal timing of BCG vaccination for HIV-exposed infants.    ,NCT02062580
HIV,Voluma Filler Agent For The Treatment of HIV-associated Facial Lipoatrophy, The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Voluma and see what effects it has on HIV facial lipoatrophy. The hypothesis is that Voluma will be safe efficacious and positively impact the quality-of-life in the treatment of facial lipoatrophy in patients with HIV.    ,NCT02342223
HIV,Facilitating HIV/AIDS and HIV Testing Literacy for Emergency Department Patients, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all patients should receive information about HIV/AIDS and HIV testing orally or in writing at every HIV testing encounter. However for busy emergency departments (EDs) delivering information orally is a barrier to HIV testing and written brochures likely are not useful for those with lower health or general literacy. Videos might be as or more efficacious than orally-delivered information in improving HIV/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge particularly for those with lower health literacy skills. However the resources required to show videos might limit their use in EDs. Pictorial brochures are a promising alternative but are of unknown efficacy. The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine if HIV/AIDS and HIV testing information should be delivered by a video or pictorial brochure to emergency department (ED) patients to improve short-term (in the ED) knowledge about HIV/AIDS and HIV testing; (2) determine if longer-term retention (over 12 months) of HIV/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge is greater for those who watch a video or review a pictorial brochure; (3) determine if short-term improvement and longer-term retention in HIV/AIDS and HIV testing knowledge is better after watching a video or reviewing a pictorial brochure for those with lower health literacy and if improvement and retention also varies by language spoken (English or Spanish); and (4) if willingness to be tested again in one year is greater for those who watch the video or review the pictorial brochure and if this willingness also varies by health literacy level and language spoken.    ,NCT02284451
HIV,Counseling for HIV and STIs Screening, The primary objective of the study is to evaluate and compare in at-risk populations the efficacy of three different counseling methods in terms of propensity to come back for a HIV re-test. Secondary objectives are to evaluate and compare the efficacy of the counseling methods in terms of reported risk behavior and HIV knowledge as well as their acceptability and cost-effectiveness describe the distribution of duration from HIV primary infection to detection and estimate the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B and C and syphilis in HIV-uninfected participants of targeted populations.    ,NCT02752152
HIV,COMO: Cognition Study With HIV+ Patients (CTNPT 015), The purpose of this study is to contribute evidence towards the potential to improve cognition in HIV+ individuals experiencing cognitive decline through personalized change in antiretroviral (ARV) medication. To that end following a comprehensive evaluation to identify confounding clinical conditions study participants will undergo a lumbar puncture to: (i) measure viral load (at 2 copies/ml); (ii) identify Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) genotype and tropism; and (iii) measure concentration of antiretroviral agents. When indicated from the CSF analysis a personalized change in ARV will be implemented. Cognition will be measured in all at study entry and 6 months later.    ,NCT02144688
HIV,Cognitive Training for the Remediation of Functional Brain Health in HIV, Cognitive deficits in HIV reflect degraded brain network functioning that may be amenable to remediation through cognitive training. In this sub-study we will make use of Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Remediation (PACR) which applies well-understood techniques derived from brain plasticity and implicit/procedural/perceptual learning to improve the speed and accuracy of information processing with exercises that are designed to drive generalized improvements. Simultaneously these exercises heavily engage neuromodulatory systems to re-establish their normal control over learning and memory. As an individual restores these degraded abilities through intensive procedural learning the encoding of naturalistic information significantly improves and all resulting declarative memory and cognitive functions based on the quality of that incoming information necessarily improve as well leading to improvement that generalizes beyond the trained tasks. A subset of 80 HIV+ individuals will undergo eight weeks of PACR to determine its feasibility and appropriateness for people with mild cognitive difficulties related to HIV infection. The results of this study are expected to be pivotal in generating data to create an optimal training program aimed at stabilizing or improving brain function in HIV infected individuals experiencing cognitive decline.    ,NCT02571504
HIV,A Sleep Program to Improve Sleep Quality in People With HIV, Sleep problems such as insomnia are more frequent and intense in individuals living with HIV. These sleep difficulties can increase the difficulties in thinking and concentrating. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) is a computer-based treatment intervention that provides strategies to improve sleep. This intervention has been shown to improve sleep and daytime function (concentration productivity) in people with insomnia. However the effects of this intervention in people living with HIV are unknown.    ,NCT02571595
HIV,Immunogenicity Study of Vacc-4x Versus Placebo in Patients Infected With HIV, Current management of HIV infection includes anti-retroviral therapy (ART). ART cannot cure the infection making it a life-long treatment that requires sustained patient compliance and imposes significant individual and societal financial burdens on healthcare services. Furthermore ART side effects often require medication that increases the inconveniences and financial burdens of HIV management. Of further concern is the emergence of viruses resistant to ART that can result in treatment failure. ART-free periods could provide substantial benefit. Vacc-4x is a peptide-based HIV immunotherapy that is proposed for prolongation of ART-free periods. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Vacc-4x immunotherapy can give safe ART-free period.    ,NCT00659789
HIV,Safety and Efficacy of Romidepsin and the Therapeutic Vaccine Vacc-4x for Reduction of the Latent HIV?? Reservoir, The REDUC trial's objective is to address one of the core issues with the treatment of HIV which is that some HIV infected cells hide in so-called latent reservoirs. The reservoirs are unaffected by conventional HIV medication and invisible to the immune system. HDACi have the potential to activate these latently infected cells. This will make the HIV infected cells visible to the immune system; the immune response generate by Vacc-4x will be able to attack and eliminate the infected cells.    ,NCT02092116
HIV,A Study to Explore Reconstitution of Immunity in Patients With Advanced HIV-1-infection, RESTORE study:Thailand is a prospective observational study of HIV-1-infected patients who are either treatment naïve or who have been off anti-retroviral therapy for a ??2 months who have a CD4+ T cell count less than or equal to 350 cells/µL and who have been deemed by their treating physician that commencement of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) which is expected to reduce plasma HIV RNA by ??log10 copies/mL is necessary. The primary intent of this protocol is to prospectively establish a cohort of patients from whom clinical data and peripheral blood samples (serum plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells) can be stored for substudies examining reconstitution of the immune system and its relationship to disease outcomes.    ,NCT01296373
HIV,Impact of Menstrual Cycle on Antiretroviral Pharmacokinetics in HIV-Infected Women, Data suggests that women taking drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have higher amounts of drugs in their body compared with men taking the same dose of anti-HIV drugs. The reason for this higher drug exposure has not yet been determined. The primary purpose of this study is to examine whether a pharmacokinetics (factors that determine the amount of drug in the body) of anti-HIV drugs change during different phases of the menstrual cycle in women and ultimately result in higher amounts of drug in the body compared with men. In other words we plan to examine whether changes in sex hormones throughout the menstrual cycle affect the amount of anti-HIV drugs in HIV infected women. The antiretroviral drugs atazanavir ritonavir tenofovir and emtricitabine will be studied.    ,NCT01394133
HIV,The Influence of Psychological Interventions Upon Disease Progression in HIV-infected Patients Receiving no Medication, This study examines the hypothesis that psychological interventions have beneficial effects on quality of life including psychological well-being and disease progression in early HIV patients recieving no medication.    ,NCT00180700
HIV,Study of Immunity at the Genital Mucosa of HIV-1 Infected and Healthy Women, Current knowledge on mucosa especially genitals in women however remain inadequate especially regarding defense mechanisms and possibilities for a vaccine to induce an active immune response at mucosal front door of the most pathogens. Induction of mucosal immune response has emerged as a research priority research prophylactic vaccine.The development of strategies to prevent sexual transmission of HIV-1 depends in part on an understanding of specific and innate immune mechanisms involved in this transmission. MUCOVAC is a feasibility study of the immunological and transcriptomic analysis of cervicovaginal samples of women infected or not infected with HIV-1. We also assess tolerance samples taken by cytobrush and cervicovaginal washings efficiency and reproducibility of the sample by cytobrush and cervicovaginal lavage for transcriptomic analysis measurement of cytokines by Luminex technology quantification of IgG and IgA. In blood we will determine the phenotype of B cells and Tfh cell frequency (T follicular helper) and quantification of serum immunoglobulins and will perform a transcriptomic analysis of blood cells. Finally we will make correlations with the observed responses at the genital mucosa. This pathophysiological exploratory study will be performed in 20 women infected with HIV-1 and 20 healthy women recruited from two centers in France and will include a screening visit and two visits M0 and M1 during which mucous and blood samples will be performed. The results of the study will capitalize skills in biology mucosa using powerful tools to assess mucosal immunological parameters.    ,NCT01715103
HIV,Effects of HIV on the Development and Function of Bone Marrow Cells, This study will examine the effects of HIV on bone marrow cells. Various types of cells from bone marrow will be studied to learn which cells become infected with HIV what changes occur in the number of or growth patterns of the cells what kinds of proteins the cells make in the presence or absence of HIV and whether the cells can function normally. HIV-infected and non-infected individuals 18 years of age and older may participate in this study. Participants will undergo the following procedures:   -  Blood draw: Blood will be drawn through a needle from a hand or arm vein. About 150 milliliters (10 tablespoons) will be collected each time. No more than 450 ml (30 tablespoons) will be taken over a 6-week period.   -  Bone marrow aspirate: Bone marrow will be drawn from the hipbone. For this procedure a local anesthetic is injected in the skin over the hipbone. A small needle is put about 1/2-inch through the shell of the bone and about 3 to 4 teaspoons of marrow are drawn from the cavity into a syringe. White cells from marrow of uninfected individuals may be infected with HIV in the laboratory and grown over time for study. Alternatively uninfected cells may be used as controls to compare with cells from HIV-infected individuals. White cells from marrow of HIV-infected individuals will be grown in the laboratory and studied in comparison with cells from uninfected individuals. Or bone marrow cells may be injected into immune-deficient mice to try to develop an animal model for HIV infection. White blood cells will also be studied in the laboratory to learn how the immune system responds to HIV infection.    ,NCT00001243
HIV,Study of Patients With Strongyloides Stercoralis Infection, This study will explore faster and easier ways to detect infection with the intestinal parasite Strongyloides stercoralis and learn more about the conditions under which it causes serious disease. Ordinarily the Strongyloides helminth (type of intestinal worm) causes only few if any symptoms but in people with weakened immunity it may be very serious and even deadly. People between 5 and 80 years of age with known or suspected S. stercoralis infection or infection with another helminth such as filariasis that might cause a cross-reaction with S. stercoralis may be eligible for this study. Participants found to be infected with S. stercoralis will be treated with ivermectin thiabendazole or albendazole. In addition they will undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  Blood tests and stool samples: Samples will be collected before and after treatment to check general health status and immune function and to look for parasites in stool. Up to 50 milliliters (10 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn in adults and up to 25 ml (5 teaspoons) in children.   -  Skin tests: A test similar to those used for tuberculosis and allergies will be conducted to determine if there is sensitization to products of the parasite. Such a test might be used as a rapid method to diagnose the infection. About three drops of several different antigens (proteins) are injected into the skin of the arm. After 15 to 20 minutes the area is checked to see if a red spot has formed and if so the spot is measured.    ,NCT00001245
HIV,Studies of Blood and Reproductive Fluids in HIV-Infected and Non-HIV-Infected Persons, This study will examine the effects of HIV infection on substances produced by immune cells that increase or decrease HIV infection. HIV-infected patients and healthy normal volunteers may be eligible for this study. Participants will be required to have a yearly medical evaluation including blood tests for cell counts and chemistries a blood or urine pregnancy test for women and other laboratory tests as medically indicated or for research purposes. Participants will donate blood or reproductive fluids or both. From 20 to 150 cc (4 to 30 teaspoonfuls) of blood will be drawn from the arm using a small needle. Participants may be asked to provide blood samples on more than one occasion over the course of the study. No more than 450 cc (less than 1 pint) of blood will be drawn during any 6-week period. Males will be given a private room for semen donation; fluid from females will be collected with a cotton swab after speculum insertion. Participants may also be asked to have a buccal swab. For this procedure the inside of the cheek is gently scraped with a blunt-ended stick or brush to obtain cells (buccal mucosal cells). The tissues will be used for a variety of studies on the effects of HIV infection on factors that increase or decrease HIV infection. Some of the tissues collected for this study may also be used for the following tests:   -  Hepatitis screening Blood may be screened for different types of viral liver infections such as hepatitis A B C D E or G.   -  Genetic testing DNA from blood or cheek cells may be examined for mutations or deletions that affect chemokines cytokines and a family of enzymes called caspases. Chemokines and cytokines are important mediators of the immune response. Alterations in the genes for some of these substances influence HIV infection. Caspases regulate the process of cell death known as apoptosis. Caspase gene variations may determine the rate of cell death in HIV-infected persons and therefore the rate of HIV progression. Patients with abnormalities of any of these genes may be invited to join other studies of the role of genetic defects in HIV infection.   -  HLA testing Blood may be tested for HLA type a genetic marker of the immune system. These tests may be used to try to identify factors associated with the rate of progression of HIV disease or related conditions. Determining HLA type is necessary to be able to perform certain research studies. Some HLA types have been associated with an increased risk of certain diseases like arthritis and other rheumatologic problems.    ,NCT00001281
HIV,A Phase I/II Study of the Combination of Azidothymidine and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the Treatment of HIV-Infected Patients, This study will evaluate the long-term toxicity and obtain preliminary information about long-term efficacy of the combination of antiretroviral therapies and interleukin-2 (IL-2) a cytokine with immunomodulatory properties. Currently 73 patients have been approved to receive IL-2 at a starting dose of 18 MIU/d for 5 days. Multiple courses of IL-2 will be administered at approximately 2 month intervals. Clinical laboratory immunologic and viral parameters will be closely monitored during this time for evidence of toxicity and preliminary evidence of efficacy.    ,NCT00001282
HIV,Viral Load in Blood and Lymph Tissues of HIV-Infected Individuals, Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that lymph nodes are a major reservoir for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a major site of active virus replication in infected individuals(1-3). There is at least a 10 fold greater viral burden per given number of CD4+ T lymphocytes obtained from the lymph nodes versus the peripheral blood in the same infected individual. These data have been accumulated predominantly in individuals with progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (CDC Class A1 and A2). It is unclear at present whether this pattern holds true for all categories of HIV infected individuals. We have proposed that the seeding of lymph nodes by HIV early in the course of HIV infection and the persistent production of virus in lymph nodes throughout the course of infection are major factors in the pathogenesis of HIV in virtually all infected individuals. In addition it is likely that the selective perturbations of various T cell subsets (i.e. V-B classes of CD4+T cells) that have been observed in peripheral blood are much more dramatic in the lymph node given the greater viral burden in the lymph node compared to the peripheral blood. In order to investigate this hypothesis it is essential that we study simultaneously lymph nodes and peripheral blood from the same individuals and that we study different individuals at various stages of disease from early in the course of infection (CDC Class A) to advanced disease (CDC Class B and C). If as we suspect there is active virus replication in the lymph node early in the course of infection even at a time when there is little virus burden or active replication in the peripheral blood this would justify anti-retroviral therapy at the earliest possible time in the course of infection. In addition in certain patients who are about to initiate treatment with an anti-retroviral agent such as zidovudine or didanosine through their private physician it would be important to know whether treatment actually reduces the viral burden and virus replication in lymph nodes. The effect of therapy on viral burden and replication will be compared in the lymph node versus peripheral blood mononuclear cells and both of these parameters will be compared with the level of plasma viremia.    ,NCT00001316
HIV,Subcutaneously Administered Interleukin-2 Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients, This is a Phase I dose-escalating safety study aimed at identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for an outpatient regimen while exposing the minimum number of patients to a dose less than MTD. The anticipated accrual will be approximately 15 patients and the study will take one year to complete. Patients will receive Proleukin® (Registered Trademark) subcutaneously at their assigned dose level once per day for 5 days approximately every eight weeks for a total of 6 months. A cycle of therapy is defined as 5 days of Proleukin® (Registered Trademark) plus antiviral therapy followed by 7 weeks of antiviral therapy alone. If tolerated each patient will receive 3 cycles of therapy and following completion of three cycles will be eligible for extended treatment. IL-2 injections will be delivered by study personnel on an outpatient basis for at least the first cycle of therapy.    ,NCT00001357
HIV,Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of HIV-1 Immunogen in Children With HIV-1 Infection," This is a single dose phase I study to evaluate the safety/tolerance and the immunogenicity of HIV-1 Immunogen gp120-depleted inactivated HIV-1 preparation in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) in children with HIV-1 infection. A total of 32 children with HIV-1 infection will be enrolled in the study. Arm A of the study will enroll children who have no or moderate immune suppression at the time of study entry as defined by CDC classification and who have no history of and do not require antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral treatment given for less than 7 weeks (up to 6 weeks and 6 days) prior to entry will be considered as ""no history"" of treatment (treatment naive). Arm B will enroll children who have no or moderate immune suppression at the time of study entry as defined by CDC classification and who are on or have received antiretroviral treatment for more than 7 weeks. In order to assess the age-associated impact on the immune response rate we plan to continue to attempt to enroll infants younger than 24 months of age. Children in each arm will receive 10 units of HIV-1 Immunogen intramuscularly at 0 3 6 9 and 12 months. Antiretroviral treatment will commence once patients meet the criteria for an initiation of the treatment as defined in the protocol. All antiretroviral agents that are currently approved by FDA for clinical indications in HIV-1-infected children (pediatric labeling) are permitted in the protocol. If the child has been receiving a single agent other than ddI or has been on investigational antiretroviral agents his/her antiretroviral therapy will have to be changed to an optimal combination regimen of the approved agents at least 6 weeks prior to the enrollment.

HIV,Pharmacodynamics of Intermittent IL-2 Infusions in HIV Seropositive Patients, This study is designed as a randomized open trial of intermittent continuous infusions of Interleukin-2 in HIV seropositive patients with a CD4 cell count between 200 and 500 cells/mm(3). The goal of the study is to determine the optimal duration of each infusion and the optimal interval between infusions. Thirty-six patients will be randomized to 3 groups: Group A will be the control group with a regimen of five day infusions of IL-2 every eight weeks; Group B will receive IL-2 infusions every eight weeks however the duration of each infusion will be determined by parameters reflecting T cell proliferation with discontinuation of each infusion at a point when the response appears to be maximized; Group C will receive five day infusions of IL-2; however the interval between infusions will be determined by the response seen to the prior infusion with the goal of administering infusions while the CD4 cell count remains above baseline from the prior infusion. The dose of interleukin-2 to be used will be 9 MIU by continuous infusion daily. All patients will be evaluated at the NIH at least every 4 weeks and at that time safety labs and immune studies will be performed. In addition patients in Groups B and C will undergo a laboratory evaluation weekly at which time immune parameters including CD4 number and percent spontaneous blast transformation soluble IL-2 receptor levels and viral parameters including branched DNA assay and p24 antigen will be determined. The study duration will be approximately one year.    ,NCT00001474
HIV,Use of Combined Antiretroviral Therapy to Determine Sites of Persistent HIV Infection, This study will try to define how and where HIV infection persists in the body by determining: 1) if there are cells where HIV can live for long periods of time without being seen and destroyed by the immune system; 2) if there are sites where anti-HIV drugs cannot penetrate enough to stop new HIV replication; and 3) if HIV in certain lymph nodes can remain infectious for prolonged periods of time. It will also explore whether immune system damage caused by HIV can be repaired after new virus replication is stopped with treatment. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study which will include three groups as follows. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination blood and urine tests and possibly chest X-ray and electrocardiogram. Participants will be divided into three groups according to CD4 count levels: > 500 cells/microliter of blood; between 300 and 500 cells/microliter and < 300 cells/microliter of blood. All participants will be treated with a combination of four antiretroviral drugs: indinavir zidovudine lamivudine and nevirapine. (Exceptions to this regimen may be made in certain circumstances for patients who cannot tolerate one of the four drugs.) In addition they will undergo the following procedures: Blood tests - Blood tests will be done at screening and at study entry to evaluate the patient's health status and measure CD4 T cell count and plasma HIV levels; at the beginning of treatment to look for drug-related side effects; and during the course of the study to evaluate drug effectiveness in inhibiting HIV replication; CD4 T cell levels and function. Lymph node biopsy - Lymph node biopsies are done under local anesthesia. A small incision is made the node is removed and the incision is closed with stitches. Up to two nodes may be removed during each procedure. Patients with CD4 counts greater than 500 cells/microliter of blood and those with counts less than 300 cells/microliter will have three lymph node biopsies in order to 1) assess the effectiveness of therapy in inhibiting HIV replication in the nodes (the major site of replication); 2) determine how long HIV-infected cells may persist in the nodes after new replication is stopped by therapy; and 3) determine if immune damage caused by HIV can be repaired when virus replication is stopped. Lymph node biopsy in patients with counts between 300 and 500 cells/microliter of blood is required only at baseline although follow-up biopsies are encouraged. Leukapheresis - In this procedure whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a cell separator machine where the white cells are removed and collected. The rest of the blood is returned to the body either through the same needle used to draw the blood or through a second needle placed in the other arm. The collected white cells are used for special studies of the level and function of T cells before and after drug treatment. Patients with CD4 counts > 500 cells/microliter and < 300 cells/microliter will undergo leukapheresis up to four times - at study entry and about 2 6 and 12 months after starting antiretroviral therapy. Patients with CD4 counts between 300 and 500 cells/microliter will have this procedure either at study entry and 6 and 12 weeks after initiation therapy or on the same schedule as the other patients.    ,NCT00001644
HIV,Use of Bromodeoxyuridine to Study White Blood Cell Replication and Survival in HIV-Infected Patients, This study will examine how quickly white blood cells called CD4 lymphocytes reproduce and how long they live in people infected with HIV. It will do this using bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU) a compound that is structurally similar to thymidine one of the building blocks of DNA. BrDU gets incorporated into DNA instead of thymidine but it can only get into cells that are replicating. Therefore measuring the proportion of cells with BrDU indicates how many cells are replicating. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination chest X-ray electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood tests. Participants will be given an infusion of BrDU through a catheter (thin plastic tube) placed in an arm vein. Blood will be drawn up to 4 times in the first 24 hours after the infusion. Additional samples will then be collected as often as daily for the first week twice a week for the next 3 weeks and then weekly to monthly for up to 1 year. Some patients may undergo a tissue biopsy (removal of a small tissue sample from a lymph node tonsil or colon) or computed tomography (CT) scans of the thymus (a small gland between the lungs that manufactures lymphocytes. Some patients will have a second infusion in order to examine changes in the rate of CD4 replication over time or following potent antiretroviral therapy. Patients will be followed in the clinic periodically for the first year and then will be seen in the clinic or contacted by telephone once a year for 4 more years. The results of this study may provide a better understanding of how HIV causes disease and how therapy affects the immune system.    ,NCT00001650
HIV,Use of Labeled Glucose to Study Lymphocyte Replication and Survival in HIV-Infected Patients, This study will examine how quickly white blood cells called CD4 lymphocytes replicate (divide) and how long they live in both HIV-infected and non-infected people by measuring how quickly the genetic material (DNA) of cells is replicated. To do this participants will receive infusions of glucose a non-radioactive form of a type of sugar. Cells normally use glucose to make various products needed for cell growth and replication including cell DNA. Measuring how much glucose cells incorporate into their DNA can provide important information about cell replication. This rate of incorporation will be examined and compared in HIV-infected people and in healthy normal volunteers. HIV-infected patients and non-infected healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination chest X-ray electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood tests. Participants will be given a continuous infusion of glucose at a dose of up to 60 grams (about 2 ounces) per day for up to 5 days. The glucose will be delivered through a catheter (thin plastic tube) placed in an arm vein. Blood samples will be collected as often as daily in the first week following the infusion and then from twice a week to once a month for up to 4 years. Alternatively patients may undergo leukapheresis a procedure for collecting quantities of lymphocytes up to 10 times during the first month after the infusion and possibly later as well but no more often than once every 2 weeks. For this procedure whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the body either through the same needle or through a second needle in the other arm. Participants may be asked to receive up to four glucose infusions. There will be at least a 2-week interval between infusions. Participants who have more than three leukapheresis procedures within 3 weeks will have at least 6 weeks between infusions. Participants will be followed periodically in the outpatient clinic for evaluation and tests. This study may provide a better understanding of how HIV causes disease and progressive weakening of the immune system and how therapies affect immunity.    ,NCT00001651
HIV,A Pilot Study of the Immunologic Reconstitution in HIV-1 Infected Children Receiving Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy With Combination Ritonavir Nevirapine and Stavudine, This is a pilot study to evaluate the ability of highly active antiretroviral therapy administered to children with HIV-1 infection to effect immunoreconstitution in children with HIV-1 infection. In addition this study will determine the safety of combination therapy with ritonavir nevirapine and stavudine (d4T) as well as the anti-HIV activity of combination therapy with ritonavir nevirapine and stavudine. A total of 25 HIV-1 infected children will be studied including both moderately and severely immunocompromised individuals. The children will be treated with ritonavir nevirapine and stavudine or with predefined drug substitutions in the case of intolerance. Immunoreconstitution defined as the repopulation of naive T cells will be studied by determining the presence and extent of production of new naive (thymic derived) CD4+ T cells and their T cell receptor repertoire. Drug pharmacokinetic profiles in this regimen will be examined.    ,NCT00001688
HIV,Continued Antiretroviral Therapy With Abacavir Amprenavir and Efavirenz, This study will continue to treat and collect safety and efficacy data on patients who participated in Glaxo-Wellcome's multi-center study on combination therapy with abacavir amprenavir and efavirenz (A Phase II Study Evaluating the Safety and Antiviral Activity of Combination Therapy with 1592U89 141W94 and DMP 266 (Sustiva) in HIV-1 Infected Subjects with Detectable [greater than 400 Copies/mL] HIV-1 Plasma RNA Despite Treatment with a Protease Inhibitor-Containing Regimen). HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older who participated in the above study at the NIH site may be eligible for the current study. Participants will be followed every 3 months with a general health evaluation and laboratory tests. This is a NIH study and information will not be provided to Glaxo Wellcome    ,NCT00001758
HIV,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Face and Bones, This study will examine risk factors for facial wasting and avascular necrosis (AVN a type of damage to the hip and other bones) in HIV-infected patients. The prevalence and natural history of AVN are also being evaluated. This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify and monitor these conditions in patients with and without diagnosed AVN and to identify risk factors. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. HIV-infected children 4 years and older who can tolerate magnetic resonance imaging without sedation may also participate. Candidates may be screened for participation with a medical history physical examination blood and urine tests and possibly an electrocardiogram. Volunteers will provide a medical history and may have a brief physical examination. The study is currently closed to normal volunteers. HIV-infected patients will have a MRI scan of the hip bone and possibly other bones. Before the scan they will provide a medical history by interview or questionnaire and have a physical examination. Those with diagnosed AVN will also have blood drawn to help identify potential risk factors for AVN. For the MRI the patient lies flat on a stretcher that is moved into a cylindrical machine with a strong magnetic field. Earplugs are worn to muffle thumping sounds produced by radio waves that form the images. Patients can speak with a staff member via an intercom system at all times during the procedure. Repeat MRI studies will be requested at approximately 3- to 12-month intervals for up to 5 years to see if changes occur with time. If medically indicated additional diagnostic studies may be done to obtain information needed for appropriate medical care. Blood will be drawn periodically to examine immune parameters and viral blood levels. Patients with AVN may have periodic consultations with the rehabilitation medicine service and orthopedic surgeons.    ,NCT00001762
HIV,Drug Interactions Among Anti-HIV Agents, This study examined the interactions of various drugs used to treat HIV infection in order to design larger studies of possible combinations for people who continue to have high viral levels despite combination therapy. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older who have a viral load of at least 500 copies/mL; who have received 20 weeks of protease inhibitor therapy with the same protease inhibitors in combination therapy for the last 12 weeks; and who have never been treated with abacavir amprenavir or efavirenz were enrolled. All patients will receive 600 milligrams a day of efavirenz (a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor); 300 mg twice daily of abacavir (a nucleoside analog); and 1200 mg twice a day of amprenavir (a protease inhibitor). In addition to these drugs six patients will receive 500 mg twice a day of ritonavir (a protease inhibitor); six patients will receive 200 mg twice a day of ritonavir; and 10 will receive 1250 mg twice a day of nelfinavir (a protease inhibitor). Patients in the two ritonavir groups (500-mg and 200-mg dose groups) took abacavir and amprenavir for one week and then come to the clinic for blood tests to measure drug levels before taking their morning pills and at 1/2 1 2 4 8 and 12 hours after taking the medicines. They will then add ritonavir to their treatment regimen. After one week they will return for blood tests as before. They will then add efavirenz to their regimen and had bloods drawn again after another 1 or 2 weeks. Patients in the nelfinavir group took abacavir amprenavir and nelfinavir for one week and then have blood sampling as described above for the ritonavir group. They will then add efavirenz to the regimen and repeat the blood tests again after another 1 or 2 weeks. Participants are being seen in the clinic for follow-up only if they wish to continue to participate and if the regimen appears to offer clinical benefit.    ,NCT00001766
HIV,Combination Drug Treatment of Pediatric HIV Infection, This study will test the safety and effectiveness of hydroxyurea an anti-cancer drug given together with the anti-HIV drugs didanosine stavudine and efavirenz for treating children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Some studies have found that hydroxyurea may help certain anti-HIV drugs to work better and that the virus does not become resistant to it as it does other drugs. This study will also examine how hydroxyurea affects the body's immune system and virus levels. Patients 3 through 21 years old with HIV infection may be eligible for this 52-week study. They will be screened for eligibility with a thorough physical examination including chest X-ray electrocardiogram and echocardiogram head CT scan eye examination and blood tests. All patients in the study will take didanosine twice a day stavudine twice a day and efavirenz once a day. All patients will also take hydroxyurea twice a day but some will take a low dose of the drug while others will take a high dose. Within each of these two groups (high and low dose) some patients will start taking hydroxyurea the same day they begin the anti-HIV drugs; others will not start hydroxyurea until after they have taken the anti-HIV drugs for 5 weeks. Patients will have a physical examination every 3 weeks until week 12 then every 4 weeks until week 24 and then every 8 weeks until the end of the study. Blood tests to measure virus levels will be done every other day for the first 7 days and periodically after that. For the first 8 weeks after starting hydroxyurea blood tests will be done weekly. An eye examination chest X-ray electrocardiogram and CT scans of the head will be done about every 6 months.    ,NCT00001818
HIV,Observation of HIV-Infected Children Receiving Protease Inhibitor and Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor, This study will continue to follow children who participated in an earlier National Cancer Institute trial of HIV treatment with a protease inhibitor. Children in this study will receive a combination of at least three drugs that include at least one protease inhibitor and one reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The study will examine to what extent these drugs can restore immune function in HIV-infected children and over what length of time. It will look at changes in the amounts of virus and the specific types of immune cells in the body over the 96-week trial period. It will also examine patients' immune system response to influenza and tetanus vaccinations. The children will either continue to receive the anti-HIV drugs they have been taking or their medicines will be changed to a different combination of protease inhibitor and reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Before and during the study patients will undergo various tests including a physical examination blood tests and chest X ray immune response tests CT scan eye examination electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. A procedure called apheresis may be done to collect white blood cells. In this procedure whole blood is drawn similar to donating blood the white cells are separated out by a machine and the red cells are returned to the body.    ,NCT00001826
HIV,Immune and Viral Status of HIV-Infected Patients After Stopping Combination Antiretroviral Therapy, This study will examine the effects of increases in HIV blood levels on the immune system. A better understanding of how HIV alters the immune response may lead to development of effective immune-based therapies against the virus. Patients 18 years of age or older with HIV-1 infection who have been receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may be eligible for this study. In order to study the effect of increased levels of virus on the immune system therapy will be stopped in these patients temporarily. Therefore only patients who have an appropriate level of understanding of the potential benefits of therapy and the risks of stopping treatment will be considered for enrollment. Pregnant women may not participate and women of childbearing potential must agree not to become pregnant during the study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical exam blood and urine tests and possibly a chest X-ray and electrocardiogram. Upon entering the study participants will have blood tests to measure the amount of virus in the blood CD4+ T cell counts side effects of the medications and how the patient s immune system responds to HIV in the test tube. White cells will be collected through leukapheresis. In this procedure a needle is placed in an arm vein and blood flows from the vein through a tube (catheter) into a cell separator machine where the white cells are separated from the rest of the blood by a spinning process. Some of the white cells are collected by the machine and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through a second needle placed in the other arm. Patients will then have a physical examination and blood tests every 1 to 2 weeks and will be managed according to their viral load and CD4 cell counts as follows: Viral Load   -  If viral blood levels remain less than 5000 copies per milliliter no medical intervention is planned.   -  If viral blood levels rise to 5000 copies per ml or higher patients will undergo a second leukapheresis and re-start antiretroviral therapy. They will be monitored at least monthly until viral load returns to pre-study levels. CD4 Count   -  If the CD4 count rises or remains at pre-study levels no intervention is planned.   -  If the CD4 count decreases by 10 to 25 percent of pre-study levels the counts will be monitored every 2 weeks at least 3 times and then monthly.   -  If the CD4 count decreases by 25 percent or more of pre-study values antiretroviral therapy will be re-started and counts will be monitored until they return to pre-study levels. If viral and CD4 levels do not return to pre-study levels promptly patients will continue to be monitored and will be advised about possible treatment changes. Alternatively patients whose viral and CD4 levels are similar to or better than pre-study values may be offered laboratory testing every 3 months for at least 1 year if there is a scientific reason to continue studying the patient s immune system. Patients may be asked to undergo additional leukapheresis in the future or another interruption of therapy in the future if it is felt safe to do so.    ,NCT00001899
HIV,A Study of Health-Related Quality of Life in HIV-Infected Patients Undergoing Structured Treatment Interruptions of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy," This study will examine and compare the health-related quality of life and degree of symptom discomfort in two groups of patients receiving intensive drug therapy for HIV infection. One group will receive continuous treatment over the entire 88-week study period; the other will have interruptions in therapy over the same time period. Patients enrolled in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's trial ""Immunologic and Virologic Studies of Intermittent versus Continuous HAART [highly active antiretroviral therapy] in the Treatment of HIV Disease"" may participate in this study. At periodic intervals for a total of 7 times during the 88-week trial this companion study will require participants in both the interrupted and the continuous therapy groups to complete the following two questionnaires:   1. MOS-HIV Health Survey - The patient provides a self-assessment of his or her physical and emotional well being. Survey questions are related to the ability to perform work and daily living activities mood and state of mind limitations on social activities ability to concentrate energy level pain level general quality of life etc.   2. Symptom Distress Scale - The patient rates the degree of symptom distress by ranking from 1 to 5 his or her agreement with statements about various physical and emotional factors including appetite nausea breathing cough pain insomnia fatigue bowel problems concentration appearance and outlook. Understanding the impact of HIV treatments on health-related quality of life and symptom distress may provide information helpful in evaluating new treatment approaches.    ",NCT00001948
HIV,Intermittent Versus Continuous Medication in the Treatment of HIV, Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful in suppressing plasma HIV RNA levels in infected patients it has not resulted in eradication of virus. It is now clear that virus replication persists despite undetectable plasma viremia in individuals receiving HAART. In this regard withdrawing HAART even after prolonged periods of virus suppression leads to an almost universal rapid rebound of plasma viremia. It is also now clear that prolonged continuous HAART carries a risk of significant toxicity and side effects. These recent observations may argue for a different approach to HAART with the goals of: 1) durable suppression of virus replication without an attempt at eradication and 2) minimization of toxicity and side effects and improvement in patient life-style. Therefore we propose to study the virologic and immunologic effects of intermittent versus continuous HAART in HIV-infected individuals as a possible means to achieve these goals. The primary protocol Cohort 1 will be a randomized controlled study of 35 individuals receiving continuous HAART and 35 individuals receiving intermittent HAART with intervals of one month off therapy followed by two months on therapy. A second cohort of 10 individuals will serve as a pilot of 2 arms of 5 patients each to evaluate the potential of shorter on-off cycles to maintain suppression of plasma virus and boost HIV-specific immune responses. An extension of Cohort 2 will add 5 patients to the 7 days on/7 days off HAART arm with modified exclusion criteria and procedure schedule. We will analyze CD4+ T-cell counts viral load incidence of toxicity and side effects HIV-specific immune responses and viral resistance to therapy and characterize the virus during rebound plasma viremia.    ,NCT00001967
HIV,Pharmacokinetics of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1 Infected Pregnant Women, This study will determine if blood levels of anti-HIV drugs in pregnant women change at different stages of pregnancy and if these changes require dosage adjustments in order to maintain adequate drug levels during pregnancy. Anti-HIV medications are recommended for HIV-infected women during pregnancy not only to treat their infection but also to reduce the chance of passing the virus to the baby during pregnancy. Changes in the body that occur during pregnancy may affect how the body uses and eliminates these drugs reducing their levels during pregnancy. Pregnant women 18 years of age or older who are infected with HIV may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a medical history and physical examination pregnancy test and blood tests. Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center once every 6 to 12 weeks until around their 34th week (8 months) of pregnancy and then again at least 1 month after the birth of the baby to have blood drawn. A catheter (thin plastic tube) will be placed in a vein to avoid multiple needle sticks for blood sampling during the day. The first sample will be collected before the patient takes the morning doses of anti-HIV medicines and additional samples will be drawn at 1 2 4 8 and 12 hours after taking the medication. A urine sample will also be collected at each visit.    ,NCT00006320
HIV,Study of Tests to Evaluate Effectiveness of Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to determine how laboratory tests called genotyping and phenotyping assess the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection. Some HIV-infected patients have measurable levels of virus in their blood even though they are taking combination drug therapy-including didanosine stavudine or efavirenz-against HIV. Genotyping and phenotyping can be used to test for resistance to a specific drug thereby providing information that can help doctors decide on optimal drug treatment for a given patient. Genotyping identifies mutations or changes the virus undergoes that allow it to continue to grow despite drug treatment. Phenotyping involves growing the virus in test tubes with different amounts of drug and then calculating how much drug is required to stop its growth. Patients 18 years of age and older with HIV infection and viral levels between 5000 and 100000 copies per milliliter of blood who have been taking antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a urine test and various blood tests including genotyping and phenotyping. Participants will have a series of tests to determine whether or not a drug is active against HIV. This involves temporarily stopping the drug under study (i.e. either efavirenz or didanosine or stavudine). The study procedure is as follows:   1. Patients will have six blood tests over 10 days to measure viral load while on all current anti-HIV medications. On one of those days two blood tests will be done to measure levels of didanosine or stavudine. Efavirenz will also be measured if this drug is to be stopped.   2. The patient will temporarily stop the drug under while continuing to take the other drugs. (Efavirenz will be stopped for 3 weeks; stavudine and didanosine will be stopped for 2 weeks.) Seven blood tests will be done at the following intervals to measure viral load: For patients who stop efavirenz blood will be drawn on days 13 18 20 22 2428 and 30. (Day 0 is the first day of the study.) Patients who stop stavudine or didanosine will have blood drawn on days 11 13 15 17 19 22 and 24. Repeat genotype and phenotype testing will also be done during this time and a CD4 count (measurement of a certain type of white blood cell) will be done at the end of this 2- or 3-week period.   3. The drug that was stopped will be restarted and viral load tests will be repeated. For pati...    ,NCT00006494
HIV,Capravirine to Treat Children With HIV Infection," This study will test the safety side effects and anti-HIV activity of different doses of capravirine in children and adolescents with HIV infection. Capravirine belongs to a class of drugs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) which prevent the virus from replicating (making more copies of itself). Other NNRTIs are nevirapine delavirdine and efavirenz. HIV-infected children between the ages of 4 months and 21 years may be eligible for this study if they: 1) have received less than 6 weeks of treatment with antiretroviral drugs; 2) have not benefited from antiretroviral therapy after 12 weeks of treatment; 3) cannot continue antiretroviral treatment because of harmful side effects. For the first week of the study participants will have a 1-week ""washout period"" in which they will receive no anti-HIV therapy. During this time they will have physical eye and neuropsychologic examinations blood and urine tests echocardiogram electrocardiogram (EKG) chest X-ray head CT scan and skin tests. These physical exams and tests will be repeated throughout the study to determine changes in health. After the washout period patients will take capravirine once a day in the morning for 6 days. After each dose a small amount of blood will be drawn at 8 different times over 12 hours to measure the activity of the drug and HIV blood levels. A heparin lock will be placed in the vein to avoid multiple needlesticks. After the 6 days of capravirine there will be another washout period this time for 21 days. During this time doctors will determine the optimum combination therapy for the individual patient. After the second washout patients will begin combination therapy with capravirine plus at least two other anti-HIV medicines. (These may include a reverse transcriptase inhibitor such as zidovudine didanosine lamuvidine zalcitabine or stavudine and maybe one or more protease inhibitors such as ritonavir nelfinavir saquinavir indinavir or amprenavir.) For the first week patients will have a daily blood test to determine HIV blood levels. Afterwards treatment will continue on an outpatient basis with clinic visits every 4 to 8 weeks for physical exams lab tests and other procedures as required. The study will last approximately 48 weeks. Patients who benefit from capravirine therapy may be able to continue to receive the drug from the drug company sponsor or as part of another study or the protocol for this study may be amended to lengthen the treatment period.

HIV,Analysis of HIV Genetic Variation in Patients Before Beginning Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy, The purpose of this study is to gain knowledge about why drug therapy sometimes stops working in people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This occurs in 30 to 40% of patients treated with powerful antiretroviral drugs. The study will examine how the virus becomes resistant to drug treatment through mutations (changes) and how different mutations produce new variants that are resistant to more than one drug. HIV-infected patients 18 years and older who have not been treated with antiretroviral medications and who have a relatively stable amount of virus in their blood (viral load) may be eligible for this study. Pregnant or breastfeeding women may not participate. Candidates will be screened with blood tests to determine viral load and to study the genetics of the virus. Participants will be hospitalized at the NIH Clinical Center for 10 days for daily blood sampling. (In exceptional circumstances the sampling may be done on an outpatient basis.) After discharge patients will be followed by weekly visits for blood tests for a total of 120 days. When antiretroviral treatment begins the patient may do one of the following:   1. Continue on this study with antiretroviral treatment. Therapy will consist of D4T 3TC and efavirenz. Other drugs may be substituted for any of these that cannot be tolerated. HIV protease inhibitors will not be included in the regimen.   2. Complete participation in this study and if eligible enroll in another NIH protocol (AVBIO).   3. Begin standard antiretroviral therapy with a private physician. Patients for whom treatment is not yet recommended or who choose not to be treated may continue to be monitored with blood tests for a total of 18 months. (Patients who leave the study after this time may re-join when they decide to start treatment.) Participants may also undergo the following optional procedures to study the genetic variation of HIV: lymph node biopsy spinal tap and semen donation or female genital washing to collect secretion samples. Sexual partners or needle-sharing partners of study patients are invited to enroll in this study to provide blood samples at the time the patient enrolls and at two intervals after any needle sharing or unsafe sex event they may report to NIH. Partners may also donate genital secretions or semen and a lymph node or spinal fluid sample. Information from this study may help in the development of new drug treatments that will be effective in controlling HIV infection when other treatments no longer work.    ,NCT00009256
HIV,The Effect of Milk Thistle on the Pharmacokinetics of Indinavir, Complementary and alternative medicines are widely used in the HIV-infected population. Recent data have shown serious drug interactions between certain complementary medicines and protease inhibitors. Silymarin (Milk thistle) is a commonly used dietary supplement in HIV-infected patients for treatment of hepatitis or as a hepato-protectant. Data are available suggesting that it may alter cytochrome P4503A4-mediated drug metabolism. To evaluate the effect of milk thistle on the protease inhibitor indinavir (IDV) ten healthy subjects will receive IDV (Crixivan) alone and in combination with an over-the-counter silymarin preparation. IDV will initially be administered alone at a dose of 800 mg Q8H for four doses and serial samples will be collected for determination of IDV pharmacokinetics after the morning dose on day 2. Subjects will then initiate therapy will milk thistle using a standardized formulation and dose for three weeks after which subjects will then again take 4 doses of IDV and have serial samples collected for IDV plasma concentrations. There will then be a 11-day washout period with no drugs after which IDV will again be given for 4 doses and samples will be collected evaluate the offset of the effects of milk thistle. To examine the effect of milk thistle on other CYP450 pathways subjects will receive a single dose of caffeine and dextromethorphan and have urine collected before and after milk thistle and after the washout period. Indinavir caffeine and dextromethorphan concentrations in plasma or urine will be determined using validated HPLC methods. Steady-state noncompartmental parameters of indinavir in the presence and absence of milk thistle will be determined. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be compared using ANOVA that will include factors for a period effect and a treatment effect. Statistical analyses will include calculation of the mean ratio of the AUC in the treatment phases compared to IDV alone and determination of 95% confidence intervals. This study will help define the drug interaction potential of complementary and alternative therapies in HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT00011635
HIV,A Medication Adherence Intervention for HIV Infected Veterans, It is estimated that the VHA is caring for nearly 40 percent of all HIV-infected veterans. To benefit from recent improvements in anti-HIV therapy patients need to take their medications consistently.    ,NCT00013065
HIV,Interleukin-2 Plus Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-Infected Patients With Low CD4+ Counts (SILCAAT Study), This study will examine whether interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus antiretroviral therapy (ART) slows HIV disease progression in patients with low CD4+ T cell counts compared with patients taking ART alone. CD4+ T cells are a subset of lymphocytes-white blood cells that are part of the body's immune system. IL-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. Given in intermittent cycles IL-2 can raise CD4+ T cell counts in some HIV-infected patients taking antiretroviral drugs. This study will examine whether the increase in CD4+ T cells lowers the risk of AIDS-related illnesses and death. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with a viral load under 10000 copies per milliliter and a CD4+ T cell count between 50 and 299 cells per cubic millimeter who are taking antiretroviral therapy and who have not previously received IL-2 therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests. Participation in the study will be from 4.5 to 6 years depending on what point in the duration of the study the individual patient is enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive IL-2 plus ART or ART alone. All participants will be advised individually about the best ART regimen for them. Patients in the IL-2 treatment group will be taught how to self-inject IL-2 under the skin (similar to insulin injections). They will inject IL-2 twice a day for 5 days every 8 weeks for the first year (until week 49 of the study). From week 49 on they may receive 5-day cycles of IL-2 every 4 months when needed to maintain CD4+ T cell count elevations. An extra cycle may be given 2 months after the week 49 follow-up visit (see follow-up schedule below) depending on their CD4+ T cell count. Patients whose cell counts have not increased after 12 to 16 months of IL-2 treatment will discuss with the doctor the possibility of stopping IL-2. Those who do stop IL-2 treatment will be asked to remain in the study for follow-up evaluations. All patients will be followed in the clinic every 2 months for the first year of the study (weeks 1 9 17 25 33 41 and 49) and every 4 months during years 2-6 for a brief history and physical exam urine and blood tests return of diary cards (record of drug side effects) and medication review. During the visits from the second year on patients will also be asked about their ability to do certain ordinary tasks such as taking care of themselves; ...    ,NCT00013611
HIV,HIV Maintenance Therapy With T-20 During HAART Interruption, This study will evaluate whether a drug called T-20 can slow or prevent a rapid return of HIV in the blood when HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) is stopped temporarily. HAART is a multi-dose regimen that is very effective in suppressing HIV and perhaps slowing or halting progression of the viral infection towards AIDS. However this treatment is not problem-oriented. It cannot completely rid the body of virus and long-term therapy carries a risk of toxicity (harmful side effects). Moreover the treatment is difficult to adhere to because of the many pills and capsules that must be taken daily. When patients stop taking HAART their viral levels climb again. This study will see if T-20 can prolong the time it takes for HIV blood levels to rise in patients who stop HAART temporarily. The results may provide insight into possible new HAART-sparing treatments. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older who have received HAART for at least 1 month may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination blood and urine tests and possibly a chest X-ray and electrocardiogram (EKG). Participants will receive either 100 Mg. of T-20 twice a day or 200 Mg. once a day injected under the skin and their normal HAART regimen for 3 days. (Patients or a caregiver will be taught how to give the T-20 injections.) On the fourth day HAART will be stopped and all patients will receive 100 Mg. of T-20 twice a day for 6 weeks. Blood will be drawn weekly from the second to the sixth week after stopping HAART to check viral levels and CD4+ T cell counts. At the end of the 6 weeks T-20 will be stopped and HAART will be restarted. Patients will then be evaluated once a month until their viral level is less than 50. The final clinic visit will be one month after this time. In addition to blood draws patients will undergo leukapheresis before beginning T-20 and possibly again when they restart HAART and at the end of the study. For this procedure whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm vein similar to donating blood. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are then removed and the red cells platelets and plasma are returned to the body either through the same needle used to draw the blood or through a second needle placed in the other arm. The white cells are used to study T cell function and levels and to detect hidden virus.    ,NCT00013884
HIV,Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate to Treat Pediatric HIV, This study will test the safety side effects and antiviral activity of different doses of tenofovir DF in children and adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Tenofovir DF belongs to a group of drugs called nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors. These drugs prevent the virus from replicating (making more copies of itself). HIV becomes resistant to many drugs used to fight the virus and these drugs become ineffective. In laboratory tests tenofovir DF has remained effective against HIV longer than other anti-HIV medicines and when resistance does develop the virus may still be sensitive to other drugs. HIV-infected children between the ages of 4 and 18 years who weigh at least 10 kg (22 pounds) may be eligible for this study. They must be able to receive antiretroviral therapy and have completed at least two previous antiretroviral courses of treatment without benefit. Upon entering the study participants will have physical eye and neuropsychiatric examinations blood tests including tests to determine what anti-HIV drugs the patient is resistant to an echocardiogram (echo) electrocardiogram (EKG) chest X-ray head CT scan skin tests and special tests to examine the bones. These physical exams and tests will be repeated throughout the study to determine changes in health. Participants will continue their current anti-HIV therapy for 2 weeks and then stop all medicines for a 1-week 'washout' period. After the washout period patients will begin taking tenofovir DF. For the first 2 days on the drug a small blood sample (1/2 teaspoon) will be collected 11 times over a 48-hour period through. A heparin lock (a tube kept in place in a vein) may be put in place to avoid multiple needle sticks. Blood samples will be collected for another 4 days to measure how well tenofovir DF alone works against HIV before other drugs are added to the treatment regimen. After these first 6 days at least two other anti-HIV drugs will be added. They will be selected based on the results of the earlier blood tests for resistance and on the child's medication history. After 3 days of combination therapy patients will continue therapy on an outpatient basis. They will be seen in the clinic every 4 weeks at the start of the study and then every 12 weeks for physical exams lab tests and other procedures as needed. The study will last approximately 48 weeks. Patients who benefit from therapy may be able to continue to receive tenofovir DF from the drug company sponsor or as part of another study or the protocol for this study may be amended to lengthen the treatment period.    ,NCT00024986
HIV,Intermittent vs. Continuous HAART to Treat Chronic HIV Infection, This study will evaluate the effects of intermittent short cycles of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) for treating HIV infection. HAART is a multi-drug regimen that is very effective in suppressing HIV and perhaps slowing or halting progression to AIDS. However the treatment has significant drawbacks: it cannot completely rid the body of virus; long-term therapy carries a risk of toxicity (harmful side effects); and the regimen is difficult to comply with because many pills and capsules must be taken daily. When patients stop taking HAART their HIV levels climb again. This study will see if giving HAART in short cycles of 7 days on 7 days off can keep viral levels low while maintaining CD4+ T cell counts. HIV-infected people age 18 or older who are receiving HAART and have a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml and a CD4+ T cell count of at least 175 cells/mm3 may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination blood and urine tests and possibly a chest X-ray and electrocardiogram. Women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test. Participants will be randomly assigned to either continue their current medication regimen or to take HAART in intermittent cycles of 7 days off 7 days on. Patients will continue treatment for 72 weeks or until viral levels increase or CD4+ T cell counts decline to a level of concern. Upon entering the study patients will have blood tests to monitor the amount of virus in the blood CD4+ T cell count viral resistance to HAART medications side effects of the drug and immune response to HIV in the test tube. They will have clinic visits for a history physical examination and blood draws every month for 12 months. At that time depending on T cell counts and viral load the number of visits may be reduced but never less frequently than every other month. Patients will also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure for collecting quantities of white blood cells-every 3 to 4 months while on the study. For this procedure whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein (similar to donating blood). The blood is circulated through a cell separator where the white cells are removed and the rest of the blood (plasma red cells and platelets) is returned through the same needle or through a second one in the other arm. The collected white cells are used for special studies on the level and function of T cells and to detect hidden virus.    ,NCT00025909
HIV,Influenza Vaccine in HIV Infection: Immune Response and Effect on Viral Load, This 2-part study will examine 1) the immune response to influenza (flu) vaccine in HIV-infected patients and 2) the effect of flu vaccine on HIV viral loads. Earlier studies have shown that people with HIV infection do not respond as well to flu vaccine as healthy subjects; that is they don't make as many antibodies in response to the vaccine. Also studies done before the use of HAART (highly active antiretroviral treatment) have shown that HIV levels increase for a period of time after flu vaccination. One small study showed a small brief increase in HIV even in patients taking HAART. The current trial will examine whether the flu vaccine does in fact cause an elevation in viral load and whether this increase is harmful or indicates a better response to the vaccine. HIV-infected patients and healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for part1of this study. (Healthy volunteers will serve as control subjects to make sure the flu vaccine stimulates production of enough antibody to protect against the flu). Part 2 will include only HIV-infected patients with fewer than 50 copies per milliliter of HIV. Patients in both parts of the study must have been receiving HAART (consisting of at least two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a protease inhibitor) for at least 3 months before enrollment in the study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and blood tests including HLA testing (a genetic test of immune system markers). Women who are able to have children will have a pregnancy test. Pregnant women are excluded from the study. Participants will undergo the following procedures:   -  Part 1 - Immune Response to Flu Vaccine In the first of two visits participants will have blood drawn for flu antibody levels before vaccination and in HIV-infected patients measures of T cell count and viral load. They will then receive the flu vaccine. Blood will be drawn at a second visit 28 days later for the same tests.   -  Part 2 - Effect of Flu Vaccine on Viral Levels Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the flu vaccine either at the beginning of their enrollment in the study (immediate) or 3 weeks after enrollment (deferred). Those in the immediate group receive the flu vaccine on the first day (day 0) and have blood drawn on days 0 3 7 10 14 17 21 24 28 31 35 38 and 42.

HIV,Correlation of HIV Levels With Clinical and Immunologic Outcome in Children Treated With Didanosine, Recent studies have shown that patients receiving state-of-the-art treatment for HIV infection (highly active antiretroviral therapy or HAART) show discordant responses to therapy-that is they improve both clinically and immunologically (increased CD4 immune cell counts) but their levels of HIV in the blood do not drop. This study will examine blood samples taken from HIV-infected children treated with 2'3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine or ddI) in an earlier NCI study to determine if these patients had similar discordant responses to therapy. If so the study will also examine how these factors may be predictive of disease progression and survival. Investigators will measure HIV levels in blood specimens from children previously enrolled in NCI protocol 88-C-0129. The measurements will be done in specimens drawn before initiation of treatment with ddI and at various times during the course of treatment. The viral responses to therapy will then be correlated with short- and long-term clinical and immunologic outcomes. In addition researchers will examine these patients' blood samples for additional factors recently discovered to potentially influence disease progression. They include selenium levels and certain genetic factors. A better understanding of discordant responses to therapy will help physicians determine the best treatment option in situations where therapy results do not show uniform benefit. This protocol involves the scientific examination of laboratory specimens only and is not a clinical study open to patient enrollment.    ,NCT00026676
HIV,Long-Term Survival With HIV: Psychological and Behavioral Factors Associated With the Transition From Adolescence to Young Adulthood, This study will examine the emotional and behavioral aspects of long-term survival of HIV/AIDS among adolescents and young adults with HIV infection. HIV-infected individuals between 13 and 23 years of age may be eligible for this study. They must be aware of their HIV diagnosis have been infected for at least 13 years and have been on an active NIH protocol during the past 5 years. In addition to the usual stresses of growing up children with HIV infection may have spent much of their time in hospitals and may have lost parents friends and other loved ones. This study will explore psychological aspects of growing up with HIV including self esteem possible risk behaviors how disclosure to others changes over time the commonness of anxiety and depression and the impact that losses have had on the adolescents' emotional health. To gather this information participants will be interviewed and asked to fill out a set of forms. Caregivers will also fill out forms. Patients who are not currently on an active NIH protocol will have the option of having a physical examination and routine blood work. The results will be sent to their home care provider.    ,NCT00026806

HIV,Screening HIV-Infected Patients for Vaccine Studies, This screening study will evaluate potential study volunteers with HIV infection to see if they are suitable candidates for trials of experimental vaccines against HIV (therapeutic) and against other infections (preventive).   -  Preventive vaccines against other infections. Preventive vaccines prevent a person from getting a disease. Preventive vaccines have been developed for many diseases including for example whooping cough measles mumps influenza and hepatitis B. Some preventive vaccines may also prevent a disease from taking hold if given immediately after infection such as vaccines for rabies smallpox and hepatitis.   -  Therapeutic vaccines against HIV. Therapeutic vaccines are intended to treat someone who has already been infected with the goal of controlling the disease or preventing it from causing severe illness. As yet there are no therapeutic vaccines for any diseases.   -  Vaccines against other infections. Vaccines to prevent other infections besides HIV may need to be tested separately in people with HIV infection because the immune system works differently when HIV infection is present. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this screening study. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding may not participate. Participants will be screened with the following:   -  A health history including questions about sexual activity and drug use;   -  Physical examination including blood and urine tests;   -  HIV testing to confirm HIV infection;   -  Pregnancy test for premenopausal women;   -  PPD test for tuberculosis for those who have not been tested in the previous 6 months. Candidates who meet the requirements for investigational vaccine studies will be invited to participate in a study. Those who do not begin a study within 1 month of the screening tests may need to repeat some tests for continued consideration. In addition some studies require repeated measures of CD4 counts and viral load over a period of a few months.    ,NCT00051519
HIV,A New Tablet Containing Two FDA-Approved Drugs In HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Not Received Prior Therapy, This is a 48-week study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new tablet formulation containing two FDA-approved drugs in HIV-infected patients who have not received prior therapy. This tablet will be taken with one of two FDA-approved drugs as a once-daily regimen.

HIV,Differences in Blood Levels of Nevirapine in HIV-infected Patients in Uganda and the United States, This study will determine whether blood levels of the anti-HIV medicine nevirapine are different in HIV-infected patients in the United States from patients in Uganda. People from all over the world take medications to treat HIV infection. These medicines work well in some people but not in others and they cause harmful side effects in some people and not in others. These differences may be related to variations in how much of the drug reaches the blood. Differences in drug blood levels among people in various areas of the world may be attributed to differences in diet state of health ability to absorb the medicines from the stomach ability to eliminate the drugs from the body and the brand of medicine taken. This study will help scientists learn whether differences in blood levels of HIV medicines are important in determining how well the drugs work in different patient populations. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older in the United States and in Kampala Uganda who have been on an antiretroviral treatment regimen that includes at least 28 consecutive days of nevirapine may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood tests. Participants will have a total of approximately about 5 ounces of blood drawn during this 6- to 8-hour study. They will come to the NIH clinic in the morning and a catheter (plastic tube) will be inserted into an arm vein for collecting blood. (Alternatively blood can be collected by a needle inserted into an arm vein.) Blood will be withdrawn according to the following schedule:   -  About 5 tablespoons will be collected upon arrival at the clinic after an overnight fast. Within 30 minutes of this blood draw the patient will have breakfast and take his or her morning dose of nevirapine along with any other medications that need to be taken at that time.   -  1 tablespoon of blood will be drawn 2 hours after the nevirapine dose.   -  1 tablespoon of blood will be drawn 4 hours later (6 hours after the nevirapine dose). The blood will be analyzed for levels of nevirapine and possibly other HIV medicines. Some of the blood will be stored for later analysis of genes (cytochrome P450 and MDR1) that are involved in eliminating medicines from the body.    ,NCT00054743

HIV,Safety and Efficacy Study of Etanercept (Enbrel) on the Response Rate of HIV-infected Subjects, The purpose of conducting this already-FDA approved Phase I clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of etanercept (Enbrel) on the response rate in HIV-infected subjects who have failed to respond to conventional antiretroviral (HAART) therapy and for whom no alternative therapy exists. The greatest challenge faced by HIV-treating clinicians today is the management of virologic failure and metabolic complications of anti-HIV treatment. Treatment failure can occur because of non-compliance drug discontinuation lack of drug potency inadequate drug plasma concentration or drug resistance. Of these drug resistance remains the single most important reason for virological failure and rapidly limits treatment options.    ,NCT00091741
HIV,A Study Comparing Safety Of Abacavir And Lamivudine Administered Once-Daily As A Single Tablet Versus The Same Drugs Administered Twice-Daily As Separate Tablets (ALOHA Study), This study was designed to evaluate if subjects who took 600 mg of abacavir and 300 mg of lamivudine once-daily as a single tablet were just as likely to have adverse events compared to subjects who took 300 mg of abacavir and 150 mg of lamivudine administered as separate tablets twice-daily.    ,NCT00094367

HIV risk behaviors social networking patterns and HIV prevalence among youth at these venues will be assessed by administering anonymous computerized interviews to eligible and willing youth. This information will be shared with community partners during scheduled working group meetings.    ,NCT00103896
HIV,Typology of Adherence in Adolescents: Phase II, A number of factors influence HIV-positive adolescents' acceptance of and willingness to continue taking anti-HIV medicines. These factors include mental health and substance abuse issues barriers such as lack of medical insurance and cognitive-behavioral barriers (such as a person's impression of the impact of the medicines on his/her health and a person's sense of his/her ability to continue taking the medications prescribed). The purpose of this study is to use a survey to determine how common specific barriers are that prevent HIV positive adolescents from taking their anti-HIV medicines and if those barriers cluster together. The information collected will be used to develop and validate a schema for classifying HIV medication adherence by barriers to adherence or clusters of barriers to adherence. This classification schema could then be used in the development of interventions that better meet the needs of HIV-infected youth.    ,NCT00106678

HIV,Staccato: A Trial of CD4 Guided Treatment Interruption Compared to Continuous Treatment for HIV Infection, Treatment of HIV repairs the immune system but continuous treatment is expensive and causes side effects. Would it not be better to treat intermittently e.g. stop treatment when the immune system has recovered and start again only when damage reappears? That is the question which STACCATO proposes to answer. Approximately 500 patients were recruited for this trial from 2002 to 2004. One third were treated continuously; in two thirds the treatment was interrupted whenever the CD4 count a measure of immune recovery exceeded 350. At the end of 2005 the two treatment groups will be compared in order to see which fared better regarding amount of drugs used side effects CD4 counts and development of resistance to treatment.    ,NCT00113126

HIV,Influence of Pravastatin on Carotid Artery Structure and Function in HIV-infected Patients Under Antiretroviral Therapy, The advent of new antiretroviral agents in particular Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) spectacularly reduced HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. However new complications have appeared in HIV-infected patients treated by with HAART such as dyslipidemia insulin resistance diabetes mellitus and related cardiovascular complications including acute coronary syndromes peripheral vascular disease and stroke have been reported. A linear association has been proved between increased intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (CCA-IMT) aortic stiffness (pulse wave velocity [aPWV]) and incidence of cardiovascular events suggesting that IMT and aPWV could be considered as an early marker of atherosclerosis. The progression of IMT has been shown to be predictive of cardiovascular events. Case control and longitudinal studies but not all have suggested an increase CCA-IMT in HIV-infected patients under HAART compared with non-HIV infected patients with different progression. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of pravastatin on CCA-IMT and aortic stiffness in dyslipidemic HIV-infected patients receiving HAART by using a high-resolution echotracking system. Patients in the pravastatin group were consecutively recruited in four department of infectious diseases if they fulfilled the following criteria : (1) HIV-infected treated with HAART for > 12 months 2) with dyslipidemia defined as fasting serum LDL cholesterol > 160 mg/dL before initiation of pravastatin (3) treated with pravastatin > 12 months and one more coronary risk factor. The patients in the control group were selected consecutively in the same departments among 1) HIV-infected patients treated with HAART > 12 months 2) fasting serum LDL cholesterol > 160 mg/dL 3) without lipid-lowering drugs and one more coronary risk factor. Cases and control patients were matched for age gender and tobacco consumption. Using data from Mercie et al. inclusion of 42 patients in pravastatin and control groups was the minimum sample size needed for detection of a 6.5% difference in CCA-IMT in a two-sided test (a = 0.05 b = 0.20).

HIV,Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) Suppression to Prevent HIV Transmission, The University of Washington has received funding to conduct a proof-of-concept trial to assess the impact of suppression of genital herpes on HIV infectiousness. This study (the Partners in Prevention Study) will enroll HIV discordant heterosexual couples in which the HIV-infected partner is co-infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) to test the efficacy of twice daily (bid) acyclovir (400 mg) given to the HIV-infected partner to prevent transmission to his/her HIV negative partner(s). This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial will provide evidence for the efficacy of HSV-2 suppression with daily acyclovir on HIV transmission among HIV-discordant couples among whom the HIV-positive partner is also HSV-2 seropositive with CD4 >250. The researchers hypothesis is that by decreasing the frequency and amount of genital HIV shedding standard doses of daily acyclovir 400 mg bid will reduce the rate of HIV transmission by 50% in HIV-discordant couples among whom the HIV-infected partner is HSV-2 positive. Under the study protocol version 4.1.1 3000 HIV-discordant heterosexual couples in which the HIV-positive partner is HSV-2 positive and has a CD4 count >250 will be recruited; participants will be followed for up to 2 years. A 4% per year HIV incidence in the placebo arm is assumed. The first study site began enrolling participants on 17 November 2005. As of September 2006 14 sites in Eastern and Southern Africa had participated in recruiting the 2300 HIV-discordant couples enrolled to date.    ,NCT00194519

HIV,Early vs Late Introduction of Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-infected Patients With Tuberculosis (ANRS 1295 CAMELIA), In Cambodia the prevalence of both tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is high. Data suggest that aggressive management of HIV infection which includes Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) during treatment of TB decreases both morbidity and mortality. On the other hand the use of HAART for patients with TB may cause severe complications due to drug-drug interactions and occasionally a temporary exacerbation of symptoms. These reactions may be particularly severe when HAART is started soon after the start of TB treatment. The proposed study aims to determine the optimal time to initiate HAART in previously untreated HIV-infected adult patients with TB and low CD4 cell counts.    ,NCT00226434

HIV,BASTA Study on STI in HIV Infected Patients, This is a single center independent study. The primary objective is to compare efficacy and safety of continuing a conventional HAART in chronically infected HIV patients with a therapeutic strategy based on long term immunologically driven treatment interruptions. Evaluation will be based on clinical immunological and virological response. Patients will be randomized in a ratio 1:2 to one of the two treatment arms: Control group continuing the ongoing therapy STI group performing long term CD4 guided structured treatment interruptions In the STI arm patients will stay off therapy until their CD4 count will drop < 400 cells/mcL. At that time point patients will resume the HAART regimen they were assuming before STI and will continue HAART until they CD4 count will raise > 800 cells/mcL and their HIV-RNA will drop below the detection limit of 50 copies/ml. When both the CD4 count and the viral load will be within these pre-set values they will stop therapy again. There is no limit to the number of interruptions and re-start cycles during the study period The study is powered to evaluate equivalence between the two strategies under the assumption of a failure proportion in the control arm at each time point not greater than 5% and a maximum allowed difference of 15%.    ,NCT00310245

MK-0518 is a investigational drug which means that is not yet FDA approved that works in a different way to other anti-HIV medicines to help kill the virus. We hypothesize that addition of MK-0518 to a stable anti-HIV regimen will reduce the viral load further in patients with undetectable plasma virus.    ,NCT00618371

HIV,Multicenter Randomized Double-Blind Double-Dummy Phase 3 Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Elvitegravir Versus Raltegravir, The purpose of this study is to compare the safety tolerability and efficacy of a regimen containing once-daily elvitegravir (EVG) versus twice-daily raltegravir (RAL) added to a background regimen (1 fully-active ritonavir (RTV)-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) plus 1 or 2 additional antiretroviral (ARV) agents) in HIV-1 infected ARV treatment-experienced adults who have documented resistance or at least six months experience prior to screening with two or more different classes of ARV agents. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive EVG plus background regimen (Elvitegravir group) or raltegravir plus background regimen (Raltegravir group). Due to known drug interactions participants in the Elvitegravir group receiving RTV-boosted atazanavir (ATV) or RTV-boosted lopinavir (LPV) as part of their background regimen will receive elvitegravir at a lower dose (85 mg).    ,NCT00708162

It is administered topically with DermaPrep to target Langerhans cells. Langerhans cells with DermaVir migrate to lymph nodes and express HIV-like particles that induce immune responses to kill HIV-infected cells.   -  Hypothesis: Single DermaVir immunization is safe and immunogenic measured by induction of HIV-specific precursor/memory T cell responses.   -  GIHU004 was a phase I dose escalation study conducted in Hungary. It evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of three dosing regimens of topical DermaVir immunization for the treatment of HIV-infected individuals on fully suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).    ,NCT00712530
HIV,The Effect of Vitamin D and Calcium on Bone in Pediatric HIV, We have observed that vitamin D deficiency as evidenced by low serum 25(OH)D concentrations is common in children and adolescents with HIV infection. To determine whether vitamin D and calcium supplementation improve bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected children and adolescents we propose a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing supplementation with oral vitamin D and calcium to placebo. The specific aims of this project are to:   1. Determine the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on bone mineral accrual in HIV-infected children. We hypothesize that BMC and BMD will increase to a greater extent in HIV-infected children who receive supplementation with vitamin D and calcium. This hypothesis will be tested by comparing changes in BMC and BMD measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) after one and two years of treatment in HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving vitamin D and calcium supplementation compared to those receiving placebo.   2. Determine the effect of HIV infection and vitamin D and calcium supplementation on indices of mineral metabolism and markers of bone turnover. We hypothesize that indices of mineral metabolism and markers of bone formation and resorption will return toward normal in HIV-infected children and adolescents who are randomized to receive vitamin D and calcium supplementation. We will test these hypotheses by comparing longitudinal changes in indices of mineral metabolism and bone turnover markers in HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving vitamin D and calcium supplement versus those receiving placebo   3. Evaluate if vitamin D stores are a determinant of bone mass in HIV infected children and adolescents receiving HAART. We hypothesize that vitamin D stores as assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are an important determinant of bone mass in HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving HAART. We will test this hypothesis by evaluating whether measurements of bone mass are associated with vitamin D stores as measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and other indices of mineral metabolism in treated HAART-treated HIV-infected children and adolescents.    ,NCT00724178
HIV,Safety and Efficacy Study of Switching From Epzicom to Truvada, This protocol describes a prospective randomized open-label multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching from fixed dose abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) to fixed dose emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in virologically suppressed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected subjects maintained on a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r)-containing antiretroviral (ARV) regimen.

HIV,Maraviroc as an Immunomodulatory Drug for Antiretroviral-treated HIV Infected Patients Exhibiting Immunologic Failure," Many people with HIV fail to regain normal CD4 counts despite effectively suppressing HIV replication with medications. Blocking the ""co-receptor"" for HIV might decrease inflammation of the immune system potentially providing an immune benefit. The goal of the current trial is to determine whether adding maraviroc a new CCR5 ""co-receptor"" blocker decreases inflammation providing an immune benefit for patients with low CD4 counts despite undetectable viral loads on HIV medications. In this study HIV-infected patients who are receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV will receive either maraviroc or a placebo (sugar pill) each day for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks the study medication will be stopped and all subjects will be followed for 12 more weeks. Blood tests measuring the extent of inflammation low-level viremia and immune function will be measured throughout the trial and compared between treatment arms.    ",NCT00735072
HIV,Analysis of HIV-1 Replication During Antiretroviral Therapy, This study will determine if the level of virus in HIV-infected patients taking antiretroviral medications for prolonged periods decreases or persists at a stable level. It will also examine whether new gene changes (mutations) occur during drug suppression. HIV-infected patients who are 18 years of age or older have been enrolled in another NIH protocol have been suppressed on antiretroviral therapy and have very low levels of virus in their blood may be eligible for this 5-year (or more) study. Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center about every 6 months for a physical examination routine and research blood tests and leukapheresis to collect white blood cells for T cell analysis. For leukapheresis blood is collected through a vein much like donating whole blood but the blood is directed through a machine that separates and extracts the white cells and returns the rest of the blood components to the patient. Patients may also have an optional third clinic visit each year for another blood draw.    ,NCT00767312

The safety and efficacy of MK-0518 400 mg b.i.d. compared to placebo both in combination with OBT will be assessed by review of the accumulated study data in HIV-infected patients with hemophilia.    ,NCT00797381
HIV,Micronutrients and Antioxidants in HIV Infection, Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes decline in immunity or the ability to fight infection and progresses to acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS). Anti-HIV drug treatment has improved the prognosis of persons with HIV infection but is expensive and potentially toxic. Low micronutrient levels occur in the blood even in early stages of HIV infection and increase risk of a poorer prognosis but the role of micronutrient and antioxidant supplements in medical management of HIV/AIDS is not well defined. The proposed clinical trial aims to assess if supplementation of untreated HIV-infected adults with a micronutrient and antioxidant preparation can delay decline in immunity or disease progression or start of anti-HIV drug treatment compared with supplementation with standard multivitamins. If the findings are positive the study has implications for health and health care savings.    ,NCT00798772
HIV,Comparative Study of Three NNRTI-Sparing HAART Regimens, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) guidelines recommend that HIV infected patients who have never received anti-HIV therapy be treated with a triple drug regimen. The most commonly prescribed and successful regimen contains the medication efavirenz (EFV). However this regimen may not be an option for everyone hence alternative regimens are needed. This study was designed to look at how well different combinations of anti-HIV drugs work to decrease the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) of and allow immune system recovery in people who have never received anti-HIV therapy. This study also examined drug tolerability and safety for the various drug combinations.    ,NCT00811954

HIV,Effect of Raltegravir on Endothelial Function in HIV-Infected Patients," Recent studies suggest that HIV patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular events; however the mechanisms underlying this increased risk remain unclear. Our group was one of the first to demonstrate that HIV infection is independently associated with accelerated atherosclerosis as measured by carotid artery-intima media thickness (IMT) and that HIV-associated inflammation may be driving this accelerated atherosclerosis. The mechanism by which HIV disease independent of any drug-specific toxicity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease during HAART is not known. We hypothesize that even well controlled HIV infection is independently associated with cardiovascular risk and that further decreasing HIV-associated inflammation adding newer antiretroviral agents will also decrease cardiovascular risk. We will perform a small clinical trial of approximately 50 HIV-infected patients each to study the relationship between HIV infection inflammation thrombosis atherogenic lipoproteins and measures of atherosclerosis. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To determine the influence of traditional and novel markers of inflammation on endothelial function and IMT progression; Aim 2: To determine if ""intensification"" with raltegravir in subjects on long-term antiretroviral therapy with clinically undetectable HIV RNA levels will improve endothelial function and to determine if this effect is mediated by alterations in inflammatory markers lipoproteins and/or thrombotic factors. For Aim 2 subjects from 2 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled raltegravir intensification studies will be asked to co-enroll in this cardiovascular study.    ",NCT00843713

HIV,Epidemiology and Pathogenesis of HIV-Associated Pulmonary Hypertension, The purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology of pulmonary hypertension in individuals with HIV infection and to investigate its pathogenesis. We propose to conduct a prospective observational cohort study to determine the association between highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and viral suppression in HIV-infected patients who have been identified to have pre-clinical pulmonary hypertension (Aim 1). In addition we will investigate the mechanistic role of the HIV-1 Nef protein and HHV-8 infection in the development and progression of pulmonary hypertension in individuals with HIV (Aim 2). We will also investigate endothelial function in HIV-infected patients with pulmonary hypertension (Aim 3).    ,NCT00845013

HIV,Impact of Antiretroviral Therapy on Metabolic Skeletal and Cardiovascular Parameters, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) guidelines recommend that HIV-infected people who have never received anti-HIV therapy be treated with a triple drug regimen (commonly called combination antiretroviral therapy cART). Since the introduction of cART morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients has been dramatically reduced. However metabolic skeletal and cardiovascular diseases have been increasingly reported among HIV-infected patients and may be attributable in part to the direct effects of cART. Much of our understanding of the development of these diseases risk factors and consequences of these disorders has been derived from clinical studies of HIV-infected persons receiving older antiretroviral agents. A5260s was designed to examine the contributions of HIV-disease related factors and impact of newer antiretroviral drugs on the development of metabolic (such as blood vessels blood sugar cholesterol) skeletal and cardiovascular diseases in people who have never received anti-HIV therapy. A5260s is a prospective substudy of a phase III randomized clinical trial A5257 (see ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00811954). A5257 was designed to look at different combinations of anti-HIV drugs that do not contain the medication efavirenz (EFV) and how well these drug combinations work to decrease the amount of HIV in the blood and to allow immune system recovery in people who have never received anti-HIV therapy. A5257 also examined drug tolerability and safety for the various drug combinations.    ,NCT00851799
HIV,Pharmacotherapy for HIV Infected Patients With Alcohol Problems, This is a randomized double blind clinical trial to test the effect of Naltrexone on HIV infected heavy drinkers. The study will select 40 HIV positive patients who meet criteria for heavy drinking. Treatments include Naltrexone (25-100mg)and placebo. Patients will be treated followed up and assessed for a duration of 12 weeks. The investigators associated hypotheses Hypothesis 1: Naltrexone will reduce the frequency of heavy drinking. Hypothesis 2: Naltrexone will lead to maintenance or improvement in CD4 lymphocyte count and decreased HIV RNA levels. Hypothesis 3: Naltrexone will lead to a reduction in sexual risk behaviors. Hypothesis 4: Naltrexone will lead to improved adherence to HAART. Hypothesis 5 (Exploratory): Naltrexone will be well-tolerated with minimal side effects and patients will exhibit good treatment retention.    ,NCT00854230

This will be determined by giving Raltegravir along with Buprenorphine and by measuring the amount of Raltegravir and Buprenorphine in the blood. The investigators will also learn about the effects of Buprenorphine on Raltegravir and about the safety of taking these two medications together.    ,NCT00858962
HIV,Can Valacyclovir Delay the Need for Initiation of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Treatment in HIV-infected Individuals?, This study is a multicentre randomized placebo-controlled fully blinded clinical trial of twice daily oral valacyclovir 500mg versus placebo with the goal of delaying the need for initiating HAART among HIV infected individuals who neither use nor require HAART and who have not used chronic suppressive anti-HSV therapy for at least the 6 months prior to study initiation.    ,NCT00860977
HIV,Raltegravir Activity In Lymphoid Tissues, The reduction with antiretroviral therapy (ART) of HIV RNA in blood and HIV RNA in infected cells and in viruses associated with the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network in lymphatic tissues typically follows a two-phase pattern of decline. The half-life of the first-phase is about 1 day and that of the second phase is about 14 days with comparable estimates for first-phase decay in SIV-infected rhesus macaques. While substantial evidence supports the current view that first-phase decay reflects the death of activated CD4+ T cells infected before ART was begun the sources of viral RNA in the second phase have not as yet been conclusively established. Possible sources of viral RNA that have been invoked in mathematical models or for which there is experimental evidence include longer-lived infected cells such as macrophages and resting CD4+ T cells dissociation of virus from the FDC network and productively infected CD4+ T cells that are not subject to clearance by host immune responses because of waning levels of HIV antigen. Raltegravir (MK-0518) belongs to a new class of integrase inhibitors that potently suppress HIV and SIV replication and reportedly markedly alters the second phase HIV decline in a way that challenges the current view that longer-lived infected cells are the source of virus in this phase. While mathematical modeling of decay of HIV RNA in blood was most consistent with 1) cells newly infected by long-lived cells or 2) from activation of latently infected cells with full-length unintegrated HIV DNA as a source of second phase virus we think the data are also quite consistent with the greater efficacy of integrase inhibitors in a particular cell type and/or anatomic site such as the gut. In this protocol we will test the hypothesis that the rapid decrease in HIV replication associated with raltegravir is due to a more complete suppression of viral replication in lymphatic compartments such as lymph nodes and gastrointestinal lymphatic tissue. We will also investigate compartment-specific intracellular levels of raltegravir to potentially explain differences in changes in these compartments.    ,NCT00863668

HIV,Safety and Immune Response of a Rotavirus Vaccine in HIV-infected and Uninfected Children Born to HIV-infected Mothers, Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children accounting for 45% of severe diarrhea disease in both developed and developing countries. Annually rotavirus causes approximately 111 million episodes of gastroenteritis requiring home care 25 million clinic visits 2 million hospitalizations and approximately 440000 deaths in children less than 5 years of age of which approximately 90% of hospitalizations and 99% of deaths occur in developing countries. Although rotavirus infection is not more common in HIV-infected children it complicates their care and interferes with their nutrition. Chances of death by these infections can be greater in HIV-infected children when they also suffer from wasting malnutrition and/or opportunistic infections. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the Rotavirus vaccine candidate RotaTeq in HIV-infected and uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers.    ,NCT00880698

HIV,Raltegravir in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, Since June 2007 raltegravir has been available in Switzerland within a named patient program for patients who have virologic failure triple class experience and resistance and no other treatment options. This proposal has been designed to evaluate efficacy and safety data among patients who receive raltegravir within the routine clinical practice in Switzerland and who participate in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. This is a combined retrospective analysis of patients who already received raltegravir and a prospective part of patients who enter the named patient program and will be followed up in a standardized way. In the prospective part patients will also be able to receive raltegravir in case of intolerance to their current medication with virologic suppression. The analysis will primarily use descriptive statistics. In addition we will assess the duration of virologic response and focus on predictors of HIV RNA suppression during a follow-up of at least 6 months. In the prospective part we will assess trough plasma levels of raltegravir and other antiretrovirals. In patients who will develop virologic failure genotypic and phenotypic resistance to raltegravir (and other antiretrovirals) will be performed to characterize the evolution of resistance during the raltegravir-containing regimen.    ,NCT00904644

HIV,Antiretroviral-Sparing Concept With HIV-specific T Cell Precursors With High Proliferative Capacity (PHPC), PHPC-02 is a phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to investigate whether therapeutic immunization during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) induces elevations of HIV-specific T cell precursors with high proliferative capacity (PHPC) in HIV-1-infected individuals and whether the quantity of PHPC correlates with the viral load set point following analytical treatment interruption (ATI). Subjects will be randomized to receive either DermaVir Patch (8 subjects per cohort) or DermaVir Patch Placebo (8 subjects per cohort) every four weeks for three applications while receiving maximally suppressive HAART. HAART will be discontinued at Week 9 for an ATI period of 20 weeks.    ,NCT00918840
HIV,Comparing Blood Vessel Endothelial Function in HIV-Infected People and Matched HIV-Uninfected People, The blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body are normally capable of relaxing and constricting when needed to provide more or less blood to the body. The inability of blood vessels to relax and widen may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. One potential cause of this inability is inflammation. Because HIV infection is associated with inflammation it is possible that the blood vessels in people infected with HIV may not relax properly. The purpose of this study is to determine whether people infected with HIV have worse blood vessel function than people without HIV infection.    ,NCT00919724
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Alendronate for Bone Mineral Density in HIV-infected Children and Adolescents, HIV-infected children youth and adults have lower bone mineral density (BMD) than would be expected for HIV-uninfected people of similar age weight and race. As the majority of perinatally HIV-infected U.S. children are entering or in adolescence the potential for HIV-related impaired BMD during the adolescent peak of bone mass acquisition is of particular concern. The primary purpose of this study was to compare changes from pre-treatment levels of BMD of the lumbar spine after 24 and 48 weeks of alendronate treatment with placebo in HIV-infected children and adolescents.    ,NCT00921557
HIV,A Pilot Study of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to Evaluate Safety Acceptability and Adherence in At-risk Populations in Uganda Africa, This study will evaluate the safety and acceptability of intermittent and daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimens with FTC/TDF (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in HIV discordant couples and it will directly compare adherence and intracellular drug levels in daily and intermittent PrEP recipients. It will also evaluate the relationship between drug adherence sexual behavior and intracellular drug levels with an intermittent PrEP regimen. In addition it will evaluate the relationship between adherence to an intermittent PrEP regimen and timing of sexual activity in relation to PrEP dosing. The pilot will use objective medication event monitoring (MEMS) adherence measurement and evaluate the feasibility of newer adherence measurements such as hair sampling and plasma drug levels. This study will also evaluate the feasibility of using text messaging (SMS) to collect sexual activity data in an African setting. It will allow study teams and communities to prepare for potential subsequent larger trials of intermittent PrEP. The study is not sized to evaluate efficacy. If the intermittent PrEP regimen is safe feasible in terms of adherence and achieves intracellular drug levels similar to daily PrEP the data could be used to design a larger phase 2 study with one or more intermittent PrEP regimens. The goal of such a larger trial would be to provide bridging data if daily PrEP regimens are found to be effective or to prepare for efficacy or non-inferiority trials of intermittent versus daily PrEP. Investigation of immune responses associated with FTC/TDF will also be evaluated in the pilot study. The proportion of volunteers on FTC/TDF with HIV-specific immune responses due to exposures that did not lead to established HIV infection will be assessed at 2-3 time points and compared to responses in volunteers assigned to placebo. Immune responses may be correlated with risk behavior and host factors such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. As noted above very few HIV infections are expected to occur during the study so correlation of HIV-specific immune responses and protection from infection or attenuation of disease progression will not be possible until a larger study is conducted.    ,NCT00931346
HIV,Comparing Daily vs Intermittent Regimen of ATT in HIV With Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Acquired Rifampicin Resistance has emerged as an important issue in the treatment of HIV-TB patients. It has not been a major problem in HIV-negative individuals treated for TB treated with standard intermittent regimens. The study would generate data on the efficacy of daily and thrice weekly regimen of ATT in pulmonary TB patients with HIV in the presence of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Not many trials have compared sputum conversion and adverse drug reaction between daily and intermittent regimens of ATT in HIV positive patients. This study provides a unique opportunity for comparison of daily and intermittent therapy for HIV patients with pulmonary TB looking into multiple dimensions of HIV-TB treatment namely efficacy drug resistance toxicity  drug interaction and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The primary outcome of the study is to compare the efficacy of three anti-TB regimens in a) reducing bacteriological failures and b) decreasing the emergence of Acquired Rifampicin Resistance (ARR). The secondary outcomes include unfavourable responses (clinical failures deaths relapses) as whole treatment emergent adverse drug reactions pharmacokinetic levels of ATT and incidence of immune reconstitution syndrome.    ,NCT00933790

HIV,Integration of Family Planning and HIV Services in Tanzania," HIV positive women and couples have broad reproductive health needs that are not always met within HIV services. The integration of family planning (FP) services into Tanzania's HIV Care and Treatment Clinics (CTC) will address the fertility desires of CTC clients and ultimately result in the reduction of unintended pregnancies and HIV incidence. One strategy for integrating FP and CTC services is to use a ""facilitated referral"" model. Facilitated referrals are enhanced referrals for additional services that have been used in other settings and which are the preferred intervention strategy the Government of Tanzania would like to pilot test. This study will evaluate the feasibility effectiveness and costs of implementing a ""facilitated referrals"" intervention by examining FP use among female clients attending HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment Centers. This study will measure whether there is a reduction in unmet need for contraception among female CTC clients after the facilitated referral integration intervention has been implemented.

HIV,Pharmacokinetic and Safety Study of Raltegravir and Atazanavir in a Once Daily Dose Regimen in HIV-1 Infected Patients, The licensed dose of raltegravir is 400 mg twice daily with or without food. Raltegravir is metabolized predominantly through glucuronidation by UGT1A1. Atazanavir increases the plasma concentrations of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily by 72% due to inhibition of UGT 1A1. This suggests that combined use of atazanavir and a lower dose frequency of raltegravir once daily for example is possible. Another reason why raltegravir most likely can be applied is that its pharmacodynamic effect is not related to Cmin but to AUC which is expected to be similar for an 800mg QD dose when compared to 400mg BD. Phase III clinical trials evaluating QD dosing of raltegravir are currently ongoing and interim results are expected to be published in mid 2009. A regimen of atazanavir and raltegravir in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine may be a well tolerated and effective NNRTI- and ritonavir-sparing regimen that could be an attractive option for both first and second line (after NRTI/NNRTI failure) treatment regimens.    ,NCT00943540

HIV,Effect of HIV Infection and Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART) on Bone Homeostasis, Advances in HAART have been a huge success story in the management of HIV infection. However serious metabolic complications including osteoporosis and bone fractures are increasingly been seen with HAART and the responsible mechanisms remain poorly elucidated. The skeleton continually regenerates through homeostatic bone remodeling. Osteoclasts the cells responsible for bone resorption form under the influence of the key osteoclastogenic cytokine Receptor- Activator of NF-KB (RANKL). The osteoclastogenic and pro-resorptive activities of RANKL are moderated by its physiological decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG). Increase in the ratio of RANKL to OPG accelerates the rate of osteoclastic bone resorption leading to osteoporosis. The investigators' preliminary studies have now demonstrated that in an animal model of HIV/AIDS the HIV-1 Transgenic rat the development of osteoporosis is recapitulated as observed in human patients. Furthermore the investigators found that B cell expression of OPG is significantly downregulated concurrent with a significant upregulation in production of RANKL.    ,NCT01020045

HIV,Observational Study of the Therapeutic Study of Recombinant HIV-1 TAT, The results of the Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Recombinant HIV-1 Tat (ISS P-001 and ISS T-001) indicate that the vaccine based on the recombinant Tat protein is safe well tolerated and immunogenic. The present study is intended to extend the follow-up of the volunteers for additional 3 years to evaluate the persistence of the anti-Tat humoral and cellular immune responses. The results of the present study will be key for the design of future phase II trials particularly for the definition of the optimal schedule for boosting immunizations. All individuals (27) will be enrolled in a 120-weeks observational study and monitored every 24 weeks for the following 3 years. During these visits which are performed within the schedule indicated for the clinical monitoring of HIV-1 infected individuals in addition to the routine virological hematological and biochemical assessment the anti-Tat specific humoral and cellular immune responses will be evaluated.    ,NCT01024595

HIV,Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study of Autologous T-cells Genetically Modified at the CCR5 Gene by Zinc Finger Nucleases in HIV-Infected Patients," This research study is being carried out to study a new way to possibly treat HIV. This agent is called a ""Zinc Finger Nuclease"" or ZFN for short. ZFNs are proteins that can delete another protein named CCR5. This CCR5 protein is required for certain types of HIV (CCR5 tropic) to enter into and infect your T-cells. T cells are one of the white blood cells used by the body to fight HIV. The most important of these are called ""CD4 T-cells."" Some People are born without CCR5 on their T-cells. These people remain healthy and are resistant to infection with HIV. Other people have a low number of CCR5 on their T-cells and their HIV disease is less severe and is slower to cause disease (AIDS). Even with no detectable levels of HIV in the blood HIV remains in some tissues in the body primarily the gut tissue. HIV infects the CD4+ T-cells including in the blood and gut. The new treatment to be studied will involve removing white blood cell from the blood that contains CD4+ T-cells. The extracted CD4+ T-cells are then genetically modified by the ZFNs to be resistant to infection by HIV by removing the CCR5 gene from the surface of the CD4+ T cell where HIV enters the cell. Additional genetically modified cells are manufactured and then re-infused back into you. Researchers hope that these genetically modified cells will be resistant to infection by HIV and will be able to reproduce additional resistant CD4+ T-cells in your body. Laboratory studies have shown that when CD4+ T-cells are modified with ZFNs HIV is prevented from killing the CD4+ T-cells. On the basis of these laboratory results thre is the potential that ZFNs may work in humans infected with HIV and improve their immune system by allowing their CD4+ T-cells to survive longer. The purpose of this research study is to find out whether ""zinc finger"" modified CD4+ T-cells are safe to give to humans and find how ""zinc finger"" modified T-cell affects HIV.    ",NCT01044654
HIV,HIV Treatment and CVD Events, Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been associated with HIV infection. However it is uncertain whether increased CVD rates are associated with HIV-related factors (e.g. HIV-infection or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may worsen dyslipidemia) or reflect differences in the prevalence of underlying risk factors for CVD. Furthermore the association between initiation and duration of HAART exposure and CVD risk including which specific drugs within the HAART classes may contribute to the increased risk is unknown. The primary objectives of the study are therefore: 1. To estimate the absolute and relative incidence rate (IR) of CVD claims-based diagnoses among a cohort of adult patients from a large managed care population with a claims diagnosis of HIV AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) during periods of exposure to:   -  Any HAART compared to no HAART exposure   -  HAART class [i.e. NRTIs NNRTIs PIs and Other (i.e. fusion inhibitors)] compared to no HAART class exposure   -  Specific NRTI medications compared to no specific NRTI exposure    ,NCT01054638

HIV,Male Involvement in Antenatal Care and the Prevention Programme of Mother-to-child Transmission of HIV in Uganda, HIV /AIDS is a major public health problem in Uganda. The prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV/ AIDS (PMTCT) was launched in Uganda in November 2001 and in Mbale Hospital in May 2002. Currently PMTCT services have been integrated into mainstream antenatal care services throughout the country. Though engaging men as partners is a critical component in the PMTCT programme their involvement has been low. Measures to increase male partner involvement in the PMTCT programmes have not been explored in Uganda. Objectives: To determine the effect of a written invitation letter to the spouses of women attending their first antenatal visit on: (a) couple attendance at subsequent antenatal clinic visits; and (b) couple acceptance of HIV testing. Study site: The study will be carried out at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital in eastern Uganda Study design: A randomised clinical trial among 1060 (530 intervention and 530 control) new antenatal attendees. The intervention will be a written invitation letter to their spouses. Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is the proportion of pregnant women who come with their partners for ANC at the subsequent antenatal visit. Utility: The results of this study will be utilised in re-orienting the ANC services to encourage male participation and hopefully improve the uptake of the PMTCT services at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital.    ,NCT01144234

HIV,Safety of and Immunogenicity to an H1N1 Influenza Vaccine in HIV-infected Adults, This is a randomized open label phase II trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different schedules of vaccination against influenza A H1N1 in HIV-infected individuals in which each of the randomized groups will be compared with HIV-negative volunteers vaccinated with the regimen indicated by the Brazilian National Immunization Program. Will be included in the study HIV-infected patients stratified by CD4 count (< 200 cells/mm3 or > 200 cells/mm3) at the time of screening for the study not receiving antiretroviral therapy treatment or receiving stable treatment for at least 8 weeks with no plans to change over the next 6 months eligible to receive vaccine against influenza A H1N1. The control group will be formed by HIV-negative individuals confirmed by serology performed at screening eligible to receive vaccine against influenza A H1N1. Patients infected with HIV will receive one of two possible vaccination regimens: 1) 3.75 µg in two applications 21 days apart 2) 7.5 µg in two applications 21 days apart. The volunteers in the control group will receive a single application of 3.75 µg dose of the vaccine. The study's hypotheses are: 1) The vaccine against the H1N1 virus promotes antibody titers above the level specified for protection (seroconversion) being as safe and well tolerated in patients HIV-1 infected as in non HIV-infected volunteers; 2) The proportion of seroconversion for H1N1 virus vaccine at a dose of 3.75 µg in HIV-1-infected patients is similar to the proportion of seroconversion induced by the same vaccine at a dose of 7.5 µg; 3)The proportion of seroconversion with one dose of the vaccine against H1N1 virus is similar to the proportion after the second dose.    ,NCT01155037
HIV,Peer Leaders as HIV Risk Reduction Change Agents Among Injection Drug Users (IDUs) in Ukraine," Using a randomized clinical trial (RCT) this study is designed to assess the effectiveness of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) risk-reduction interventions targeting injection drug users (IDUs) in three Ukraine oblasts (regions). The investigators propose to compare the effectiveness of a revised and updated manually-driven HIV testing and counseling intervention the Counseling and Education (C & E) model developed by NIDA with the C & E plus a manualized network intervention. At each site Odessa Donetsk and Nikolayev 250 ""index members"" and 500 of their network members will be recruited through street outreach over a 32-month period and randomly assigned to C & E alone or C & E plus the network intervention. Participants will be tested for drug metabolites interviewed using ACASI (Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interviewing) and given a rapid test for HIV at baseline 6 and 12-months. At six-months network members will be asked to recruit two others they inject with but who are not in the study. Primary outcomes include knowledge self-efficacy injection and sex-related risk behavior reduction and partner disclosure among indexes and primary and secondary network members and intervention diffusion to secondary network members. The investigators hypothesize more positive and significant change including injection and sex risk reduction intervention diffusion and partner disclosure among indexes as well as first and second network members in the network plus C & E arm compared to C & E alone. Specific aims include:   1. To compare the effectiveness of the C & E alone with the additive effect of a network intervention plus C & E in increasing knowledge about HIV and increasing self-efficacy to practice safer injection and sex-related behaviors among indexes primary and secondary network members.   2. To assess the effectiveness of the C & E alone with the additive effect of a network intervention plus C & E in reducing drug and sex risk behaviors among indexes primary and secondary network members.   3. To compare the extent of intervention diffusion to second wave network members in the two arms.   4.

HIV,Cohort of HIV Associated Lymphomas," The incidence of lymphomas is increased among HIV infected patients. In 70 % of cases those are Non Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) in 30% of cases. In France their incidence is estimated to 100 cases per year (data from the ""Base de données Hospitalière Française sur l'Infection à VIH"" (FHDH)). The main mechanisms involved in lymphomagenesis are immune dysfunction involvement of oncogenic viruses (Epstein-Barr (EBV) and HHV8) and molecular oncogenic events. A better understanding of these different pathways give the possibility to design specific treatments. The treatment of these lymphomas is not standardized. A prospective study of patients with HIV associated lymphoid malignancies is an innovating tool to answer epidemiological physiopathological and therapeutic questions. We propose a prospective multicentric study of these patients. The main objectives of this prospective study are to:   -  evaluate the incidence characterise clinically and histologically NHL and HL cases associated to HIV   -  perform an observational study of the treatment and outcome of these patients out of the context of clinical trials   -  study the differentiation and activation of B-cell populations   -  better understand the role of specific T cell responses in the control of EBV infection   -  allow other biological studies from the ANRS group "" Lymphome et VIH "". The recruitment of 40 cases per year is expected. The length of inclusions is 7 years. The follow-up will be of 2 years. Clinical pathological and biological data at diagnosis and during follow-up will be collected. This will allow characterizing the lymphoma the HIV infection the antitumoral treatments and the outcome of lymphoma. Biological samples will be centralized to collect cell DNA RNA plasma serum and tumour collections (Y.Taoufik S Prevot* ). To better understand the EBV infection and lymphomagenesis in HIV infection we propose to follow the viral load and the molecular characteristics of EBV in PBMC plasma and tumour (P.Morand*  V.Boyer* ) to investigate the EBV-T cell responses (G.Carcelain) and the presence and reactivation of EBV in peripheral B cells (C.Amiel*  JC Nicolas) and in tumoral samples (M.Raphael*  I.Joab* ). The other mechanisms of lymphomagenesis in HIV infection will be studied by the analysis of the sub-populations of B-cells in terms of activation and differentiation (Y.Taoufik) and by the characterization of MSI tumours (A.Duval).

HIV,PK Switch Efavirenz to Maraviroc in Patients Initially Suppressed on an Efavirenz-containing Regimen, The purpose of the study aims is to help determine whether it is safe to change directly from efavirenz to maraviroc in patients who are stable on an efavirenz-containing regimen. The pharmacokinetics (drug levels) of efavirenz and maraviroc when efavirenz is stopped and maraviroc is started will be assessed. Both the study patients and the study team will know which treatment is being taken at all times in the study.    ,NCT01190293
HIV,Switching From Efavirenz to Atazanavir/ Ritonavir in HIV-infected Subjects With Good Virologic Suppression, The purposes of this study are to evaluate if switching an antiretroviral medication from efavirenz (EFV) to atazanavir/ ritonavir (ARV/r) will in a 96-week period change:   1. the amount of fat in HIV patients with lipoatrophy   2. metabolic lab values such as your lipid (fat) profile glucose (blood sugar) and insulin (a hormone that regulates glucose) in HIV patients with lipoatrophy.    ,NCT01194856
HIV,Atripla to Raltegravir Switch Study for CNS Toxicity, The purpose of the study is to investigate the benefits of switching away from efavirenz (part of the combination pill Atripla®) in patients with central nervous system side effects (such as insomnia {difficulty with sleeping} bad dreams etc). The investigators will investigate the effect of switching to Truvada (a combination pill of tenofovir and emtricitabine the other two components of Atripla) plus raltegravir. Raltegravir is a licensed drug for HIV treatment which showed side effects were fewer in number when compared to efavirenz in 2 other clinical studies where patients were starting HIV treatment for the first time. This study will also investigate the safety (in terms of other side effects and the routine blood tests which the investigators ordinarily use to monitor your treatment) and monitor effectiveness your viral load and CD4 counts when you switch treatment from Atripla® to Truvada/raltegravir.    ,NCT01195467
HIV,Early Lung Cancer Diagnosis in HIV Infected Population With an Important Smoking History With Low Dose CT: a Pilot Study, Early Lung Cancer diagnosis in a HIV-infected population with an important smoking history with low-dose CT: a pilot study: the HIV-CHEST study Objectives The main objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of lung cancers detected by low-dose computed tomography (CT) in a HIV-infected population with an important smoking history. Other objectives are (1) the evaluation of the types of lung cancers in this population as well as (2) the staging of non small cell lung cancers (3) the description of risk factors for all lung cancers if they are numerous enough and (4) the number of complications of diagnosis procedures during the study.    ,NCT01207986

HIV,Bone Loss and Immune Reconstitution in HIV/AIDS (BLIR-HIV), With the increasing age of people living with HIV/AIDS age-induced osteoporosis is likely to be compounded by HIV/AIDS and HAART-associated bone loss. Mechanistically osteoclasts the cells responsible for bone resorption form under the influence of the key osteoclastogenic cytokine Receptor- Activator of NF-KB (RANKL). The osteoclastogenic and proresorptive activities of RANKL are moderated by its physiological decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG). Imbalance in the ratio of RANKL to OPG alters osteoclastic bone resorption and lead to osteoporosis. Activated T- and B-cells are a major source of RANKL while normal physiological B-cells are a major source of OPG. T-cells regulate the production of OPG by B-cells. Thus changes in the immune system induced by HIV/AIDS and/or by HAART could affect B-cell and T-cells RANKL and OPG production. Indeed data from our group shows that in an animal model of HIV/AIDS the HIV-1 Transgenic rat the development of osteoporosis is recapitulated as observed in HIV-infected patients and B-cell OPG and RANKL production are concurrently down regulated and upregulated respectively. Furthermore preliminary data in HIV-infected subjects suggests dramatic acute upswing in bone resorption following HAART initiation that peaks at 12 weeks and then declines. Based on these findings the investigators hypothesize HAART associated bone loss is driven by immune reconstitution. Because this effect of HAART is dramatic in magnitude but short in duration the investigators propose to apply antiresorptive agent (zoledronic acid reclast®) to specifically spare patients from this dramatic but acute bone damage.    ,NCT01228318
HIV,Protease Inhibitor Monotherapy Versus Ongoing Triple-therapy in the Long Term Management of HIV Infection (PIVOT), The PIVOT trial aims to determine whether a strategy of switching to PI monotherapy is non-inferior to continuing triple-therapy in terms of the proportion of patients who maintain all the drug treatment options that were available to them at baseline after at least 3 years of follow-up and to compare clinical events safety toxicity and health economic parameters between the two strategies.    ,NCT01230580
HIV,Depot Contraception With and Without Lopinavir/Ritonavir, DMPA (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or the 'depot' injection) is a widely used contraception. It is popular in woman with HIV as it probably still works when you take HIV drugs. HIV drugs can increase or decrease the level of other drugs (e.g. contraceptives) in your bloodstream which may make them work less well or increase side effects. It is assumed that DMPA can be given with HIV drugs there are no studies proving this. The purpose of the study is to investigate whether an HIV drug combination containing lopinavir/ritonavir affects DMPA when they are taken at the same time.    ,NCT01231451
HIV,Hydroxychloroquine for Discordant CD4 Responders on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of adding a drug called hydroxychloroquine usually used to treat rheumatoid arthritis to patients' usual antiretroviral combination. HIV causes activation of some parts of the immune system and this immune activation may persist despite effective antiretroviral therapy. Ongoing activation may be responsible for poor CD4 rise on antiretroviral therapy and for some HIV-related complications. Drugs like hydroxychloroquine work by inhibiting immune activation. The study will primarily investigate the effect of adding this medication on immunological parameters (particularly CD4 count) on other safety parameters (such as cholesterol) patients' side effects and viral load. If you decide to take part the duration of your involvement in the study will be 24 weeks plus two screening visits up to 84 days prior to the start of the study and a follow up visit.    ,NCT01232660
HIV,Study of Lopinavir/ Ritonavir and Lamivudine Versus Standard Therapy in Naïve HIV-1 Infected Subjects., The purpose of this study is designed to compare the safety tolerability antiviral activity and immunological effect of lopinavir/ritonavir plus lamivudine (3TC) versus standard therapy with 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of naïve HIV-1 infected subjects.    ,NCT01237444
HIV,Vorinostat in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Solid Tumors and HIV Infection, This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of vorinostat when given together with paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel and carboplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving vorinostat together with paclitaxel and carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.    ,NCT01249443
HIV,Impact of Raltegravir on the Viral Reservoirs, The objective of the antiretroviral treatment is to inhibit the viral replication estimated(appreciated) by the measure of the viral plasmatic load(responsibility). In this inhibition of the viral replication usually joins an immune reconstruction [ 1 ]. Nevertheless a viro-immunological dissociation i.e. an undetectable viral load(responsibility) and an absence of immune reconstruction is regularly observed. It is now turned out that an undetectable viral load(responsibility) does not correspond to the total absence of viral replication and that it is possible to detect of the intracellular pro-viral DNA . Raltegravir ® because of its mode of action(share) inhibiting the integration of the pro-viral DNA in the chromosomes of the infected cells(units)  could decrease the intracellular reservoir of monocyte-macrophages improve the homeostasis so optimizing the cooperation lymphocytes T - macrophages. Several experimental data suggest that the regression of the abnormalities of cellular interactions and the rate of apoptose abnormally raised(abnormally brought up) by cells(units) T at the patients in viro-immunological dissociation could be obtained . This study aims at measuring the impact of Raltegravir ® on the viral reservoirs lymphocyte and monocyte to quantify the expression of the molecules of costimulation the source(spring) of intercellular interactions lymphocytes - monocytes and to measure the rate of apoptose of the cells(units) T.    ,NCT01249560
HIV,Immunosuppression in HIV-infected Patients With Tuberculosis in Ethiopia, Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV are leading causes of disease and death in Subsaharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) dramatically improves prognosis in HIV infection but TB is still a common complication in HIV-infected subjects. Management of TB-HIV co-infection is complex both with regard to diagnosis and treatment. Since scaling-up of ART requires management of most patients in primary health care it is critical to achieve better strategies for TB-HIV co-infection at peripheral levels of the health care system in endemic regions. This includes development of new methods to assess the severity of HIV disease and the need to start ART during TB treatment in this population. Aims: To compare a scoring system for clinical signs of immunosuppression with CD4 cell counts to assess HIV disease severity and indications for ART initiation and to correlate immunosuppression status with treatment outcome. Workplan: CD4 cell levels and results of clinical scoring has been compared in 1100 patients with TB using HIV-negative subjects with TB treatment for control. Inclusion was closed in February 2012 and follow-up of participants completed in August 2012. Plasma levels of immune activation and inflammatory markers will be correlated with the degree of immunosuppression. Significance: TB is the most significant clinical challenge to the successful scaling-up of ART in Africa. In order to improve management in primary health care it is necessary to find robust and reliable techniques for determining disease severity and identification of patients who need to start ART during TB treatment. This study may contribute to increased knowledge in this field and help to modify guidelines for management of TB-HIV co-infection in Ethiopia as well as in other resource-limited settings.    ,NCT01252537
HIV,Improving Antiretroviral Medication Adherence Among HIV-infected Youth: Phase I, HIV is increasing among adolescents and young adults in the US. Antiretroviral medications when taken correctly (??0% of prescribed doses taken) can vastly improve life expectancy. However adherence among HIV-infected young people is suboptimal and few interventions are available to help adolescents adhere to treatment. The first phase of the study is an intervention development phase which includes conducting interviews with 40 HIV-infected youth for input on the adaptation of the approach. The information obtained from the qualitative interviews is used to adapt the Life-Steps intervention (designed by our group for HIV-infected adults) to be responsive to the needs of HIV-infected adolescents with acceptability of topics and content and feasibility of intervention delivery to be tested in an open pilot trial.    ,NCT01253850
HIV,Improving Immunogenicity of Influenza Vaccine in HIV Infected Individuals, The overall goal of this study is to compare the safety and immunogenicity of trivalent Fluzone® High-Dose vaccine vs the regular standard-dose (SD) in HIV infected individuals. Our hypothesis is that Fluzone® HD will be safe and more immunogenic than the currently used vaccine    ,NCT01262846
HIV,Cohort of Young Adults Infected With HIV Since Birth or During Childhood, Background: With the improvement of the prognosis for HIV-infected infants thanks to the availability of antiretroviral therapies young adults infected with HIV since birth are becoming an emerging group among the HIV-infected population. Morbidity mortality and immunovirological evolution in these young adults need to be studied in a large population and compared to patients infected with HIV later in adulthood or to the general population in terms of mortality. Moreover the study of accelerated or premature ageing linked to HIV and/or antiretroviral therapy is particularly interesting in this population. Objectives: To study the transition to adulthood and the further evolution of HIV-1 or -2 perinatally infected young adults: 1) To study the teenager to adult transition in terms of clinical and immunovirological status schooling and professional integration sexuality and reproductive life transition from paediatrics to adult departments; 2) To study prognosis morbidity and mortality according to age infection stage at the time of antiretroviral initiation and therapeutic history; 3) To study the incidence and expression of adverse events and the potential link to antiretroviral therapies; 4) To study the markers of a potential premature ageing from the metabolic cardiovascular and immunological points of view.    ,NCT01269632
HIV,A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Bruthas Project, African American men who have sex with men and women (AAMSMW) are at particular risk for contracting and transmitting HIV and represent a priority population for developing effective interventions. Despite the urgent need for effective prevention approaches for AAMSMW to our knowledge no evidence-based HIV interventions have been developed and tested for this population. This study is a randomized controlled trial of the Bruthas Project(BP) an individual-level HIV prevention intervention which builds on standardized HIV counseling and testing. Delivered in a series of four sessions by trained African American male counselors the BP focuses on reviewing HIV transmission routes for male and female partners strengthening sexual communication skills with both male and female partners and improving condom use skills and other safer sex negotiation strategies. A randomized controlled trial of BP is necessary to determine the efficacy of the intervention and can lead to improved public health efforts at reducing HIV risk behavior among AAMSMW and in the African American community more generally. To evaluate the effect of the BP the investigators will recruit and enroll a cohort of 400 AAMSMW who will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition in which they will be offered BP or to the comparison condition in which they will receive standardized HIV testing and counseling with referral to case management. The investigators will follow the cohort over 9 months and will assess participants at three time points: baseline 3 months follow-up and 6 months follow-up.    ,NCT01270230
HIV,The Intensive Pharmacokinetics Sub-study of Encore1 (ENCORE1-PK), Safety and efficacy are key issues in antiretroviral therapy (ART) selection. Efavirenz (EFV) is an important component of combination ART in treatment naive individuals. Like many drugs there are inter-individual differences in the efficacy and tolerability of EFV. The Encore1 study provides an opportunity to examine the pharmacokinetics (PK)(processes by which a drug is absorbed distributed metabolized and eliminated by the body) of EFV in blood samples collected over a 24-hour dosing interval in participants receiving either standard 600 mg or reduced 400 mg dose EFV once daily.    ,NCT01271894
HIV,Study in Healthy Volunteers of the Safety and Metabolism of Different Doses of the Anti-HIV Drug TMC278LA., TMC278 (also called rilpivirine) is a new drug being developed to treat HIV. Usually TMC278 is taken as a tablet by mouth once a day but a 'long acting' formulation has been developed so the drug stays in the bloodstream for a longer time - this allows the drug to be given by injection and less often. It is hoped that this injectable version of the drug may be used to help prevent HIV transmission in the future by giving it to people who are at risk of HIV. This is similar to the way travellers to areas with malaria may take antibiotics to prevent infection. The investigators aim to investigate the feasibility of using TMC278 as a preventative medication by performing this study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the levels of drug which can be measured in the blood as well as the tissues and fluids of the rectum (the lowest part of the bowels just before the opening of the anus) as well as the safety of the drug and how well tolerated it is when given as a single dose. In this study the investigators will not be investigating whether the drug prevents HIV so the investigators will recruit people who are HIV negative and whose lifestyle does not put them at risk of becoming infected before or during the study. If the study shows the drug is well tolerated and produces appropriate levels of the drug (in the bloodstream and the rectal compartment) to suggest that it could be effective it will help design future studies looking at preventing HIV.    ,NCT01275443

HIV,Interferon Alfa Sensitivity in HIV/HCV Persons Before and After HIV Meds, The chief purpose of this research is to evaluate interferon alpha sensitivity and cell type specific levels of interferon receptor and interferon stimulated genes and proteins in HIV/ HCV (hepatitis C virus) coinfected persons before and after administration of HIV medications (antiretroviral therapy).    ,NCT01285050
HIV,The Pharmacology/Aging Clinic, The treatment of HIV and the tests performed for HIV care have changed over the last 20 years. However improvement of management of HIV-infected subjects is still warranted especially as the HIV-infected population is aging. Therefore this study will involve the collection and analysis of clinical information obtained from subjects who are over 50 years of age. For example patients' risk of heart disease will be measured and monitored by looking at blood tests and clinical data (such as blood pressure). This will allow researchers to understand if the current way of assessing the risk of future heart disease is the best one available for HIV-infected individuals. No genetic research will be done.    ,NCT01286623
HIV,Modified Dose and Schedule of Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccination in HIV-infected Adult Subjects, The purposes of this study include 1) to compare the seroconversion rate of an intensive standard-dose regimen (0 1 2 and 6 months) to a standard-dose regimen (01 and 6 months) and 2) to compare the seroconversion rate of an intensive double-dose regimen (40 μg at 012 and 6 months) to a standard-dose regimen (20 μg at 01 and 6 months) of HBV vaccine in HIV-infected adult patients.    ,NCT01289106
HIV,Interferon Alpha 2b Intensification in HIV-Positive Individuals on Antiretroviral Therapy, Background:   -  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been able to improve the lifespan of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) but ART requires continuous treatment that has substantial consequences on quality of life. ART suppresses HIV-1 virus levels below the limits of detection in current tests but does not completely eradicate the virus from the blood. Recent research is attempting to determine whether this persistent infection stems from a low-level infection where new cells are continually infected with HIV or from cells that live for a long time after infection. ART is very active against the virus in new cells but has no effect on long-lived cells that are already infected with HIV-1 at the start of ART. As a result new strategies may be necessary to reduce or eradicate these 'reservoir' cells.   -  Interferon is a natural substance made by the body to combat virus infections but can also be made as an injectable drug known as PEGINTRON. PEGINTRON injections have been approved to treat hepatitis C infection including in patients with HIV infection. Earlier studies of HIV-infected individuals who were not on any ART showed that interferon reduced the level of HIV in the blood. Researchers are interested in determining whether PEGINTRON therapy will also reduce the residual low levels of HIV in patients who are already taking ART. Objectives: - To evaluate the effectiveness of PEGINTRON injections on HIV levels in participants currently undergoing antiretroviral therapy. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with HIV are currently undergoing antiretroviral therapy and have maintained HIV virus blood counts that are not detectable by current commercial tests for at least 12 months before the start of the study. Design:   -  This study will involve separate screening and treatment processes.   -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history including blood and urine samples. The screening analysis to determine study eligibility will take several weeks. Participants will have apheresis to provide sufficient numbers of blood cells for evaluation by the study researchers.   -  Eligible participants will begin a 4-week course of PEGINTRON injections using the standard dose of PEGINTRON that is approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Participants will have weekly injections and have frequent blood tests to measure HIV virus levels.   -  Participants who experience problems in maintaining safe numbers of white blood cells during the study may receive injections of filgrastim to increase their white blood cell count.   -  After the 4 weeks of treatment participants will return for additional blood tests on study days 28 35 42 49 56 and 84 and Weeks 16 24 36 and 48 (i.e. through the end of 1 year after the start of the study).    ,NCT01295515
HIV,Study on Immunopathogenesis in HIV and Hepatitis C Coinfection, Liver-related death is the leading cause of mortality in HIV-infected individuals with CD4+ cell counts over 200 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the greatest risk for liver-related mortality in HIV-positive patients. Compared to HCV monoinfected individuals patients with HIV and HCV coinfection experience accelerated progression of liver fibrosis which can lead to higher incidence of cirrhosis end stage liver disease (ESLD) and death. Changes in CD8+ T-cell activation inflammatory cytokines and serum markers of tissue injury may offer an immunologic platform to determine factors associated with progressive liver fibrosis in coinfected patients. In this cross-sectional study we will evaluate whether HIV and HCV coinfection patients with well-controlled HIV infection who have an undetectable viral load exhibit abnormal levels of inflammation and immune activation potentially contributing to advanced liver fibrosis. Comparative groups include coinfected patients successfully treated for hepatitis C or who have absence of hepatitis C viremia through spontaneous clearance hepatitis C monoinfected patients and HIV-positive patients with well-controlled HIV infection without hepatitis C. Liver fibrosis will be measured by non-invasive methods. The primary objectives of this study are:   1. To determine if there are differences in markers of inflammation and immune activation in subsets of patients with HIV hepatitis C and HIV and hepatitis C coinfection.   2. To assess the stage of liver fibrosis using non-invasive methods in subsets of patients with hepatitis C and HIV and hepatitis C coinfection and compare the degree of liver fibrosis with levels of inflammation and immune activation.    ,NCT01296529
HIV,Effects of Treatment With Aprepitant (Emend®) in HIV Infected Individuals. 375 mg Dose, The investigators' in vitro data suggest that Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists like aprepitant will decrease the expression of CCR5 an essential co-receptor in the life cycle of HIV in the surface of macrophages and lymphocytes to levels at least similar to those observed in patients heterozygous for the CCR5 32 mutation. Together with a direct potential antiviral effect this could alter disease progression in patients with HIV infection. The investigators' hypothesis is that aprepitant is safe tolerable and has antiviral activity in HIV infected individuals. This is randomized placebo controlled double blind study to determine the safety and antiviral activity of aprepitant by comparing the change in HIV RNA viral load after 2 weeks of aprepitant monotherapy. 18 HIV infected males and females ??18 years old who have early infection with CD4 cell counts ??350 cells/mm3. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive 375 mg of aprepitant (Emend®) or placebo.    ,NCT01300988

Lauderdale); 2) identify the independent covariates of baseline substance abuse and sexual risks; 3) evaluate through random assignment of participants the relative effectiveness of two intervention conditions in reducing sexual risks and substance use as measured at 3- 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments: a) an innovative five-session risk reduction intervention derived from psychological empowerment theory titled Project GOAL; and b) an enhanced community standard-of-care HIV counseling Comparison Condition.    ,NCT01327898
HIV,The Role of Inflammation and Aging in HIV-Associated Cardiovascular Risk," It is the central hypothesis of the investigators study that HIV disease is a pro-inflammatory condition and that years of inflammation result in premature ""aging' of the immune system (""immunosenescence""). Just as these changes are thought be causally associated with heart disease in the very oldthe investigators postulate that these changes will be associated with early heart disease in the untreated and perhaps treated HIV disease. To address this hypothesis the investigators will measure immunosenescence in a large cohort of patients who span the entire disease process.    ",NCT01333644
HIV,Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Changes in Nevirapine AUC Due to Differences in Weight, This study would be a prospective cohort study stratified by weight. Patients who are stable on nevirapine for at least 3 months prior to study entry but no more than 1year will be recruited. For 1 week subjects will take their morning dose of nevirapine in the clinic (and be observed taking it) and given their evening dose to take at home. Subjects will need to record the date and time they take their evening dose. At the end of the week the subjects will be sequestered at the clinic for blood draws for a 12hr pharmacokinetic sampling. They will not be brought back in at 24hrs as they will need to be redosed after 12hrs. They will have Liver Function Tests (LFT's) and other labs drawn at study entry and one month after the end of study. Pharmacokinetic levels will be analyzed using standard mathematical models and Area Under the Curve (AUC) Maximum concentration (Cmax) and Minimum Concentration (Cmin) will be compared between groups.    ,NCT01335360

HIV,Improving Antiretroviral Medication Adherence Among HIV-infected Youth, HIV is increasing among adolescents and young adults in the US. Antiretroviral medications when taken correctly (??90% of prescribed doses taken) can vastly improve life expectancy. However adherence among HIV-infected young people is suboptimal and few interventions are available to help adolescents adhere to treatment. The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) pilot trial of Positive STEPS (the adapted form of the Life-Steps behavioral intervention) to improve medication adherence among HIV-infected youth. The study will allow us to demonstrate participant acceptance ability to recruit feasibility of intervention delivery with study counselors and all study procedures and initial clinically significant improvement in medication adherence via MEMS caps. This research will lay the groundwork for a federal grant application for a multi-site randomized controlled intervention trial.    ,NCT01347437
HIV,Switch to Unboosted Atazanavir With Tenofovir Study, A drug-drug interaction between the anti-HIV drugs tenofovir DF (TDF) and atazanavir (ATZ) results in lower ATZ plasma levels when the drugs are given together particularly in patients not taking ritonavir to boost ATZ levels. Lower plasma drug levels may make the anti-HIV regimen less effective in controlling the HIV virus levels in the blood. For this reason current treatment guidelines recommend that ATZ always be boosted with ritonavir in regimens also containing TDF. However withdrawal of ritonavir is often desirable given the tolerability and toxicity issues with this agent even at the low dose (100 mg daily) used to boost ATZ. For example ritonavir can cause stomach upset nausea diarrhea high cholesterol levels and liver enzyme abnormalities. However there is evidence that plasma ATZ levels may not predict treatment success on unboosted ATZ regimens particularly among people whose plasma HIV virus is already under control and unboosted ATZ is being used as a maintenance strategy. In the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program (DTP) nearly 100 patients originally treated with ritonavir-boosted ATZ + TDF (+ FTC or 3TC) are receiving successful maintenance therapy with unboosted ATZ and the same TDF-based backbone. The study will examine the hypothesis that switching to maintenance therapy with unboosted ATZ 400mg daily will have similar 48-week virologic efficacy to continuing ATZ/ritonavir 300/100mg daily among HIV-infected adults with stable viral load suppression on regimens comprising ATZ/ritonavir 300/100mg daily with TDF plus either FTC or 3TC despite potentially lower ATZ trough levels with the unboosted regimen. In other words patients whose HIV viral load is undetectable while receiving TDF (+FTC or 3TC) and ATZ/ritonavir will continue to maintain an undetectable viral load after switching to unboosted ATZ without ritonavir in the same proportions as those continuing on their boosted ATZ/ritonavir regimen.    ,NCT01351740
HIV,Role of HIV on Glutathione Synthesis and Oxidative Stress, HIV infection is associated the development of increased oxidative stress and deficiency of glutathione (GSH) the dominant endogenous antioxidant protein but the underlying mechanisms contributing to GSH deficiency are hitherto unknown. Furthermore GSH metabolism has not been studied in HIV patients in whom the burden of risk factors promoting oxidative stress is highest. Our previous studies in non-HIV human subjects with diabetes-related oxidative stress and GSH deficiency have demonstrated that the latter is due to decreased synthesis of GSH. Importantly short-term dietary supplementation with the simple GSH precursor amino-acids cysteine and glycine boosted GSH synthesis and cellular concentrations corrected GSH deficiency and reduced oxidative stress and oxidant damage. The current proposal will study whether (1) defective synthesis underlies GSH deficiency in patients with HIV and will test a simple inexpensive and rational therapy based on protein supplementation to improve GSH synthesis and concentrations and lower markers of oxidative stress and oxidant damage in these patients; (2) study if correction of GSH deficiency is asssociated with any changes in (a) impaired mitochondrial fuel oxidation in the fasted and insulin stimulated states; (b) insulin sensitivity; (c) body composition and anthropometry; (d) forearm muscle strength; (e) plasma biochemistry and (f) quality of life indices in these subjects.    ,NCT01355198
HIV,Study to Assess the Seroprevalence of Anti-Tat Antibodies in HIV-infected Patients, Tat is a key HIV regulatory protein produced very early after infection prior to virus integration and necessary for viral gene expression cell-to-cell virus transmission and disease progression. Previous studies in natural HIV infection indicated that the presence of a Tat-specific immune response correlates with a lower incidence and reduced risk of progression to AIDS as compared to anti-Tat negative individuals suggesting that an immune response to Tat may exert a protective role and control the progression to AIDS in vivo. On the basis of the above mentioned consideration the present study was directed at investigating the seroprevalence of anti-Tat antibodies in HIV-infected South African patients.    ,NCT01359800

HIV,REMEMBER: Reducing Early Mortality & Morbidity by Empiric Tuberculosis (TB) Treatment, People with HIV have a high chance of becoming infected with TB especially when they live in areas where TB infection is common. It can be difficult to diagnose TB in people who need to start HIV treatment right away. Within about 6 months after starting HIV treatment some of these people can become very sick with TB and can even die from it. This study is being done in people who are starting HIV treatment and who live in areas where the TB infection rate is high. The purpose of this study is to test an experimental approach to TB treatment to see if it is better than the usual approach. The experimental approach is to start TB treatment at the same time as HIV treatment even when TB infection has not been found. The usual approach is to start TB treatment only if TB infection is found. In this study half of the people will start TB treatment at the same time as they start their HIV treatment. The other half will start TB treatment only if TB infection is found. The study will also test how safe and effective it is to start TB treatment at about the same time as HIV treatment even when TB infection has not been found. The study will collect information about diet whether (and when) people in the study become sicker or die how well their HIV is controlled how they are feeling how they are taking their medications whether it matters where they live or what kind of HIV and TB care is standard how many people are diagnosed with TB while in the study and how the cost of the two treatment options on a national level could be compared.    ,NCT01380080

HIV,Residual Risk Assessment Of HIV Transmission, The main objective of this one year multidisciplinary research is to estimate the frequency of seropositive men having sex with men (MSM) under antiretroviral therapy (ART) having an undetectable blood viral load (VL) and a detectable VL in semen. Design: Participants'inclusion (n=150) will be done in 6 HIV hospital departments participating to the research project. To warrant feasibility and diversity of participants needed the centers will be located in Paris and nearby suburbs. The study design is based on one blood and semen sample taken at day 0 and at day 30. Blood and semen samples will be taken in the enrolment centers. Biological and virological analyses will be performed by the laboratory of microbiology at Necker hospital on blood and semen samples. Pharmacological analyses are planned in a subsequent study. Socio-behavioral data will be collected through a self-administered questionnaire at day 0 and day 30. Schedule: Patients' enrolment collection of biological samples and questionnaires will last 10 months (end of first quarter 2012). Biological and virological analyses will be performed until the end of the first semester 2012. Quantitative and socio-behavioral data will be analyzed during the third quarter 2012. Results will be released at the beginning of year 2013.    ,NCT01413152
HIV,Prevention of Early Mortality by Presumptive Tuberculosis (TB) Treatment, This study investigates the prevention of early mortality in patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa where 79% of the co-infected cases of TB reside. Many published studies have shown a surprisingly high proportion of all patients initiated on ART dying within 6 months (8-26%) with increasing risk with decreasing CD4 T cell count. The majority (median 70%) occur in the first 3 months with the greatest proportion of deaths due to previously undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB). The investigators will enroll patients from 4 geographically diverse countries (Gabon Mozambique South Africa and Uganda) in a randomized open label clinical trial targeting a population of people with high mortality risk; patients with CD4 T cell count < 50 cells/μl and body mass index (BMI) < 18 kg/m2. Severely immunocompromised patients with low BMI in the intervention arm will receive presumptive anti-TB 4-drug chemotherapy and subsequently initiate ART within 2 weeks compared to ART alone. The main objective is to measure and compare early mortality in the group presumptively treated for TB in addition to ART. Other sub-objectives are to determine the predictors of early mortality and the causes of death by autopsy (traditional and verbal) to determine if presumptive anti-TB treatment affects viral suppression with ART and to assess incidence rates and characterize drug toxicity in patients dually treated. Because of the high rates of TB co-infection in sub-Saharan Africa in the HIV-infected the investigators expect that patients presumptively treated for TB in addition to HIV will have a lower mortality rate than patients receiving ART only. This trial is expected to be of great public health benefit and generalisability.    ,NCT01417988

HIV,Study to Evaluate Safety and Toxicity of Polyphenon E (EGCG) in HIV-1-Infected Individuals, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety toxicity dosing and antiviral effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in capsule form (Polyphenon® E) administered orally twice daily at three different doses in HIV-1-infected clinically stable treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced adults not on concomitant antiretroviral (ARV) therapy.    ,NCT01433289
HIV,Screening for Tuberculosis in HIV-infected Patients Eligible for Antiretroviral Treatment, Background: Increased access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Africa will require decentralization to primary health care. For this purpose adapted methods for management of patients co-infected with tuberculosis (TB) and HIV are needed. Improved detection of TB in patients starting ART and assessment of co-administration of ART and TB treatment are priorities in this field. Aims: To identify clinical predictors of TB in patients starting ART and to construct screening algorithms for TB in this population; to assess ART outcomes in patients receiving TB treatment at health centre level. Work plan: The project is performed in health centres providing ART in Ethiopia. A cohort of HIV positive patients initiating ART is prospectively followed. Baseline characteristics are registered; blood samples for CD4 cells HIV RNA and immunological markers are collected as well as sputum for TB culture and PCR. During ART clinical data CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels are followed. Patients with TB are compared to those without TB with regard to ART outcome. Baseline factors associated with TB will be used to construct TB screening algorithms. Recruitment of the cohort was completed in March 2013; follow-up for determination of long term outcome of ART will be continued until 2016. Significance: These studies give insight into TB-HIV co-infection at primary health care level in a Sub-Saharan region and may impact future guidelines for management of such patients.    ,NCT01433796

HIV,The Efavirenz (EFV) Central Nervous System Exposure Sub-study of Encore1, Persistent HIV infection in the central nervous system (CNS) compartment may put subjects at risk of developing HIV-related brain disease. Important factors associated with the development of HIV-related brain disease include therapeutic concentrations of antiretroviral drugs in the CNS. Conflicting evidence regarding the CNS exposure of the antiretroviral drug used for the encore1 study efavirenz (EFV) have been described in related studies. There were recent study of two small series assessment of EFV exposure in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF); one group reported small detectable EFV concentrations while another observed undetectable EFV exposure in the CSF. Also in a larger reported series comprising of 80 subjects on EFV-containing antiretroviral therapy a CSF to plasma concentration suggested that there is limited movement of EFV out of the CSF. In HIV-1 infected subjects at steady state EFV plasma level parameters are dose proportional following 200mg 400mg and 600mg daily doses. The CNS exposure of EFV at different daily dosing has not been described.    ,NCT01451333
HIV,RAltegravir Switch STudy: Effects on Endothelial Recovery, Treatment with HIV-infection with protease inhibitors is associated with high blood lipids and higher chance for cardiovascular complications. The RASSTER study aims to investigate the effect of switching the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir to raltegravir on vessel wall function and inflammationand activation of the immune system. we hypothesize that with this intervention these parameters will improve. Since decreased vessel wall function and inflammation are initial steps in the process of atherosclerosis it is important to know this data when treating HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT01453933
HIV,Early Antiviral Therapy for Critically Ill HIV Infected Patients, The aim of the study is to verify the effect of HAART in critically ill HIV infected patients. The current practice is to begin antiviral therapy after ICU discharge when the condition of the patient is more stable. The investigators hypothesis is that the investigators can improve outcome of these patients with earlier antiviral therapy in the ICU. The investigators just have retrospective studies in this scenario. After admission to ICU patients are assigned to one of two arms: early HAART (within 5 days of ICU admission) or conventional therapy (initiation of HAART after ICU discharge). The following data will be collected: demographic variables CD4 count viral load drug toxicity opportunistic infection hemodialysis mechanical ventilation and vasoactive drug. The patients will be followed to determine ICU mortality hospital mortality and 6-month mortality.    ,NCT01455688

HIV,On Demand Antiretroviral Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Infection in Men Who Have Sex With Men," This phase III multi-centre comparative double-blind randomized trial on 2 parallel groups is designed to evaluate a strategy for the prevention of HIV infection including ""on demand"" antiretroviral pre-exposure with Truvada versus placebo associated with overall prevention (counselling condoms sexually transmitted diseases (STD) screening hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccinations and post-exposure treatment of HIV infection) in men who have sex with men (MSM) exposed to the risk of HIV infection. Indeed recent studies have reported a higher incidence of new HIV infection in MSM as compared to the general population new approaches to the prevention of HIV infection are therefore necessary in order to consider the limits of current strategies.

HIV,Intranasal Modified Vacc-4x Gag Peptides With Endocine as Adjuvant, HIV-specific cellular immunity is hampered in most HIV-infected individuals. Therapeutic immunization in HIV aims to strengthen the HIV-specific cellular immunity usually in the absence of replicating HIV with antiretroviral drugs. The aims of this strategy can be to decrease the mass of latently infected CD4+ T cells better tolerance of drug-free periods and better select candidates for preventive HIV vaccines. Vacc-4x is one of the few peptide-based therapeutic vaccines tested and consists of four slightly modified HIV Gag p24 consensus peptides. Vacc-4x was first tested by intradermal injections using GM-CSF as adjuvant. A recent multinational placebo-controlled study found improvement of vaccine-specific T cell immunity and decrease in viral loads (presented at the AIDS vaccine 2011 conference Bangkok). In this study the investigators hypothesize that the Vacc-4x peptides deposited on the nasal mucosal surfaces in conjunction with Endocine a newly developed and documented mucosal adjuvant will induce T cell responses to HIV and improve HIV-specific immunity both systemically and at mucosal surfaces (oral rectal vaginal).    ,NCT01473810

CVC at 200mg (4 tablets 50mg each) QD + EFV matching placebo (1 capsule) QHS + FTC/TDF (1 tablet) QD; 3. CVC matching placebo (4 tablets) QD + EFV 600 mg (1 capsule) QHS + FTC/TDF (1 tablet) QD. The substudy will run for the duration of the primary study. 50 patients of the 150 total enrolled in the primary study will be referred to and enrolled in the cardiovascular substudy. Patients enrolled in the substudy and substudy protocol staff will be blinded to study treatment. Data obtained on this substudy will be analyzed in conjunction with laboratory data for cardiovascular disease risk factors and HIV-1 RNA levels obtained on the primary study. The primary study is a randomized double-blind double-dummy 48-week comparative study in approximately 150 HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve patients with CCR5-tropic virus. Patients will be stratified by Screening HIV-1 RNA level (??00000 copies/mL versus <100000 copies/mL) and randomized 2:2:1 to one of the three treatment groups. Patients will receive all medications from the primary study and thus the primary study site will be responsible for any adverse outcomes with the drug.    ",NCT01474954
HIV,Atazanavir/Ritonavir and Zinc Pharmacokinetic Study, The study is being conducted as the most common side effect of the HIV drug atazanavir (taken with ritonavir) is hyperbilirubinaemia. Bilirubin is a normal waste product from the body and gets broken down in the liver so it can leave the body through the gut. Atazanavir slows the breakdown of this chemical which can cause jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and/or scleral icterus (yellowing of the eyes). This is completely harmless; in fact up to 1 in 10 of the UK population have an inherited condition that causes the same yellowing. However some patients don't like this side effect and it is the commonest reason for switching off the drug. A study in people with Gilberts syndrome (the inherited condition that causes the same changes in the chemical bilirubin) showed that a mineral supplement (zinc sulphate) reduced the levels of bilirubin in the blood. The aim of this study is to see if using zinc supplements can achieve the same effect in patients with high bilirubin due to atazanavir use.    ,NCT01475227
HIV,Use of Incentives to Retain Drug Users in HIV Therapy, In many urban centres including Vancouver's Downtown Eastside there is a high rate of HIV infection among users of illicit drugs. Among drug users who present to care and start highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) retention in care and adherence to their treatment regimen may be less than optimal. Given the known benefits of HAART on both the individual and populational levels new strategies are required to help retain HIV-infected drug users on HAART. Contingency management (CM) is a strategy to affect behaviour by providing a reward (e.g. money) to reinforce the desired behaviour. CM has been used with success in other areas of medicine (e.g. smoking cessation weight loss) and in the drug using population but has not been established as a means to improve retention in HAART programs. The proposed research primarily seeks to assess the effectiveness of monetary-based CM in retaining HIV-infected drug users in HAART programs. 240 HAART-eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either receive (n=160) the reinforcer or to a control arm (n=80). All subjects will receive HAART and standard care and those randomized to the reinforcer arm will receive escalating reinforcement initially for attendance at each clinic visit (until month 6 after starting HAART) and subsequently (until month 12 after starting HAART) will receive an escalating variable reinforcer for each month in which a plasma viral load less than or equal to 100 copies/mL is maintained. Our hypotheses are that drug users initiating HAART and randomly selected to receive a reinforcer for attending clinic visits then maintaining monthly virologic suppression during the first 52 weeks after HAART initiation will be significantly more likely to achieve virologic suppression at 52 weeks will have a significantly longer duration of sustained virologic suppression during the first 52 weeks and will be significantly more likely to maintain virologic suppression at 72 weeks after HAART initiation than those not offered a reinforcer.    ,NCT01488942

HIV,Evaluating the Safety and Tolerability of Antiretroviral Drug Regimens Used as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis to Prevent HIV Infection in At-Risk Men Who Have Sex With Men and in At-Risk Women, Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a method of preventing HIV infection through the use of antiretroviral (ARV) medications before exposure to HIV. This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of four ARV regimens in preventing HIV infection in men who have sex with men who may be at risk of getting HIV infection through sex and women who may be at risk of getting HIV infection through sex. The four ARV regimens being evaluated are maraviroc (MVC) MVC plus emtricitabine (FTC) MVC plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and TDF plus FTC. The MVC-containing arms will be compared to TDF/FTC alone and in combination.    ,NCT01505114
HIV,Impact of Immediate Versus South African Recommendations Guided ART Initiation on HIV Incidence, This trial is evaluating a public health intervention strategy trial which aims to reduce the incidence of HIV at a population-level. The proposed strategy is a two steps process:   -  Extensive HIV counselling and testing and comprehensive prevention programme among a target population   -  Immediate ART initiation after HIV diagnosis irrespective of CD4 count criteria. The underlaying trial hypothesis is that HIV testing followed by immediate ART initiation of all HIV-infected individuals will prevent onward transmission and reduce HIV incidence in the population. This is a cluster randomised controlled trial with a total of 22 communities used as the units for randomisation.

HIV,Use of Incentives to Engage Drug Users in HIV Therapy, Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) the current standard of care for treatment of HIV infection is highly effective when taken appropriately. Before starting this treatment a person must be aware of their HIV status and present to a clinic for medical care. They then undergo screening procedures (medical assessment and laboratory tests) to determine whether they are eligible to receive HAART i.e. whether HIV treatment is necessary and safe for them. In many urban centres including Vancouver's Downtown Eastside there is a high rate of HIV infection among users of illicit drugs. However HIV-infected drug users often do not present to the medical system and complete the process necessary to start HAART. Given the known benefits of HAART new strategies are required to increase rates of HAART initiation in this group. Contingency management (CM) is a strategy to affect behaviour by providing a reward (e.g. money) to reinforce the desired behaviour. CM has been used with success in other areas of medicine (e.g. smoking cessation weight loss) and in the drug using population but has not been established as a means to improve HAART uptake. The proposed research primarily seeks to assess the effectiveness of monetary-based CM in engaging HIV-infected drug users in HAART programs. Drug users identified through outreach will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two arms; participants in one arm will be offered a monetary-based reinforcer to participate (n=150) and participants in the second arm will be offered no reinforcer (n=150). Participation involves reporting to the study site for formal study of eligibility screening consisting of clinical evaluation medical history and laboratory testing required to determine eligibility to receive HAART. Participants randomized to the reinforcer arm will receive gift cards at the completion of screening procedures. Our hypothesis is that drug users offered a monetary-based reinforcer will be significantly more likely to complete HAART eligibility screening than those not offered a reinforcer.    ,NCT01526421
HIV,Study Comparing Two Alternatives of Antiretroviral Therapy as Post-exposure Prophylaxis to HIV-1:FOVIR+EMTRICITABINA + LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR VS TENOFOVIR+EMTRICITABINA + MARAVIROC (MARAVI-PEP), As a measure of secondary prophylaxis and with the final objective of avoiding the infection it has been suggested to use antiretroviral therapy. This is known as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Although there are different recommendations almost every guideline recommend using 3 drugs as PEP both in USA and Europe. Toxicity is one of the main limitations of PEP. Side effects during PEP are very usual are attributed mainly to PI and are the main reasons for poor adherence or lost of follow-up. A current standard regimen is AZT+3TC (Combivir®) or tenofovir+emtricitabine (Truvada®) plus the PI lopinavir/r. Toxicity associated with this regimens are high (31-85% of cases) with a 10-35% interruption of PEP Maraviroc a CCR5 receptor antagonist very well tolerated coul be an adequate drug for PEP.    ,NCT01533272
HIV,Prospective Evaluation of Etravirine for HIV-infected Patients in Need of Lipid-lowering Drugs, Dyslipidaemia characterized by raised triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels is common in HIV-infected individuals and has been associated with HIV infection itself and antiretroviral therapy (ART). These abnormalities are well-established markers of cardiovascular (CVD) risk in the general population. Studies have suggested an increased risk of CVD associated with ART exposure over and above that conveyed by traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In HIV population to reduce lipid parameters the most usual clinical strategy remains to add a statin treatment. Recent studies suggested ART switch can represent an interesting alternative to statins to reduce lipid plasma levels. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the frequency with which the replacement of LPV/r (lopinavir/ritonavir) ATZ/r (atazanavir/ritonavir) DRV/r (darunavir/ritonavir) or EFV (efavirenz) by ETR (Etravirin) in dyslipidemic patients with suppressed viremia would obviate the necessity to administer statins. A prospective phase III study in which the statin treatment of dyslipidemic HIV patients on antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) will be interrupted during 4 weeks is proposed. At week 4 patients qualifying for a lipid lowering drug (calculated LDL-C??3mmol/L) will replace EFV LPV/r DRV/r or ATZ/r by ETR. The proportion of patients not qualifying anymore for a statin treatment at 12 weeks (i.e. after 8 weeks of ETR treatment) will be determined. Additionally the lipid level changes will be assessed at 12 weeks. Inflammatory markers will be measured at baseline at drug switch and at the end of the study Study drug will be provided by the drug manufacturer (Janssen-Cilag AG). Compliance for study drug will be done at week-4 and week-12 Returned study medication will be counted and the amount notified on the Case Report Form (CRF).    ,NCT01543035
HIV,Observational Study of Antiretroviral (ARV) Response in a Cohort of African Children Using Viral Load Monitoring, Background: Treatment of HIV-1 infected Ugandan children with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is increasing but few prospective long-term studies evaluating the treatment process have been reported. In this study we sought to determine prospectively how consistent monitoring of HIV-1 RNA levels impacts the ART treatment process. Methods: One hundred and eight children initiating ART were enrolled into this study. These children had comprehensive laboratory monitoring including HIV-1 RNA level determination and genotype analysis (where appropriate) CD4 % plus absolute counts and safety laboratory measurements performed prior to starting therapy and at regular intervals after receiving ART. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to examine predictors of survival and virologic failure. Viral genotype analysis was performed on samples obtained from children having virologic failure to determent the emergence of mutations.    ,NCT01555723
HIV,Testing and Linkage to Care for Injecting Drug Users in Kenya, Interventions for injecting drug users (IDUs) in sub-Saharan African have been almost entirely absent despite the fact that in countries like Kenya they contribute a growing proportion of incident HIV infections. This study will leverage a historic decision in Kenya to launch needle exchange program (NSP) and related services for this most-at-risk population (MARP). The investigators will use this NSP/MARP platform to seek out IDUs deliver rapid HIV testing point of care CD4 count and link to ART using peer case managers and evaluate community viral load impact using a stepped wedge cluster-randomized design.

HIV,Clinical Trial to Reduce Drinking in Women With HIV, The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether an intervention that involves the medication naltrexone will reduce drinking and improve health outcomes in women with HIV infection and hazardous drinking. Our central hypotheses are that compared to women who receive placebo (sugar pill containing no medicine) women who receive naltrexone will have decreased rates of hazardous drinking improved HIV medication adherence less rapid disease progression and reduced sexual risk behavior. The study design will involve 240 HIV-infected women with hazardous drinking who will be recruited from HIV clinics neighborhoods and referrals in Miami Florida. Eligible women will receive either a daily pill containing naltrexone (50mg) or an identical-appearing placebo for four months. All participants will receive encouragement and feedback related to their drinking regardless of medication assignment. The study participants will be assessed at two four and seven months after enrollment. The proposed work is innovative because pharmacologic treatment for alcohol has not been evaluated in HIV-infected women. If our hypotheses are confirmed the study findings would transform the approach to hazardous drinking within clinics serving HIV-infected women.    ,NCT01625091

Recent research shows that it may have an anti-HIV effect in the laboratory. Approximately 20 HIV-infected adults who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy will be given diflunisal by mouth twice daily for 4 weeks at a dose that has been shown to be safe when used to treat pain. Subjects will be monitored closely for safety and will have frequent blood tests during the study to see if the drug has any effect on the level of HIV in their blood.    ,NCT01676363
HIV,Gut Associated Lymphatic Tissue (GALT) in HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)- Infected Patients, To date despite the known benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) many HIV-infected people are presenting late with very low CD4+ T-cells levels below 350/ul. These patients are more likely to be diagnosed with opportunistic infections their risk of death is higher and their rate of immunological improvement is slower (Mussini C et al. 2008). These patients often present a real challenge due to their advanced clinical status (Borghi V et al. 2008). Unfortunately little is known about the clinical presentation of these patients their responses to antiretroviral treatment and especially about the changes in the adaptive and innate immunity of the GALT.    ,NCT01679067

HIV,Integrated Care Centers to Improve HIV Outcomes in Vulnerable Indian Populations, This is a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated care centers (ICC) to improve access to HIV testing prevention services and treatment among high-risk populations of injection drug users (IDU) and men who have sex with men (MSM) in India. We will collect baseline ethnographic and survey data from approximately 27 IDU or MSM sites in India. We will use baseline data to select 22 sites for the trial (12 IDU and 10 MSM) and to stratify sites according to key baseline characteristics. We will perform stratified randomization to assign sites to either the ICC intervention or to standard services. ICCs which will be either IDU or MSM-focused will provide an accepting atmosphere in which members of vulnerable groups can drop-in receive rapid HIV voluntary counselling and testing risk reduction counseling and services and antiretroviral therapy. ICCs will be scaled-up from existing governmental or non-governmental organizations and services provided at ICCs will be supported by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) of India. After providing services in communities for two years we will conduct an evaluation survey (with biological and behavioral measures) of approximately 1000 subjects in the target populations in each of the 22 study sites. Integrated care centers have the potential to improve access to HIV prevention and treatment services among vulnerable high-risk populations.    ,NCT01686750
HIV,Positive Change Agents Program-Tanzania (Evaluation), The Appreciative Inquiry Change Agents (CA) program (NAMWEZA) intends to address broad societal issues by engaging HIV-positive leaders as 'change agents' in their communities. In this study the CAs will be recruited from an HIV Care and Treatment Centre in Dar es Salaam. The Namweza program has the potential to address structural issues related to HIV risk such as access to limited resources through an entrepreneurial component of the program. A positive or appreciative focus promotes CAs to examine assets in themselves and in their networks encourages strengthening of relationships and facilitates planning for a positive future for themselves their families and their communities. A stepped wedge randomized trial will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the program for the following primary outcomes: uptake of HIV services among network members of the CAs; rate of unprotected sex and frequency of concurrent relationships among CAs and their social networks; and levels of self-esteem general self efficacy and risk of intimate partner violence in the CAs. Secondary outcomes include: depressive symptoms hopefulness and HIV-related stigma (among CAs); social support and quality of relationships (among CAs); and HIV knowledge attitudes and self-efficacy in preventing HIV transmission or re-infection (CAs and their networks). The following are primary hypotheses that will be tested through this stepped wedge randomized trial evaluation:   1. Uptake of HIV services will increase among individuals in the network of the HIV-positive Change Agents related to the intervention;   2. Levels of self-esteem and general self-efficacy will increase in trained Change Agents;   3. Rate of unprotected sex and number of concurrent partners will decrease (among network of Change Agents as well as Change Agents themselves; i.e. the 'study population'); and   4. Prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) will decrease in Change Agents. Secondary hypotheses are:   5. Prevalence of depressive symptoms and HIV-related stigma will decrease and level of hopefulness will increase in trained Change Agents;   6. Levels of HIV knowledge attitudes and self-efficacy in preventing HIV transmission and re-infection among CA and their networks will increase; and   7. Degree of social support and quality of relationships will improve among CA. If the proposed intervention is found to be effective linkages with the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and other stakeholders will enable scale-up of the program throughout the country.    ,NCT01693458

HIV,Co-receptor Tropism Determination of HIV-1 Subtype A Spread in the Russian Federation Using V3-based Genotyping Tools, To date all work related to the study of HIV tropism was performed on HIV B and C subtypes. In the studied samples HIV variants of subtype A were virtually absent. However the existence has been shown previously of some differences in the nucleotide sequences in the V3 loop of env region of subtype A from other subtypes of virus. In the Russian Federation the subtype A of HIV-1 is predominant and according to some estimates accounts for about 89% of all newly diagnosed cases of HIV infection. Thus it seems interesting and effective to study the characteristics of HIV-1 subtype A associated with the tropism in the Russian Federation. The primary objective is determination of the prevalence of R5 (chemokine receptor 5) X4 (chemokine receptor 4) and R5X4-tropic variants of HIV in HIV-infected population in Russia and analysis of the possible features of tropism of viruses belonging to subtype A.    ,NCT01823614

HIV,The Self-Collection Study: a Study of Self-collected HPV Testing and Results Counseling, Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer among women worldwide. Women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) bear a disproportionate burden of cervical cancer and its precursor cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) that result from persistent high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HIV clinical practice guidelines recommend two Pap tests in the year following diagnosis and if both are normal yearly thereafter. Nationally only 25% of women meet this recommendation. The mean annual Pap testing rate for federally funded HIV centers is only 55.7%. In 2009 quality improvement statistics from the Johns Hopkins Hospital Moore Clinic a large urban HIV center revealed an annual Pap testing rate of 59%. This occurred despite interventions to address adherence issues were implemented including nurse case management co-location of HIV and gynecology services flexible scheduling and continuity of care. Women keep their appointments for HIV primary care more often than for gynecology care in the Moore Clinic so an intervention that takes place during a primary care visit could improve cervical cancer screening rates. The availability of HPV testing provides a unique opportunity to increase perceived susceptibility to and severity of cervical cancer among women with HIV and to encourage follow-up Pap testing. HPV testing involves analyzing a sample of cervicovaginal cells for the presence of high-risk HPV strains. Detection of high-risk strains of the virus indicates a high risk for high grade CIN and cancer while a negative HPV test predicts a less than 2% risk of developing CIN. HPV testing can be easily conducted by women themselves through self-collection in a primary care visit. Studies of women without HIV who do not have regular Pap testing have demonstrated that self-collected HPV testing and results counseling increases the overall screening rate and women who test positive for HPV have a high rate of follow-up Pap testing. Self-collected HPV testing and results counseling could be utilized in the HIV primary care setting to promote Pap testing among women with HIV.    ,NCT01843478
HIV,Immune Activation and Drug Absorption in HIV-Infected Patients, The investigators' objective is to describe the variability of rifampicin absorption markers of inflammation and gut damage intestinal absorptive capacity and intestinal permeability among HIV-infected volunteers. Rifampicin is the least well absorbed of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Rifampicin malabsorption is frequently observed in HIV-infected patients with active tuberculosis but cannot be predicted by patient factors such as CD4+ T cell count viral load or the presence of diarrhea. The mechanisms for rifampicin malabsorption in HIV-infected patients are unknown. An understanding of mechanisms for rifampicin malabsorption could eventually lead to new therapeutic targets with the ultimate goal of improving HIV/tuberculosis treatment outcomes.    ,NCT01845298

PROTOCOL SUMMARY This is a prospective randomized open-label 2 arm 3-phase trial to compare the 48-weeks virological response of two different regimens containing abacavir/lamivudine (abacavir/lamivudine +darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) vs abacavir/lamivudine + raltegravir (RAL) in antiretroviral therapy naive HIV+ individuals presenting for care with CD4+ counts < 200/mm3. 1.1 Clinical Objectives: Primary Objective: To compare the 48-week virological response to two different regimens containing abacavir/lamivudine (abacavir/lamivudine +darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) vs abacavir/lamivudine + raltegravir (RAL) in antiretroviral therapy naive HIV+ individuals presenting for care with CD4+ counts < 200/mm3. Secondary Objective: a) To compare immunological response at 48 weeks; b) To determine the safety and tolerability of the 2 regimens. 1.2 Study population: 350 in/out patients 1.3 Outcome Primary Endpoint   -  Proportion of patients with HIV RNA<50 copies/mL after 48 weeks Secondary Endpoints(s)   -  Change in CD4+ cell count from baseline through week 48   -  Time to virological rebound 1.4 Study design: Multicentre parallel group randomised open label non-inferiority study 1.5 Treatment regimens: Arm A: abacavir/lamivudine 1 tablet once a day + raltegravir 400 mg (1 tablet twice a day) Arm B: abacavir/lamivudine 1 tablet once a day + ritonavir 100 mg + darunavir 800 mg once a day. All drugs have been approved for the treatment of HIV infection. The study population will consist of 350 HIV-positive HLA B5701-negative patients. At baseline patients will be randomized 1:1 to start abacavir/lamivudine plus either raltegravir or darunavir/ritonavir. Randomization will be stratified on the basis of the screening CD4+ cell count (??00 vs ??00 cells/µL) to ensure balance across treatments groups 1.7 Criteria for Safety: Adverse events and laboratory assessments. 1.8 Statistical analysis: As this is a non-inferiority trial we will calculate the difference in the proportions of patients experiencing the primary outcome in the two treatment arms and will calculate a 95% confidence interval for this. Non-inferiority of the raltegravir arm will be demonstrated if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval is greater than -12%. In case non-inferiority will be met analyses for superiority will be performed.    ,NCT01900106

HIV,Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a Human Monoclonal Antibody VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) Administered Intravenously or Subcutaneously to Healthy Adults, Background: - VRC01 is a manmade antibody directed against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Antibodies fight infection. Researchers eventually want to know if VRC01 helps prevent or treat HIV infection. In this study they want to know if the study drug is safe if taken in a vein or under the skin. Taking VRC01 in this study will not protect against HIV infection. Objectives: - To see if VRC01 and placebo are safe and well tolerated. Eligibility: - Healthy adults 18 to 50 years old. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with medical history physical exam and lab tests.   -  Participants will be randomly divided into 4 groups. VRC01 or the placebo will be given in weeks 1 and 4. Blood samples will be taken several times after each VRC01 or placebo dose.   -  Three groups will receive VRC01 by needle into a vein with an IV pump. It will take about 1 hour and it is done in the hospital.   -  One group will receive either VRC01 or the placebo by needle into the fatty tissue under the skin usually the belly. It will take up to 20 minutes and it is done in the hospital.   -  Participants will stay in the hospital overnight after receiving the medication and have about 14 clinic visits over 4 months. Most clinic visits last about 2 hours.   -  Participants will keep a symptom diary after receiving the medicatino.   -  Participants can volunteer to have mouth rectal and genital samples taken throughout the study.   -  The study will last 8 months.    ,NCT01993706
HIV,The Use of Peer Referral Incentives to Increase Demand for Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision in Zambia, The Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) and researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) have partnered to pilot an peer-referral incentive program to increase voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) uptake in Zambia. The program allows each man coming for circumcision to refer up to 5 uncircumcised men in their social network for VMMC services and receive a monetary reward for each successful referral. The peer-referral program offers several advantages over traditional demand-creation approaches that rely on employing mobilizers or community health workers (CHWs). The amount of the monetary incentive will be analogous to the amount of incentive that CHWs might receive for comparable effort making the program suitable for large-scale expansion. The effect of the peer-referral program on uptake of VMMC services will be evaluated using a rigorous methodology proposed by UNC researchers.    ,NCT02012816
HIV,Gonorrhea and Chlamydia HIV-infected Men Who Have Sex With Men, Hypothesis: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at higher risk for sexually transmitted diseases. Currently free testing for sexually transmitted diseases is only being performed in urine samples. Investigators hypothesize that the rates of both gonorrhea and chlamydia will be higher when testing includes more than one anatomical site (rectum and oropharynx). The aim of the study is to estimate the rates of asymptomatic Chlamydia and/or Gonorrhea in the oropharynx rectum and urethra (urine) of HIV infected men who have sex with men at the specialty care center of the University of Nebraska Medical Center and compare to the rates in Douglas County using nucleic acid amplification tests.    ,NCT02019771
HIV,Third Line Antiretroviral Treatment Optimization in Sub-Saharan Africa, Thilao is a multi-country phase 2b non-randomized study in Burkina Faso Cote d'Ivoire Mali and Senegal West Africa. HIV-1 adults with 2nd-line ART virologic failure (plasma HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/ml) will be recruited and followed in two phases:   -  First a 12-week intentive adherence reinforcement phase during which patients will continue 2nd-line ART be seen repeatidly for counseling and educational training on adherence and be offered the possibility of phone SMS and home visit contacts with social workers;   -  Second a 48-week phase during which:   -  Patients successfully resuppressed at the end of the first phase will continue 2nd-line ART and adherence reinforcement;   -  Patients with persitent virologic failure will switch to a darunavir/r + raltegravir-based 3rd-line ART. Genotype resistance tests will be performed retrospectively on frozen samples. The main outcome will be the percentage of patients with plasma HIV-1 viral RNA <50 copies/ml at 64 weeks.    ,NCT02025868
HIV,Microboosting of Atazanavir 300 mg With 50 mg Versus 100mg Ritonavir Daily in HIV-infected Patients: a Pharmacokinetic Study, This is an open-label single group study to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of atazanavir 300 mg daily boosted with ritonavir 100mg daily in HIV-infected patients over a period of 9 days. Ritonavir and atazanavir are protease inhibitors used to treat HIV. However ritonavir when used at low doses (up to 100mg) does not have HIV activity but will enhance (boost) the blood concentrations of other drugs like atazanavir. Recently a study showed that taking 50mg of ritonavir administered in an oral solution led to similar blood concentrations of atazanavir than when given with 100mg of ritonavir. Potential benefits associated with a lower dose of ritonavir may include a reduction of side effects such as upset stomach and an improvement in cholesterol level. This study will look at the amount of atazanavir into your blood when given with ritonavir in a tablet formulation at 50mg or 100mg with standard atazanavir dose (300mg).    ,NCT02034838
HIV,Immunogenicity and Safety of 4 Prime-boost Combinations of HIV Vaccine Candidates in Healthy Volunteers, The development of a safe and effective HIV-1 vaccine strategy would probably be the best solution for the ultimate control of the worldwide AIDS pandemic. Heterologous prime-boost immunisations are today considered promising HIV prophylactic vaccine strategies. It is thus relevant to pursue the development of different candidate vaccines in prime-boost vaccine strategies to identify the most promising prime-boost combinations and to integrate scientific inquiry into trial protocols from the beginning to maximize learning opportunities.    ,NCT02038842
HIV,Safety Tolerability and Immunogenicity Induced by the THV01 Treatment in Patients Infected With HIV-1 Clade B and Treated With Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART)., The objectives of this Phase I/II trial is to evaluate the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of THV01 compared to placebo in HIV-1 infected patients on HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapies). THV01 is composed of two vaccines that derived from the HIV (human immunodeficiency virus): lentiviral vectors. They are non-replicative and not infectious. They will be injected intramuscularly eight weeks apart. Three doses will be assessed and compared to placebo. 36 patients will be enrolled. Eligible patients must have an undetectable viral load and must be treated by HAART for more than 12 months. They will be randomly allocated to one of the study group and will receive the experimental drugs at one of the three doses or a matching placebo. Their anti-HIV treatment will be alleviated around each experimental drugs' administration to enable THV01 efficacy. HAART will be resumed one week after the second injection. 15 weeks after resumption HAART will be interrupted. Patients will then be monitored every 2 weeks for CD4+ T cell counts and viral load as well as for thorough assessment of the elicited immune response. Stringent anti-HIV treatments resumption criteria have been implemented based on the CD4+ T cell counts and the viral load. Statistical analysis will be performed once the last patient has reached his last visit (week 36 or earlier in case of early termination). A long-term follow-up of all enrolled patients will be performed for 5 years post-prime administration. This will provide additional data on the safety on the immune response and the potential long-term risks/benefits associated with THV01.    ,NCT02054286
HIV,Evaluation of Rapid HIV Self-testing Among MSM (eSTAMP), This study seeks to determine the public health impact of providing rapid HIV test kits to men who have sex with men (MSM) so they may test themselves at their convenience. The study will determine if men who receive the rapid HIV test kits report HIV testing at least three times per year. This study will be conducted in four consecutive parts. The first three parts are formative in nature to guide the development and implementation of Part 4 of the study. The research study will use two different types of rapid HIV tests. The OraQuick® In-Home HIV Test for oral fluid (FDA approved for home use) and Sure Check® HIV 1/2 Assay currently FDA-approved for professional use and distributed in the U.S. as Clearview® Complete HIV-1/2 Rapid Test. An Investigational Device Exemption will be obtained from the FDA to allow the contractor to supply the Sure Check® HIV 1/2 Assay to study participants since it is not approved for home use.    ,NCT02067039
HIV,Dolutegravir + Rilpivirine Switch Study (DORISS), The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the capacity of Dolutegravir + Rilpivirine vs. continued triple combination HAART to maintain plasma HIV RNA ??50 copies/ml throughout 24 weeks in patients with plasma HIV RNA ??50 copies/mL for at least 2 years under conventional HAART (2 NNRTI + 3rd agent). The main secondary objectives are the following:   -  % of virologic success (plasma viral load ??50 copies/mL) at W24 and W48   -  % of patients who maintain a plasma viral load ??50 copies / ml from D0 to W48   -  % of virological failure defined by two consecutive plasma viral load > 50 copies/mL   -  Profile of genotypic resistance in case of virological failure. The trial will be conducted according to the design below in 3 steps:   -  Step 1: enrollment of 80 patients (40 in each arm)   -  Step 2: enrollment on hold until W16 data from the 40 patients enrolled in the intervention arm have been analyzed.   -  Step 3: resumption and completion of enrollment if conditions for resuming enrollment at the end of step 2 are fulfilled i.e. if the percentage of patients randomized to the intervention arm who have a plasma viral load ??50 copies/mL from D0 to W16 is significantly > 70% which translates in a maximum of 6 virologic failures.    ,NCT02069834
HIV,Elite Controller and ART-treated HIV+ Statin Versus ASA Treatment Intervention Study, Background: - The immune system protects the body from infection. But it can also cause harm. For example the clotting system makes blood clot and protects from bleeding. But blood clots are sometimes harmful. People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have increased inflammation and clotting. This may increase their risk for diseases like stroke or heart attack. Researchers want to know how aspirin or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (so-called statin medications) affect the immune and clotting systems of people with HIV. Aspirin is a medicine to decrease clotting. Statins are medications given to lower cholesterol and decrease inflammation. Objectives: - To see how aspirin or statins change immune and clotting systems in people with HIV. Eligibility: - Adults 18 and older with HIV and a low viral load not on aspirin or a statin medication. They must also have either: (1) never taken anti-HIV medications (ARVs) have a suppressed viral load have stable CD4 counts and never had an opportunistic infection; or (2) been taking ARVs for 5 continuous years and have a suppressed viral load for more than 3 years. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with medical history physical exam and blood and lab tests.   -  Participants will repeat screening tests and have an MRI. An MRI is a way to visualize blood vessels in the neck and head. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of a cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field.   -  Participants will take either study drug once daily for 9 months.   -  Participants will have a blood procedure twice. Blood will be removed through a needle in one arm and circulated through a machine that removes white blood cells. The blood minus white blood cells is returned through a needle in the other arm.   -  All participants will be observed for 3 months before and after treatment.    ,NCT02081638

HIV,Study of Recovery of Intestinal CD4+ and Th17 T Cells in HIV-infected Individuals on Short-term Antiretroviral Therapy, HIV infection is associated with a state of chronic generalized immune activation that has been shown in many studies to be a key predictor of progression to AIDS. The molecular cellular and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the HIV-associated immune activation are complex and still poorly studied. There is however growing consensus that both viral and host factors contribute to this phenotype with emphasis on the role played by the mucosal immune dysfunction (and consequent microbial translocation). Moreover if it is known that in HIV-infected individuals a severe depletion of intestinal cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T-cells is associated with loss of epithelium integrity microbial translocation and systemic immune activation the kinetics of intestinal CD4+ T-cell reconstitution under combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) remains poorly understood. This study sought to evaluate the reconstitution of intestinal CD4+ T-cells including Th1 and Th17 in blood and colon samples collected from HIV-infected individuals before and after a short term cART.    ,NCT02097381
HIV,Fish Oil for HIV-Related Inflamm-aging and Immune Senescence, HIV infection is associated with premature aging of the immune system. It is believe that the persistent inflammation that accompanies HIV infection is a major contributor to premature immune aging. Fish oil has well-documented anti-inflammatory properties. In this randomized clinical trial we're testing whether a 12-week course of fish oil supplementation will reverse premature aging in HIV-infected older adults.    ,NCT02102724
HIV,Safety of and Immune Response to Vaccination With 2 Experimental HIV Vaccines in Healthy Adults, The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) is doing a study to test 2 experimental HIV vaccines in combination with 2 licensed vaccines for tetanus and hepatitis B. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. Tetanus is an infection that causes muscular spasms. Hepatitis B is a virus that can cause liver failure. About 100 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study. We are doing this study to answer several questions.   -  Are the HIV study vaccines safe to give to people?   -  Are people able to take the HIV study vaccines without becoming too uncomfortable?   -  How do people's immune systems respond to the HIV study vaccines? (Your immune system protects you from disease.)   -  Can people's immune responses to a tetanus or hepatitis B vaccines help us understand how their immune systems might respond to the HIV study vaccines?   -  Is there a common immune response to licensed vaccines like the tetanus and hepatitis B vaccines?    ,NCT02109354

HIV,Serological Response to Antipneumococcal Vaccination and Impact on Streptococcus Pneumoniae Nasal Carriage in HIV Adults, S. pneumoniae is frequently isolated from nasal swabs of healthy subjects but it can also cause severe diseases (pneumonia bacteraemia meningitis and sepsis).HIV-infected subjects are more sensitive to invasive diseases and recurrent infection than the general population. Nasal carriage is the main pathogenetic feature for invasive disease: bacteraemia is more frequent in carriers HIV+ patients are constantly colonized by the same pneumococcal strain and their nasopharyngeal isolates have features similar to subsequent invasive strains. A 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) has long been available and recommended in the HIV+ population as prophylaxis for invasive disease. Studies regarding efficacy of PPV23 in HIV+ are controversial and highlight that immune response induced by PPV23 in HIV+ is poor and an hyporesponsiveness to repeated polysaccaridic antigens stimulation can occur. Moreover PPV23 seems not to affect pneumococcal carriage status and could lead to emergence of non-vaccine serotypes. The conjugation of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides to carrier proteins results in an improved T-cell dependent immune response characterized by increased antibody concentrations and induction of T and B memory cells with a demonstrated higher efficacy in children. A heptavalent vaccine conjugated with diphtheria toxoid (PCV7) is approved in Europe since 2001 and is effective in reducing incidence of invasive disease by vaccine serotypes (4 6B 9V 14 18C 19F 23F) in both children and adults due to effect of herd immunity. A PCV13 formulation has recently been developed covering PCV7 serotypes plus 1 3 5 6A 7F and 19A. PCV13 revealed the same safety profile as PCV7 in pediatric patients that are the main target of conjugate vaccines licensure. Some trials showed a better antibody response in terms of quantity and quality in HIV + adults by using PCV7 as compared to PPV23. However these data were not unequivocally confirmed in further studies on the use of PCV7 alone or in combination with PPV23. The first trials of PCV13 use in adults showed the same or even better response compared to PPV23 with a safety and tolerability similar to PCV7. PCV13 in HIV+ adults is a promising candidate prophylactic measure for pneumococcal infections. The purpose of this study is to evaluate serological response and prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization by S. pneumoniae in HIV+ non-hospitalized adults following vaccination with 2 doses of PCV13.    ,NCT02123433
HIV,Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Reformulated Raltegravir (MK-0518) 1200 mg Once Daily in Combination With TRUVADA??in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 Infected Treatment-Naive Participants (MK-0518-292), To evaluate the safety and efficacy of reformulated raltegravir (MK-0518) 1200 mg once daily in combination with TRUVADA??versus raltegravir 400 mg twice daily in combination with TRUVADA??in HIV-1 infected treatment-naive participants. The primary hypothesis being tested is that reformulated raltegravir 1200 mg once-daily is non-inferior to raltegravir 400 mg twice-daily each in combination therapy with TRUVADA??as assessed by the proportion of participants achieving HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) <40 copies/mL at Week 48.    ,NCT02131233
HIV,Erlotinib Hydrochloride in Treating Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That is Metastatic or Cannot be Removed by Surgery in Patients With HIV Infection, This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of erlotinib hydrochloride in treating non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Erlotinib hydrochloride is a standard drug used for treating lung cancer however it is not yet known whether it is safe to give erlotinib hydrochloride to patients who also have HIV infection or not.    ,NCT02134886
HIV,Asha Improving Health and Nutrition of Indian Women With AIDS and Their Children, Building upon the successful qualitative Phase I of the study Phase II commences in month 10. The Project manager and research staff will recruit 600 women living with AIDS (WLA) and their oldest child between the ages of 3 and 8. The WLA will be recruited from Primary Health Centers (PHCs) randomly selected from 72 closest PHCs in terms of HIV prevalence in the rural Andhra Pradesh (AP) area of Nellore. WLA will be recruited by means of approved flyers posted in selected PHCs. Interested WLA will approach the research staff stationed at the PHC to be screened for eligibility via a consent script. Once eligibility is determined for the WLA based upon the following criteria: age HIV and ART status (validated by ART and HIV card); having a child (3-8 years) and whether or not the WLA was a participant of the previous intervention group from the Asha pilot study a parental consent will be obtained from the WLA for permission to include her oldest child in the study. The oldest child between 3-8 years of age will be brought in to the research office or PHC (after mother speaks with the child at home). All children will have blood work drawn and physical health assessment on their first visit (total of 15 minutes). All eligible WLA will undergo a second consent for enrollment. General Procedure: Following informed consent the WLA will be randomly assigned into one of four programs 1) Asha Support Only; 2) Asha Support + Training; 3) Asha Support + Food; or 4) Asha Support + Training + Food. After blood draw and physical assessment of the WLA an appointment will be made for the assigned interviewer (blinded to program) to visit the WLA at their home preferably (or other location of choice) to conduct several 24 hour dietary assessments. Urine will be collected in labeled bottles on the morning after the 3rd day of the diet recall by the interviewer and sent directly to the lab in a cooler. Also on the same day the baseline assessment will be entered into the PC tablets; 50 minutes estimated with breaks). After a longer break the WLA will then be asked to respond to additional questions about the sociodemographic and psychomotor development of their child (about 30 minutes). Interviewers will visit the WLA monthly until the end of the intervention (month 6) to provide individual weekly Asha Support and conduct group sessions and collect ongoing data 24-hour recall and ART pill count for WLA and follow up questionnaires at 6- 12- and 18-months.    ,NCT02136082

HIV,Demonstrating Safety and Effective Delivery of Daily Oral Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for Sex Workers in India, Female sex workers (FSWs) in India are at high risk of HIV infection and while correct and consistent condom use is an effective means of preventing HIV transmission many FSWs have difficulty insisting on their use. Alternative HIV prevention options are needed for FSWs who are unable to correctly and consistently use condoms with their clients or regular partners. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be an important tool to fill this critical prevention gap and a demonstration project is required to assess the impact and feasibility of the use of PrEP as an HIV prevention intervention among most at risk FSWs in India. The proposed project will take place at two sites in India and will assess the use of a risk assessment tool to identify FSWs who would most benefit from PrEP collect information about the reasons why FSWs choose to accept or decline PrEP evaluate two different PrEP delivery strategies (weekly clinic pick-up or home delivery by peer educators every second day) monitor adherence to and discontinuation of PrEP and evaluate unintended consequences of the use of PrEP in these communities (e.g. reduction of condom use drug side effects or adverse events social harms or resistance). To ensure the safety of study participants a community advisory board will be set up and will meet regularly to inform study staff of any concerns that the community may have related to the study so that the study staff can respond in a timely manner. A data safety and monitoring board will also be established to monitor participant safety.    ,NCT02148094

Monoclonal antibodies such as brentuximab vedotin can block cancer growth by finding cancer cells and causing them to die. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as doxorubicin hydrochloride vinblastine sulfate and dacarbazine work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving brentuximab vedotin together with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.    ,NCT02298257
HIV,Study of Cell Phone SMS to Improve Adherence to ART in HIV Positive Young Women, There has been increasing use of technology in delivery of healthcare and increasing use of cellular phone and text messaging services to help with various healthcare related issues including but not limited to medication adherence and clinic attendance. Mobile phones technology has been used for healthcare delivery and prevention strategies such as smoking cessation. In the present era cell phones have become part of daily life for most people even among those in lower economic groups. There have also been several studies looking at cell phone text messaging services to improve adherence to ART among HIV infected subjects but no studies have so far been done in HIV infected young women to help retention and adherence to care. The overall goal of this study is to evaluation of the impact of texting intervention to improve adherence to care and treatment in HIV infected young women. Study Hypothesis: Text message intervention will improve adherence to ART in HIV infected young women.    ,NCT02301507
HIV,A Retrospective Analysis of Raltegravir Use in Minority HIV Infected Women in Houston Texas, Raltegravir is the first marketed strand-transfer inhibitor of HIV-1 that was FDA approved in 2007. It is currently one of the preferred treatment regimens for HIV by the Department of Health and Human Services. It has become a widely used antiretroviral therapy option for HIV infected patients. It provides good tolerability and a favorable lipid profile for patients when compared to some other antiretroviral treatment options. Little data is reported about efficacy in a minority patient population. Moreover data in an indigent minority population in the United States has not been aggregated before. Therefore this study will investigate the efficacy of raltegravir in minority women residing in Houston TX who are HIV infected.    ,NCT02302950
HIV,Improving Outcomes With Metformin, HCV antiviral therapy has evolved rapidly in recent years and access to these medications has improved. While SVR is associated with improved liver outcomes the rate of liver fibrosis regression with SVR is variable and predictors of regression are not well established. In addition achieving SVR in patients with cirrhosis does not necessarily prevent decompensation or eliminate the risk of HCC. A better understanding of the role insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism have on these outcomes in HCV patients who achieve SVR are needed. Identifying and targeting potentially modifiable risk factors such as IR may be of significant importance in preventing progression of and promoting regression of liver fibrosis reducing mortality and improving outcomes for HCV-HIV co-infected and HCV-mono-infected patients. This proposed pilot study will be the first to evaluate the role of Metformin on liver fibrosis in HCV-HIV co-infected and HCV mono-infected patients with IR receiving DAA HCV treatment. If Metformin is effective in reducing liver fibrosis in this patient population this will represent a well-tolerated easy to administer inexpensive therapy that will protect against negative HCV outcomes. This study will also be an opportunity to evaluate the impact of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia have on viral clearance HCV-infected patients treated with interferon-free regimens. In addition the study will further explore the relationship between HCV insulin resistance and AFP levels.    ,NCT02306070

These genetically modified stem cells may help the body make cells that are resistant to HIV infection.    ,NCT02343666
HIV,Glutathione and Function in HIV Patients, We have recently reported that older patients with HIV are deficient in glutathione (GSH) due to decreased availability of cysteine and glycine and that oral supplementation with cysteine (as n-acetylcysteine) and glycine for 2-weeks corrects their own levels and improves (but does not fully normalize) concentrations of red-cell GSH. We also found that when GSH deficient subjects had impaired mitochondrial fuel oxidation and this improved with an increase in intracellular GSH concentrations. These older HIV patients also had significant increases in muscle strength with improvement of GSH levels.The current proposal in older HIV patients will investigate study if cysteine and glycine supplementation for a duration of 12 weeks will result in changes in : (a) GSH levels; (b) body composition/anthropometry; (c) strength and function; (d) quality of life; (e) mitochondrial energetics; (f) biochemistry (including dyslipidemia and oxidative stress); (g) protein and glucose metabolism; (h) cognition and memory. After completing supplementation for 3 months GSH concentrations strength function mitochondrial energetics and neurocognitive tests will be measured for a further 2 months to determine the effects of washout.    ,NCT02348775

HIV,Life Course HIV and Hepatitis B Among African Migrants Living in Ile-de-France, Populations from Sub-Saharan Africa represent one of the most dynamic immigration flows in France and are among the most exposed to HIV infection and hepatitis B. The Parcours study aims to understand among sub-Saharan African migrants how social and individual factors combine in the course of migration and settlement in France and influence the risk of infection access to prevention and care and the effectiveness of care for both HIV and hepatitis B diseases. The research was conducted in Ile-de-France where 60% of sub-Saharan African migrants reside. It consists in a cross-sectional observational survey using a life-event history approach that reproduces the sequence of different life and health events and contributes to explain the present situation (type of disease management patient's quality of life) in light of all the elements of the past trajectory (administrative familial socio-economic professionals). A representative survey was conducted between February 2012 and May 2013 in health care facilities in Ile-de-France among three groups of migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa: a group living with HIV a group living with chronic hepatitis B and a group who has neither of these diseases. For each group stratified random sampling was used. The survey was conducted in 24 hospital services providing HIV care 20 health care facilities providing hepatitis B care and 30 primary health care facilities. Were eligible all patients attending these health care facilities born in a Sub-Saharan African country and with Sub-Saharan African citizenship at birth aged 18 to 59 years with an HIV diagnosis (HIV group) or chronic hepatitis B diagnosis (hepatitis B group) more than three months prior or not diagnosed with HIV or chronic Hepatitis B (reference group). Among the patients offered participation 926 HIV-infected patients 779 patients infected by hepatitis B and 763 patients without these two diseases participated in the study. For all participants detailed information on socio-demographic characteristics; migration and life conditions in France; social sexual and reproductive life history; and screening and care history were collected using a life-event history questionnaire administered face-to-face by a specialized interviewer. Health care professionals documented clinical information from the medical records. Data was collected anonymously.    ,NCT02566148

HIV,Metformin Immunotherapy in HIV Infection, Anti-HIV drugs cut down the number of serious infections that people with HIV get. However some subjects taking anti-HIV drugs do not achieve adequate cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) recovery and decrease in elevated cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) cells. Such patients with a low CD4/CD8 ratio remain at risk for developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and non-AIDS-related complications. Two of the most important factors associated with low CD4/CD8 ratio include: the persistence of HIV on ART and inflammation. Metformin the most widely used medication to treat type 2 diabetes is well tolerated with minimal side effects. It has been linked to anti-aging and weight reducing properties in non-diabetic persons. Because of its ability to improve immune functions metformin could be a promising addition to ART in HIV patients. It is also reported to change the composition of microbes in the gut which may improve inflammation. PURPOSES OF THE STUDY The purposes of this study are to find out if:   1. metformin can be combined with anti-HIV drugs to reduce the amount of hidden virus in the body;   2. metformin can be combined with anti-HIV drugs to improve immune function.   3. metformin can be combined with anti-HIV drugs to impact CD4 T cell count and CD4/CD8 T cell ratio during treatment and after its discontinuation   4. metformin can change the composition of the bacteria in the gut which may improve inflammation. For this purpose the investigators will add metformin at the usual antidiabetic dose for 12 weeks for patients receiving stable ART having a CD4/CD8 ratio below 0.7. Approximately 22 participants will be enrolled in this study at the Chronic Viral Illness Service of the McGill University Health Centre the Ottawa Hospital and the Maple Leaf Medical Clinic (Toronto). This study will last about 24 weeks; metformin treatment will be for 12 weeks. In order to be eligible for the study the participants must be 18 years of age or older have an undetectable viral load (the quantity of the HIV virus in the blood must be less than 50 copies/ml) for at least 3 months and have a CD4/CD8 ratio of less than 0.7. All participants will also be asked to give blood and stool samples and optional colon mucosal biopsy samples (before and after metformin supplementation) to study the size of the viral reservoir and the amount of T cell activation and changes in gut microbiota composition.    ,NCT02659306
HIV,My Smart Age With HIV: Smartphone Self-assessment of Frailty, Understanding the complexity of aging and frailty in chronic HIV infection motivated Italian team members to begin to build a frailty index (FI) including 37 health variables at the Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic (MHMC). The validation of FI in HIV patients have been recently published and more data comparing FI in HIV infected vs un-infected people have been presented at international meeting and are at present submitted for publication. The research consortium (MHMC HCC and HHMP) of this study was motivated to begin preliminary work in consideration of the similar multidisciplinary approach in Ageing care and capacity to address health status in ageing HIV patients using shared definitions of co-morbidities multi-morbidity and measures of Physical Function and Cognition impairment disability and quality of life. The investigators wanted to overcome the major criticism intrinsic in the FI that is the needs to collects many variables not easily available in most HIV centres. The the investigators approach is to make patient living with HIV (PLWH) be the source of health variables taking advantage of information and communication technologies available with smart phones and fitness tracking device collecting physiological parameters and patient related outcomes.    ,NCT02663856
HIV,Aging With HIV at Younger vs Older Age: a Diverse Population With Distinct Comorbidity Profiles, Clinical hypotheses: The increasing number of people aging with HIV is a matter of fact. Differences in prevalence of comorbidities between the general population and HIV-positive patients are mainly driven by duration of HIV infection rather than chronological age of HIV+ patients. People aging with HIV display heterogeneous health conditions. Host factors and duration of HIV infection are associated with increased risk of MM independently from chronological age and these factors are responsible of the prevalence difference of comorbidities and MM in comparison to the general population. Objectives: The study objective is to assess the prevalence of and risk factors for individual co-morbidities and multi morbidity (MM) between HIV-positive patients with similar duration of HIV infection but 30 years difference. We compared estimates across both groups to a matched community-based cohort sampled from the general population.    ,NCT02663869

HIV,Same-day ART Initiation Versus Standard of Care After Positive HIV-test Result in Rural Lesotho, The CASCADE-trial is a two-armed open-label randomized controlled trial conducted in rural Lesotho. Participants who were tested HIV-positive during community-based HIV testing and counseling campaigns are randomized to the intervention or control arm. Allocation is 1:1 with parallel assignment. Participants in the control arm follow the standard of care after a community-based HIV test result: They are referred to the nearest clinic where they will receive baseline laboratory testing and adherence counseling. After at least 2 clinic visits for adherence counseling they can start anti-retroviral therapy (ART). After ART-initiation they have to attend monthly follow-up at the clinic for drug refill. Individuals randomized to the intervention arm are proposed same day community-based ART initiation combined with less frequent follow-up visits. The primary outcomes are linkage to care at 3 months and viral suppression at 12 months after having tested HIV-positive during the community-based HIV testing and counseling campaigns.    ,NCT02692027

HIV,TransPrEP: Social Network-Based PrEP Adherence for Transgender Women in Peru, The investigators propose a social network-based PrEP adherence intervention as part of a comprehensive context-specific approach to HIV prevention for TW in Lima Peru. In order to be effective PrEP-based prevention strategies need to address not only biological efficacy but also individual behavioral decision-making processes interpersonal partnership contexts of risk peer norms of sexual behavior and PrEP adherence and structural access to prevention technologies. Using a health promotion behavioral model that combines Social Action Theory with social network theories of information dissemination and collective behavior change the investigators propose to develop and refine a network-based intervention that promotes PrEP adherence in the existing social networks of TW. Formative research will outline individual partner-level and network-based contexts of sexual risk behavior patterns of social network interactions anticipated adoption and use of new prevention technologies and optimal content for a PrEP adherence intervention. Findings will be used to define the elements of a prevention intervention using social networks of TW and social media technologies to generate implement and reinforce social norms of PrEP adherence and risk behavior reduction for TW.    ,NCT02710032

HIV,Modulating the Impact of Critical Events in Early HIV Infection: Effect of ART Initiation and Alcohol Use," The overall objective is to determine the influence of timing of ART initiation and alcohol consumption on HIV disease course including detailed analysis of important events occurring shortly after HIV acquisition. ART initiation immediately after HIV infection (during Fiebig stages I-II) largely results in smaller HIV reservoir and lower HIV-associated systemic inflammation which has been linked to non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. Immediate ART also reduces HIV-associated bacterial translocation and may prevent dysbiosis an alteration of the intestinal microbiota that has been linked to increased systemic inflammation. Immediate intervention is not however generally feasible and more information is required about the consequences of starting ART at later time-points but still early after acquisition. The proposed study will be conducted in Lima Peru in the cohort of 180 MSM with acute (Ab- HIV RNA+) or recent (??3 months) HIV infection. Alcohol use disorder is present in ~50% of HIV-infected MSM in our cohort which is four times higher than that seen among males in the general Peruvian population. Although the role of alcohol use in HIV pathogenesis and disease course remains unclear some studies show a correlation with accelerated disease progression. In animal models and clinical studies both acute and chronic alcohol consumption have been linked to bacterial translocation and activation of the innate immune system which can lead to increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines. The effects of alcohol resemble early post-infection changes in bacterial translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by HIV and their impact on HIV disease course before and after ART initiation remain unexplored. Specific Aim 1: To determine the relative long-term benefits of immediate vs. early vs. delayed ART initiation. The investigators will study outcomes after 1.5 and 3.5 years in MSM diagnosed with acute or recent HIV infection. The investigators will examine outcomes in 3 groups based on time of ART initiation: a) immediate: during FI-II (N~30) b) early: during FIII-V (N~50) or c) delayed: at 24 weeks after diagnosis (N~80). The investigators anticipate that CD4+ T cell counts and peripheral inflammatory markers in the FIII-V group and the delayed group will approach those in the immediate treatment group (FI-II) over time; in contrast they expect that those started ART at ""early"" or ""delayed"" time points will have persistent changes in the GI microbiome and in the HIV reservoir. Specific Aim 2: To determine the impact of alcohol use on the relative long-term benefits of immediate vs. early vs. delayed initiation of ART. The investigators will examine the impact of alcohol use on critical events in HIV infection. They hypothesize that dose-dependent alcohol-induced changes will compound the negative effects of HIV and lead to greater levels of dysbiosis and inflammation higher early plasma HIV RNA and greater ""seeding"" and persistence of HIV DNA in participants with high-level alcohol use. The investigators will assess viral load GI microbiome and metagenomics pro-inflammatory cytokines production of msRNA and analyze the impact on alcohol use in all subjects prior to ART initiation and among ART-adherent participants with persistent viral suppression.

HIV,Folinic Acid: Supplementation and Therapy, Patients infected by HIV or HIV-HCV coinfected have higher survival due to the use of HAART but survival is accompanied by increased morbidity and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). Endothelial dysfunction is an early marker of atherogenesis acting as an intermediate in the causal pathway of CVD. Folinic acid (FA) has been shown to reduce CVD outcomes especially among individuals with hyperhomocisteinemia. To date few studies provided consistent information about efficacy of pharmacological interventions that minimize damage to the vascular endothelium in patients infected by HIV or HIV-HCV coinfected. The main hypothesis of this study is that FA supplementation protects the vascular endothelium and consequently might prevent subclinical atherosclerosis. Thus the first step is to determine the efficacy of supplementation with FA and to compare the effect between HIV and HIV-HCV coinfected.    ,NCT02810275

HIV,Growing Up: Intervening With HIV-Positive Adolescents in Resource-Poor Settings, Despite overall declines in HIV incidence and mortality since ART scale-up in low and middle income countries both have risen among youth. In addition HIV-infected youth achieve inferior treatment outcomes compared to their adult counterparts in both high- and low-income countries and these poorer outcomes are generally attributed to suboptimal adherence. Thus there is a critical need for the development of adherence and risk reduction interventions for the growing cohort of these youth and the proposed cognitive behavioral N'ap Grandi is one such intervention.    ,NCT02921516
HIV,Study of Single IV Administration of P2G12, A randomised placebo controlled phase I trial of a monoclonal antibody which neutralises HIV-1 (P2G12) to be given as a single intravenous infusion to healthy human volunteers to assess the safety and reactogenicity    ,NCT02923999
HIV,Adding Maraviroc to the HAART Regimen of Well Controlled HIV-infected Patients, Many patients on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) are able to achieve a sustained response with viral loads becoming undetectable and staying undetectable but do not have an increase in their CD4 counts to levels greater than 500. Adding maraviroc to the treatment regimen of these patients may result in an increase in their CD4 counts. As the patient would be continuing their prior regimen they will likely continue with full control of viral replication.    ,NCT02934022
HIV,Social Norms and Priming to Improve Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy and Retention in Care, Interventions incorporating constructs from behavioral economics and psychology have the potential to enhance HIV 'treatment as prevention' (TasP) strategies. To test this hypothesis the investigators evaluated a combination intervention to improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence based on the concepts of social norms and priming.    ,NCT02938533
HIV,A Clinical Trial of the Safety Pharmacokinetics and Antiviral Activity of PGT121 Monoclonal Antibody (mAb) in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected Adults, This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and anti-viral efficacy of the PGT121 monoclonal antibody for HIV prevention and therapy.    ,NCT02960581
HIV,Microbiota Restoration Therapy in HIV With Repeated Low-Dose Interventions, Altered interplay between gut mucosa and dysbiotic bacteria during HIV infection seems to contribute to chronic immune dysfunction. Manipulation of the intestinal microbiota with nutritional interventions exert limited immunologic effects but a deep understanding of how these interventions could ameliorate gut dysbiosis and influence health among HIV-infected individuals remain unexplored. In this Phase I clinical trial 30 HIV-infected subjects on effective ART with evidence of persistent immune dysfunction indicated by a CD4/CD8 ratio<1 will be included and randomized to either repeated low-dose oral fecal microbiota transplantation or placebo during 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be safety. Secondary outcomes will include changes in CD4+ T cell counts CD8+ T cell counts CD4/CD8 ratio inflammatory markers T cell activation and markers of enterocyte barrier function through week 48. Engraftment on host microbiota will be examined using Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 16S RNA and changes in bacterial metabolism and in the plasma metabolite fingerprint will be studied by combination of untargeted mass spectrometry and two different and complementary separation techniques in bacterial and plasma samples.    ,NCT03008941

HIV,Synbiotics in Advanced HIV Infection, Late diagnosed HIV-infected subjects show impaired immunological recovery resulting in a greater risk of clinical progression. Gut bacteria metabolism appears to impact immune recovery in HIV-infected subjects and while nutritional interventions with prebiotics and probiotics seem to exert immunological effects the clinical implications in this key population remain unknown. This is a pilot multicenter randomized placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial in HIV-infected ART-naive subjects with <350 CD4 T cells/mm3 or AIDS. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to either the synbiotic nutritional supplement PMT25341 or placebo for 48 weeks each in combination with first-line ART. Primary outcomes will be safety and immunological recovery. Secondary outcomes will include changes in fecal microbiota structure and plasma inflammatory markers.    ,NCT03009032

HIV,A Phase I Trial of Intranasal Peptide T: Safety Toxicity and Pharmacokinetics in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Infected Patients., To study the safety and toxicity of intranasal peptide T (D-Ala-1-peptide-T-amide) in humans and to find out how quickly and how much of a given dose enters the bloodstream and how quickly it leaves the bloodstream. To obtain information on the ability of intranasal peptide T to prevent halt and/or reverse the effects of AIDS on the central nervous system. Studies have shown that AIDS is caused by a retrovirus. This virus works by inactivating or destroying human CD4 cells (which are part of the human immune system). This in turn leads to the observed immunologic defects and related illnesses including HIV encephalopathy (disease of the brain). One method of preventing AIDS is to prevent HIV from entering the cell. HIV binds to the receptor CD4 site. Peptide T also binds to this site and thus by competing for that site can block the binding of the virus to its receptor. Preliminary animal and human studies indicate that peptide T is safe at the doses selected for this trial. Thirty patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) are entered into the study to receive an increasing schedule of three dosage levels of intranasal peptide T for 12 - 16 weeks followed by a 1-month off-drug follow-up period and a subsequent 1-month return to the drug. All patients receive an initial intravenous test dose of peptide T. The test dose is administered over 1 hour followed by an observation period of 8 hours in the outpatient clinic.    ,NCT00000391
HIV,Phase II Study of the Efficacy of Peptide T in HIV-Positive Individuals With Cognitive Impairment., To evaluate the chemical efficacy and safety of intranasally administered peptide T on neurocognitive function in HIV seropositive individuals. Previous studies have shown that treatment with peptide T can result in cognitive improvement in HIV-infected patients. Patients are randomized to receive either peptide T or placebo for the first 6 months. All patients then receive open-label peptide T for approximately 6 additional months. Neuropsychologic tests are used to determine drug effects.    ,NCT00000392
HIV,A Phase I Trial of Peptide T: Efficacy for the Neuropsychiatric Complications of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)., To study the safety toxicology and activity of Peptide T (D-Ala-1-peptide-T-amide) in humans and to find out more about the ability of peptide T to prevent halt and/or reverse AIDS-associated immunologic disturbances. Recent information suggests that the central nervous system (CNS) is often impaired in HIV-infected individuals. The dysfunction of the CNS may be either a direct or an indirect result of HIV infection. One method to prevent HIV infection is to block entry of the virus into the cells of the body. Peptide T shows laboratory evidence of blocking the entrance of HIV into cells that are susceptible to HIV infection. Studies that have been done indicate that peptide T is nontoxic in the doses that are used in this study. AIDS patients with minimal (group 1) or moderate (group 2) cognitive dysfunction (mental impairment) receive an increasing schedule of three dosage levels of peptide T. All patients receive an intravenous (IV) dose of peptide T for 10 days followed by the intermediate dose and then the highest dose each intravenously for 10 days. Following successful completion of 3 IV doses four patients participate in an intranasal pharmacokinetic (blood level study) dosage trial of 3 doses (different from IV) of peptide T once for each of 3 successive days. Follow-up continues for up to 1 year.    ,NCT00000393

HIV,Phase II Study of Filgrastim (G-CSF) Plus ABVD in the Treatment of HIV-Associated Hodgkin's Disease, Primary: To assess the toxicity of chemotherapy with ABVD (doxorubicin / bleomycin / vinblastine / dacarbazine) when given with filgrastim ( granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF ) in patients with underlying HIV infection and Hodgkin's disease; to observe the efficacy of ABVD and G-CSF in reducing tumor burden in HIV-infected patients with Hodgkin's disease. Secondary: To determine the durability of tumor response to ABVD plus G-CSF over the 2-year study period; to observe the incidence of bacterial and opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients with Hodgkin's disease receiving this regimen; to document quality of life of patients receiving this regimen. Addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may prevent neutropenia caused by chemotherapy allowing more timely administration of chemotherapy and improved response.    ,NCT00000626
HIV,Pilot Study to Determine the Feasibility of Fluconazole for Induction Treatment and Suppression of Relapse of Histoplasmosis in Patients With the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, To evaluate the use of fluconazole as (1) induction therapy in histoplasmosis (2) maintenance therapy to prevent relapse of histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Fluconazole is a triazole antifungal agent that has been used successfully in the treatment of experimental histoplasmosis in animals but has not been completely evaluated in patients for this use. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for certain other fungal infections. Nevertheless physicians are prescribing it to their patients with histoplasmosis. This is a pilot study to examine the role of fluconazole for treating histoplasmosis in AIDS patients.    ,NCT00000627

HIV,The Effects of Valproic Acid on Zidovudine Glucuronidation and Pharmacokinetics in HIV-Infected Patients., Primary objective: To study the pharmacokinetic interaction between zidovudine (AZT) and valproic acid in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients characterizing AZT's oral bioavailability plasma elimination half-time plasma levels and urinary excretion of AZT 5'-O-glucuronide (GAZT) and 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine (AMT). Secondary objective: To establish the safety of short-term administration of AZT and valproic acid in combination with regard to hematologic parameters and liver function in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients. Preliminary studies using human liver tissue have shown that valproic acid inhibits the metabolic inactivation of zidovudine (AZT) which may prolong the plasma half-life of AZT and thus prolong the duration of the drug's effects in the body.    ,NCT00000629
HIV,Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Vaccinia-HIV Envelope Recombinant Vaccine (HIVAC-1e) in Combination With Soluble Recombinant Envelope Vaccine (gp160; VaxSyn), To determine if priming (giving the first vaccination) with a vaccinia recombinant (HIVAC-1e) provides a significant advantage in immunogenicity (production of antibodies) compared to priming with a soluble recombinant protein (gp160); to learn more about the safety of the combination use of the two HIV envelope vaccines utilized in the study. Recent studies at the AIDS vaccine units have shown the safety of two candidate HIV vaccines HIVAC-1e and gp160. Specific questions to be addressed in this part of the study include: Does combination vaccination result in a synergistic (added) response not predicted by just the addition of a second vaccination and does this synergism depend on the unique priming effect of a vaccinia recombinant or will any combination do?    ,NCT00000630
HIV,A Phase I Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccinia-HIV Envelope Recombinant Vaccine (HIVAC-1e) in Combination With Soluble Recombinant Envelope Vaccine (VaxSyn), Primary: To determine whether additional boosting with soluble recombinant gp160 vaccine (VaxSyn) after priming with a vaccinia-HIV envelope recombinant (HIVAC-1e) provides a significant advantage in the degree and duration of immunogenicity. Secondary: To learn more about the safety of the combination use of the two HIV envelope vaccines in the study (VaxSyn and HIVAC-1e). Recent Phase I trials conducted at the AIDS Vaccine Units have shown that antibodies have persisted in most recipients for 6 months after boosting and responses seem significantly higher and more persistent than responses achieved by just two doses of soluble protein vaccine alone or two doses of HIVAC-1e alone. This study tests in a previously recruited cohort of volunteers whether additional boosting with soluble recombinant gp160 results in increased immunogenicity of longer duration.    ,NCT00000631
HIV,A Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 100 mcg of Env 2-3 in MF59, To evaluate the safety and immune response of 100 mcg Env 2-3 antigen administered on days 0 30 180 and 365. Preliminary immunologic data from protocol VEU 005B show evidence of the development of functional antibodies in the form of increased peptide binding and development of neutralizing antibodies. Evaluation of an antigen dose having potentially greater immunogenicity is therefore of particular interest.    ,NCT00000632
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Immuno-AG Recombinant HIV gp160 in Asymptomatic HIV Seropositive Individuals, To determine the safety and immunogenicity of vaccinia-derived HIV-1 recombinant envelope glycoprotein (gp160) in asymptomatic HIV-infected adult volunteers. To compare safety and immunogenicity of two different schedules of gp160 administration. To examine the effects of gp160 and hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) on various markers of viral load and on selected immune parameters. Potentiation of a patient's immune response to HIV might possibly prolong the period of clinical latency and protect the patient indefinitely. Preliminary results from a study of Immuno-AG recombinant gp160 vaccine in healthy volunteers not infected with HIV suggest that the vaccine is safe and produces antibodies against the virus. Because another previous study failed to demonstrate a specific anti-HIV response in patients injected with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing HIV-1 genes this study is also testing the immunotherapeutic role of other immunizations (such as hepatitis B vaccination) that would be expected to induce a nonspecific immune response in HIV-infected persons.    ,NCT00000633
HIV,A Pilot Pharmacokinetic Phase I Evaluation of BI-RG-587 in HIV-Infected Children, To generate initial information on the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and dose proportionality of nevirapine (BI-RG-587) plasma levels in HIV-infected children; to assess the safety and tolerance of single rising oral doses of nevirapine in HIV-infected children; and to confirm that the single doses that achieve certain plasma levels in adults achieve similar levels in HIV-infected children. Test tube studies have shown that nevirapine (BI-RG-587) inhibits replication (reproduction) of HIV. Nevirapine works with zidovudine (AZT) and is active against strains of the virus that are resistant to AZT. Studies of the drug in HIV-infected adults showed no serious adverse effects.    ,NCT00000634
HIV,Prophylaxis Against Tuberculosis (TB) in Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection and Confirmed Latent Tuberculous Infection, To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of a 2-month regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide versus a 1-year course of isoniazid (INH) to prevent the development of tuberculosis in patients who are coinfected with HIV and latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb). Current guidelines recommend 6 to 12 months of treatment with INH for purified protein derivative (PPD)-positive individuals. Problems with this treatment include compliance adverse reaction and the possibility of not preventing disease due to INH-resistant organisms. Studies suggest that two or three months of rifampin and pyrazinamide may be more effective than longer courses of INH. A two-month prevention course should help to increase compliance. In addition the use of two drugs (rifampin and pyrazinamide) may help overcome problems with drug resistance.    ,NCT00000636
HIV,A Randomized Comparative Trial of Zidovudine (AZT) Versus 2'3'-Dideoxyinosine (ddI) Versus AZT Plus ddI in Symptomatic HIV-Infected Children, To compare the effectiveness of treatment with zidovudine (AZT) compared to didanosine (ddI) and compared to the combination of AZT and ddI as determined by survival and disease progression. To compare the relative safety and tolerance of AZT versus ddI versus AZT plus ddI in symptomatic HIV infected children; to compare the virological and immunological parameters in the three treatment groups. AZT has been shown to delay the progression of AIDS in HIV infected individuals. However bone marrow toxicity is a frequent adverse effect. Also HIV resistance to AZT sometimes occurs in patients who initially respond to treatment but later have progression of the disease. Thus new drug treatments are needed. Studies of ddI in adults and children indicate some effectiveness of the drug. A direct comparison of AZT and ddI treatment in children has not been made. Combination antiviral treatment (AZT plus ddI) may give added therapeutic benefit to children.    ,NCT00000637
HIV,Preventive Treatment Against Tuberculosis (TB) in Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection and Confirmed Latent Tuberculous Infection, To evaluate and compare the safety and effectiveness of a one-year course of isoniazid (INH) versus a two-month course of rifampin plus pyrazinamide for the prevention of reactivation tuberculosis in individuals infected with both HIV and latent (inactive) Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Current guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control recommend 6 to 12 months of INH for PPD (purified protein derivative)-positive individuals. Although the effectiveness of this treatment is not known for HIV-infected individuals several studies using INH to prevent tuberculosis in presumably normal hosts have shown 60 to 80 percent effectiveness. Problems with this treatment include compliance adverse reaction and the possibility of not preventing disease due to tuberculosis organisms being resistant to INH. A two-month preventive treatment plan should help in increasing compliance. In addition the use of two drugs (rifampin / pyrazinamide) may help overcome problems with drug resistance. If this study shows equal or greater effectiveness of the two-month rifampin / pyrazinamide treatment it could alter the approach to tuberculosis prevention for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals.    ,NCT00000638
HIV,A Phase I Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Recombinant CD4 Immunoglobulin G (rCD4-IgG) in HIV-1 Seropositive Women During the Last Trimester of Pregnancy and Their Newborns, Part 1: To determine both the safety tolerance and pharmacokinetic profile (blood levels) of recombinant CD4 immunoglobulin G (rCD4-IgG) by intravenous bolus administration (given through the vein) in women with HIV infection who are in their third trimester (last three months of pregnancy). To determine the safety of maternal/fetal transfer of rCD4-IgG in infants born to mothers entered into the study. To obtain a preliminary indication of the antiviral and immunologic effects of rCD4-IgG in HIV seropositive pregnant women and their newborns. AMENDED: Part 2: To determine the safety profile of rCD4-IgG in HIV-1-infected women at the onset of labor and in their newborns. To determine the extent of placental transfer of rCD4-IgG when administered to the mother at onset of labor. To determine the pharmacokinetics of rCD4-IgG in newborns. To obtain preliminary evidence of the ability of rCD4-IgG to prevent intrapartum transmission of HIV-1 from mother to fetus. An agent that can prevent HIV infection is desirable for those at risk of infection as well as in the pregnant female and newborn populations. Such an agent may help prevent the progression of the disease in infants and children in early stages of infections. In theory rCD4-IgG has antiviral effects.    ,NCT00000642
HIV,A Phase I Dose Escalation Study of Synthetic Hypericin in HIV-Infected Patients With Less Than 300 CD4 Lymphocytes, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hypericin to define the types of toxicities that may be observed and to determine what doses of the drug are associated with improvements in virological and immunological surrogate markers of HIV infection. To determine the bioavailability of synthetic hypericin given in 2 percent benzyl alcohol solution. Hypericin is unlike other drugs presently being used to treat AIDS patients. Hypericin shows anti-HIV activity in test tube experiments.    ,NCT00000645
HIV,Pentoxifylline (Trental) as a Modulator of Tumor Necrosis Factor and of HIV Replication in Patients With AIDS, To determine whether pentoxifylline lowers tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels in AIDS patients. Pentoxifylline decreases tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and therefore should decrease such TNF-intensified events as cachexia enhanced HIV expression and inhibition of zidovudine (AZT) activity.    ,NCT00000646
HIV,An Open Trial Combining Zidovudine Interferon-alfa and Recombinant CD4-IgG With Transplantation of Syngeneic Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes From Healthy gp160-Immunized Donors in the Treatment of Patients With HIV Infection, To restore immunologic function and virus-free state in HIV-infected patients. Based on previous studies showing temporary improvement in immune function in HIV-infected patients using peripheral lymphocyte transfers and bone marrow transplantation and based on studies documenting the antiretroviral effects of zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alfa (IFN-A) as well as the preliminary test tube and patient studies suggesting anti-HIV effects of recombinant CD4-IgG we propose to treat HIV-infected patients using combination antiretroviral therapy with transplantation of bone marrow and peripheral lymphocytes from previously immunized donors in an attempt to restore immunologic function and a virus-free state.    ,NCT00000647
HIV,A Pilot Study Evaluating Penicillin G and Ceftriaxone as Therapies for Presumed Neurosyphilis in HIV Seropositive Individuals, To provide information on the response of HIV infected neurosyphilis patients to the currently recommended treatment for neurosyphilis; to determine whether possible co-infection with both HIV and syphilis makes more difficult the diagnosis of syphilis; to explore the usefulness of an alternative treatment which if effective would permit outpatient treatment for neurosyphilis that until now required prolonged hospitalization. Studies suggest that syphilis treatment failures may be more common in HIV infected patients than in patients without HIV infection and that treatment failures occur due to and/or are displayed as central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Very little is known about the best treatment course for neurosyphilis in patients who are also infected with HIV.    ,NCT00000648
HIV,An Open-Label Staggered Rising Dose Cohort Study Assessing the Pharmacokinetics Safety and Tolerance of BI-RG-587 in Combination With Zidovudine in Patients With HIV Infection (CD4+ Cell Count < 400/mm3), To assess the safety and tolerance of multiple oral doses of nevirapine in combination with zidovudine (AZT); to get information on the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and dose proportionality of nevirapine/AZT with multiple dosing; to characterize the pattern of virological activity in vivo (in humans) of nevirapine in combination with AZT; to determine whether development of resistance to either drug is slowed by the use of the combination. Drugs now used in treatment for patients with AIDS show some toxicity which limits their usefulness. In addition with long-term treatment with AZT there is evidence of virus resistance to the drug. Compounds that are more effective and less toxic than those in present use would be beneficial especially if they are active against AZT-resistant viruses. Nevirapine has shown in vitro (test tube studies) activity in inhibiting HIV replication (reproduction). In vitro studies have shown that nevirapine and AZT work together to inhibit HIV replication.    ,NCT00000649
HIV,An Assessment of the In Vivo Biological Effects of Diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) in HIV-Infected Patients, To determine in HIV-infected patients the magnitude and duration of the biological effects of ditiocarb sodium (sodium diethyldithiocarbamate; DTC) that may be relevant to treatment of HIV infection. DTC has been studied in previous clinical trials in HIV-infected patients with the suggestion of delay in disease progression to AIDS and improvement in CD4 counts while on the drug.    ,NCT00000650
HIV,A Randomized Double Blind Comparative Study of Dideoxycytidine (ddC) Alone or ddC/AZT Combination Versus Zidovudine (ZDV) Alone in Patients With HIV Infection Who Have Received Prior ZDV Therapy, To evaluate the safety of zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) alone and in combination with zidovudine (AZT) versus AZT alone when administered to asymptomatic patients with a CD4 count = or < 200 cells/mm3 and symptomatic patients with a CD4 count = or < 300 cells/mm3. To compare the effectiveness of ddC alone and in combination with AZT versus AZT alone. ddC has been shown to demonstrate an antiviral effect. AZT has been shown to significantly decrease mortality and reduce the frequency of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS or advanced ARC. After 1 year of AZT therapy the effectiveness tends to diminish and patients progress with more opportunistic infections and higher mortality rates. Because of the demonstrated antiviral activity absence of hematologic toxicity and lack of cross tolerance in laboratory studies of ddC a study to investigate the long-term effectiveness of ddC in patients with HIV infection who have received AZT therapy is warranted.    ,NCT00000651
HIV,A Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety and Toxicity of the Combination of Zidovudine and 2'3'-Dideoxyinosine (Didanosine) in Children With HIV Infection, To assess the safety and tolerance of the combination of zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI) in children with HIV infection. New approaches to using available agents may provide increased or improved treatment options for AIDS. Combination therapy is expected to play a major role in improving survival and quality of life for HIV-infected individuals. AZT and ddI are two agents that have been most extensively evaluated and for which the evidence for antiretroviral effectiveness is strongest.    ,NCT00000652
HIV,A Trial of Two Doses of 2'3'-Dideoxycytidine (ddC) in the Treatment of Children With Symptomatic HIV Infection Who Are Intolerant of AZT and/or Who Show Progressive Disease While on AZT, To evaluate and compare the long-term (48-177 weeks) safety tolerance and efficacy of two doses of zalcitabine ( dideoxycytidine; ddC ) taken orally every 8 hours in children with symptomatic HIV infection who have one of the following: intolerance to zidovudine ( AZT ) (development of toxicity during prolonged AZT therapy) demonstrated disease progression after 6 months of AZT therapy OR both AZT intolerance and disease progression after 6 months of AZT therapy. As useful as AZT appears to be in the treatment of patients infected with HIV it is associated with significant toxicity in some patients and it does not prevent ultimate progression to AIDS and eventual mortality. Thus there is a clear need for new antiretroviral drugs and ddC is one such promising agent.    ,NCT00000653
HIV,A Phase I/II Open Label Study to Evaluate the Antiviral Potential of Combination Zidovudine and 2' 3'-Dideoxyinosine (Didanosine) in Patients With Asymptomatic HIV Disease, To assess the safety and to evaluate the anti-HIV effect of low- moderate- and high-dose schedules of zidovudine (AZT) plus didanosine (ddI) versus ddI alone in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients. Because of the failure with long-term (more than 1 year) use of frequency of toxicity from and drug resistance to AZT drug combinations need to be developed to enable lower less toxic doses of AZT to be used and to slow or prevent the development of resistance while providing at least the same effectiveness.    ,NCT00000656
HIV,A Phase II Trial of rsCD4 and AZT in Patients With AIDS or Advanced AIDS Related Complex (ARC), Part 1A: To find the dose of zidovudine (AZT) that causes less than a 50 percent drop in HIV-1 p24 antigen levels in patients with AIDS and advanced AIDS related complex (ARC); to determine the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of rsCD4 administered in combination with AZT. Parts 1B and 2: To test for additive or synergistic activity between rsCD4 and AZT as judged by falls in HIV-1 p24 antigen levels; and to evaluate the safety of rsCD4 and AZT in patients with AIDS and advanced ARC. AZT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of AIDS and advanced ARC but not without toxicity. The most clinically significant toxicity is dose related inhibition of bone marrow function. Furthermore HIV-1 isolates from patients treated for more than 6 months with AZT have now been found which appear to have reduced sensitivity to AZT. The incidence of toxicity and occurrence of virus with reduced sensitivity to AZT may result in the inability to administer AZT long-term to patients with AIDS and advanced ARC. Recombinant soluble CD4 (rCD4) has shown antiretroviral effects and has been shown to be safe when given to AIDS and ARC patients either as a single agent or in combination with AZT.    ,NCT00000659
HIV,The Pharmacokinetics of Zidovudine and Oxazepam Alone and in Combination in the HIV-Infected Patient, To determine if a pharmacokinetic (blood level) interaction exists between zidovudine (AZT) and oxazepam in the HIV-infected patient. Benzodiazepines (such as oxazepam) are among the most frequently prescribed class of drugs and are commonly used therapeutically for patients with chronic disease. This study is important because of the potential for toxicity resulting from a reaction between AZT and benzodiazepines and the likelihood of frequent use of the combination of these drugs in patients with HIV infection.    ,NCT00000661
HIV,A Treatment IND for Retrovir Brand Zidovudine (AZT) Therapy of Pediatric Patients With HIV Disease, To facilitate the use of zidovudine (AZT) in children who are 3 months to 12 years of age who are HIV-infected and either symptomatic or have a CD4 cell count < 400 cells/mm3 and to monitor adverse effects of AZT. Previous studies with pediatric patients have shown improvements in clinical immunologic and virologic parameters with administration of AZT.    ,NCT00000662
HIV,A Phase I Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Recombinant CD4 Immunoglobulin G (rCD4-IgG) in Infants and Children With Documented HIV-1 Infection, To determine the safety profile assess pharmacokinetic properties (blood levels) and obtain preliminary indication of the antiviral and immunologic effects of recombinant CD4 immunoglobulin G (CD4-IgG). CD4-IgG may be effective in blocking HIV transmission and spread that is CD4-IgG has antiviral effects. Studies done in adult patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC) have shown that rCD4 can be safely administered by intravenous bolus intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. No serious or dose-limiting drug-related toxicities have been observed to date.    ,NCT00000663
HIV,Safety and Efficacy of Polyethylene Glycolated IL-2 (PEG IL-2) Plus Zidovudine in HIV Positive Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Individuals, To determine the safety of polyethylene glycolated IL-2 (PEG IL2) administered weekly or biweekly (per amendment) in a setting of oral zidovudine (AZT). To determine the effect of PEG IL2 in combination with AZT on parameters assessing the immune system as well as HIV virus and antibody titers. To evaluate a chronic dosing study phase offered to patients who complete the initial 25-week regimen. Recent research has focused on enhancing cell-mediated immunity and reducing or eliminating viral replication (reproduction and growth). A main thrust of current treatment is the combination of antiviral drugs that may be more effective when combined than when each is used alone.    ,NCT00000664
HIV,A Phase I/II Dose Escalation Study of Intradermal gp160 to Evaluate Safety Delayed Type Hypersensitivity (Skin Test) Responses and Immunogenicity in Asymptomatic HIV Seropositive Patients With More Than 400 CD4+ Cells," To determine the safety of intradermal gp160 in HIV seropositive individuals who are asymptomatic and have a relatively intact immune system. To determine whether there is evidence of a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response (a ""positive"" skin test) in these patients and also the dose of gp160 that elicits a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response. Early immunity to HIV may play an important role in the long interval between virus infection and the onset of clinical disease. Immune responses have been demonstrated in HIV-infected individuals within weeks to months of infection. Although none of these responses has been shown to be protective it is possible that boosting anti-HIV immune responses through immunization may slow the progression of HIV infection. DTH responses to HIV-derived recombinant envelope glycoprotein could provide a means of measuring an important immune function in infected patients and serve as an easily measured surrogate marker of cellular immunity. In addition to eliciting local cutaneous DTH responses intradermal inoculation of skin test antigens may be immunogenic resulting in new antibody production and cellular immune responses. This study allows direct comparison of gp160 administered intradermally with alum-adjuvanted intramuscular preparation with respect to immunogenicity in HIV seropositive patients.    ",NCT00000667
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study of 2'3'-Dideoxyinosine (ddI) Administered Twice Daily to Infants and Children With AIDS or Symptomatic HIV Infection, To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 2'3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) given orally and intravenously in infants and children with AIDS. The study also measures bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the administered drug and provides a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of ddI on HIV replication. AMENDED: Based on safety established in the first dosing phase of 52 weeks and long term dosing data in adults the dosing period will be extended to 104 weeks. Original design: Information presently available indicates that ddI has high antiviral activity with less apparent toxicity than zidovudine (AZT) (the drug presently used to treat AIDS).    ,NCT00000669
HIV,Safety and Tolerance of Zidovudine With Probenecid and the Effect of Probenecid on Zidovudine Pharmacokinetics Over Four Weeks, To evaluate the interaction of probenecid with zidovudine (AZT). Because AZT is eliminated quickly from the body it must be taken frequently. A previous study showed that probenecid slowed the elimination of AZT without side effects but that study lasted only 5 days. This study is to see whether this effect continues for 1 month and whether the continuation of probenecid and AZT is free of side effects over 1 month.    ,NCT00000670
HIV,A Phase II Efficacy Study Comparing 2'3'-Dideoxyinosine (ddI) (BMY-40900) and Zidovudine Therapy of Patients With HIV Infection Who Have Been on Long Term Zidovudine Treatment, To compare the effectiveness and toxicity of didanosine (ddI) and zidovudine (AZT) in patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex (ARC) who have tolerated AZT therapy for 12 months or longer. Per amendment asymptomatic patients with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3 are eligible. AZT is effective in reducing mortality in patients with AIDS who receive the drug after the first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and in patients with advanced ARC. However AZT therapy has been associated with significant toxicities. In addition the effectiveness of AZT appears to decrease during the second and third years of therapy. For these reasons the development of alternative therapy that would be at least as effective but less toxic is of great importance. The drug ddI is an antiviral agent that inhibits replication of HIV with less apparent toxicity than AZT. Studies indicate that ddI remains active in the body for at least 12 hours; thus benefits of ddI might be achieved with a low frequency of drug administration.    ,NCT00000671
HIV,An Efficacy Study of 2'3'-Dideoxyinosine (ddI) (BMY-40900) Administered Orally Twice Daily to Zidovudine Intolerant Patients With AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex, AMENDED: 8/29/90 Inclusion of asymptomatic patients with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3. Standardization of baseline evaluation schedule to allow 14 days prior to study dosing. Reduction in frequency and intensity of follow-up evaluations. Standardization of study endpoints. Inclusion of toxicity scoring and management for amylase and triglyceride elevations. Clarification of concomitant medication use. Original design: To determine the effectiveness of didanosine (ddI) in patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex (ARC) who have documented hematologic intolerance to zidovudine (AZT) therapy. To determine if the efficacy of ddI increases with increasing doses. AZT is effective in reducing mortality in patients with AIDS who receive the drug after the first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and in patients with advanced ARC. However AZT therapy has been associated with significant toxicities. In addition the effectiveness of AZT appears to decrease during the second and third years of therapy. For these reasons the development of alternative therapy that would be at least as effective but less toxic is of great importance. The drug ddI is an antiviral agent that inhibits replication (reproduction) of HIV with less apparent toxicity than AZT. The major dose-limiting toxicities found in the Phase I studies have been pains in the feet and legs of 2 patients initially receiving 12 mg/kg/day and 12 patients receiving daily doses of 25.8 to 51.2 mg/kg; symptoms began 8 to 27 weeks after initiating ddI treatment. These neuropathy-like symptoms have generally not been associated with significant abnormalities in nerve conduction studies and patients have reported marked improvement in symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks of discontinuing ddI. Some patients have resumed ddI treatment at a reduced dose after resolution of their symptoms. Studies indicate that ddI remains active in the body for at least 12 hours. This indicates that benefits of ddI might be achieved with a low frequency of drug administration.    ,NCT00000672
HIV,A Phase I Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Recombinant Human CD4 Immunoglobulin (rCd4-IgG) Administered by Intravenous Bolus in Patients With AIDS and AIDS Related Complex, To study the safety and pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of recombinant human CD4 immunoglobulin (rCd4-IgG) in patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) who have failed or declined therapy with zidovudine (AZT). An additional goal of the study is to obtain a preliminary indication of the antiviral effects of Cd4-IgG in patients with AIDS or ARC. Other approaches in addition to existing treatment of HIV infection need to be evaluated. One approach may be to block HIV infection by interrupting the assembly of the virus within the cell or the budding of virus from the membrane of the infected cell. In addition blocking the attachment of HIV to its cellular receptor may offer another point of attack. HIV binds to the CD4 receptor on the target T4 lymphocyte and the envelope glycoprotein of the virus (gp120) is capable of high affinity binding to CD4. Any agent that prevents the attachment of gp120 to the CD4 receptor should be able to block virus transmission and spread. Recently scientists have succeeded in producing highly purified recombinant soluble human CD4. Recombinant CD4 is capable of binding to HIV envelope protein (gp120) and inhibiting HIV infectivity in test tube studies. Potential therapeutic benefit in patients with HIV infection could be derived from either or both of these biologic effects. In order to extend the length of time that rCD4 stays in the body the compound has been modified by combining it with a human immunoglobulin of the IgG1 class (IgG).    ,NCT00000675
HIV,Dideoxycytidine ( Ro 24-2027 ) A Randomized Open-Label Comparative Study of Dideoxycytidine ( ddC ) Versus Zidovudine ( AZT ) in Patients With AIDS or Advanced ARC Who Have Received Long-Term AZT Therapy., To compare the effectiveness of zalcitabine ( dideoxycytidine; ddC ) therapy to zidovudine ( AZT ) in the treatment of AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex ( ARC ) in patients who have already received at least 1 year of AZT therapy and to define the safety profile. ddC has been shown to have an antiviral effect and AZT is known to significantly decrease mortality and to reduce the frequency of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS or advanced ARC. After 1 year of AZT therapy the effectiveness tends to diminish and patients progress with more opportunistic infections and higher mortality rates. This may be due to the emergence of AZT resistant virus isolated from some patients who have been on long-term AZT therapy. These isolates were still sensitive to ddC. A study of long-term effectiveness of ddC in patients with AIDS or advanced ARC who have been on long-term AZT therapy is warranted because (1) ddC has antiviral activity (2) there is no blood toxicity associated with taking ddC and (3) the effectiveness of ddC in test tube studies does not seem to be diminished by decreased effectiveness of AZT.    ,NCT00000678
HIV,(Ro 24-2027) A Randomized Double-Blind Comparative Study of Dideoxycytidine (ddC) Versus Zidovudine (AZT) in Patients With AIDS or Advanced ARC, To show that zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) is at least as effective as zidovudine (AZT) in the treatment of AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex (ARC) and also that ddC shows a different safety profile than AZT. In clinical studies ddC shows antiviral activity. Because of the antiviral activity and because of the low incidence of mild reversible neurotoxicity and absence of blood-related toxicity with low dose ddC therapy a long-term Phase II/III study comparing ddC to AZT in patients with AIDS or advanced ARC is now warranted.    ,NCT00000679
HIV,A Phase I Study of Autologous Activated CD8(+) Lymphocytes Expanded In Vitro and Infused With or Without Recombinant Interleukin-2 to Patients With AIDS or Severe ARC, 1) To determine whether it is possible to remove and culture (increase in number and activate) in the laboratory CD8(+) lymphocytes (white blood cells) from HIV-infected patients receiving zidovudine (AZT); 2) To determine the toxicity of returning to the patients intravenously the expanded and activated autologous cells (given to the patient from whom they were taken) with and without giving the patients recombinant interleukin-2 ( aldesleukin; IL-2 ) at the same time; 3) To radiolabel (mark) the CD8(+) lymphocytes with Indium 111 and then scan the patients to determine the distribution of the CD8(+) lymphocytes in those who are and are not given IL-2 infusions; 4) To determine the toxicity of IL-2 given at the same time with autologous CD8(+) lymphocytes; 5) To measure changes in the immunology of the subjects following these treatments. CD8(+) cells are suppressor/killer lymphocyte cells that act to limit replication of viruses. It is hoped that the reinfusion of activated autologous CD8(+) cells into patients with AIDS will help to control opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis (two of the leading causes of sickness and death in AIDS patients). This treatment may also stop the HIV virus from replicating (reproducing itself) in the AIDS patient. Further activation of these cells once infused may be necessary. It is hoped that IL-2 will stimulate the patient's immune system against the AIDS virus along with the activated CD8(+) cells. Thus IL-2 will be given and its effects studied.    ,NCT00000680
HIV,A Randomized Unblinded Trial of Zidovudine Versus ddC in the Treatment of Patients Status Post PCP Who Received Long-Term Zidovudine Therapy in Protocol ACTG 002, To evaluate the efficacy of AZT versus ddC in terms of survival antiviral effects neurological status and health status in patients post Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) who received long-term AZT therapy in ACTG protocol 002 While treatment with AZT has been found to be effective in prolonging survival and reducing the numbers of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS during the second year of administration of AZT an acceleration in mortality has been observed. The reasons for this are not known at this time. The study of what may be an AZT-resistant strain of HIV may benefit patients who have been and are still receiving AZT or another drug used in treating HIV ddC. It is hoped that the comparison of the effectiveness of AZT and ddC will benefit in the treatment of these patients.    ,NCT00000682
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Randomized Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Recombinant Vaccinia Virus Expressing the Envelope Glycoproteins of Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity (immunological reactivity) of HIVAC-1e vaccine. An additional goal is to determine which dose level of vaccine might be most effective. Specific questions to be addressed in this part of the study include: Are there adverse reactions to gp160 vaccine when given to vaccinees previously immunized with a vaccinia-recombinant? Does gp160 vaccination of prior HIVAC-1e vaccine result in stimulation of neutralizing antibody and other humoral immune responses? Does vaccination with gp160 enhance the development of cell-mediated immune responses in HIVAC-1e vaccinees? Is the magnitude of immune response to gp160 booster immunization greater following priming with GP160 recombinant vaccinia (HIVAC-1e) vaccination than priming with three doses of purified recombinant gp160? AMENDED: An 80 mcg dose of gp160 has been chosen for the booster because this dose has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in previous trials and allows comparison of the late boost in this protocol with the late boost in the protocol in which patients were primed with three doses of gp160. Original design: HIVAC-1e vaccine is a preparation of the envelope protein of HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). The protein is produced by genetic modification in vaccinia virus. The purpose of a vaccine is to produce an artificially increased immunity to a particular disease in this case AIDS. Since there is no known cure for AIDS the control of this disease necessitates the development of effective prevention such as vaccines.    ,NCT00000683
HIV,Continuous High-Dose Intravenous Dextran Sulfate in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Individuals, To determine the safety and effectiveness of dextran sulfate when it is administered intravenously at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as a treatment for HIV infection in AIDS patients. The effect of dextran sulfate on platelet survival will also be assessed in 3 patients to help determine the mechanism of thrombocytopenia (low platelets) noted in all patients receiving intravenous dextran sulfate in this study. Dextran sulfate appears to inhibit HIV in experiments in the test tube but studies conducted in humans to determine its effect on HIV when dextran sulfate is given orally have not been conclusive. It is hoped that this study will show that dextran sulfate administered intravenously    ,NCT00000684
HIV,A Study of Zidovudine in HIV-Infected Patients With Kidney Problems, To determine how zidovudine (AZT) for the treatment of HIV infection is metabolized and excreted or eliminated in patients with infected or diseased kidneys. To determine the influence of hemodialysis and establish dose guidelines. AZT is the only antiviral agent with demonstrated effectiveness in patients with severe HIV infection. Persons with HIV infection may have additional health problems one of which is a diseased kidney due to infection of the kidney or side effects of therapy. The benefits and risks of AZT in patients with diseased kidneys are unknown. It is hoped that this study will allow further understanding of the metabolism and excretion of AZT in patients with kidney disease. AZT pharmacokinetics will be studied in patients with mild moderate and severe renal disorders    ,NCT00000685
HIV,A Study of d4T in Patients With AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex Who Cannot Take AZT, To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 2'3'-dideoxy-2'3'-didehydrothymidine (d4T) administered to patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) who are intolerant of zidovudine (AZT). The study also begins an assessment of the effectiveness of d4T therapy on HIV replication on plasma levels of p24 antigen and clinical or immunologic parameters associated with AIDS. Of the methods that are being evaluated to treat HIV-infected individuals AZT has produced the best results to date. Toxic effects in approximately 50 percent of patients receiving AZT may limit its usefulness for prolonged treatment. Long-term treatment may be necessary to prevent progression of early stage HIV infection to AIDS and to prevent secondary transmission. Other drugs that may be equally or more effective than AZT and useful in the long- term treatment of HIV infection must be developed and evaluated. Test-tube and animal studies of d4T show that the drug can inhibit replication (reproduction) of HIV at concentrations similar to concentrations of AZT that have anti-HIV activity. These studies also indicate that the drug may stay in the bloodstream longer than AZT. Thus it may be possible for the drug to be as effective as AZT when taken less frequently than AZT. It also may have a less disturbing effect on other body functions (such as thymidine metabolism).    ,NCT00000686
HIV,Single Dose Pharmacokinetics of Oral Dextran Sulfate (UA001) and Intravenous Dextran Sulfate in Healthy Volunteers, To evaluate how the drug dextran sulfate (DS) is absorbed by the stomach and intestines when taken by mouth. To evaluate its effect on blood coagulation. DS has been reported to have anti-HIV activity. However it is not known how much of the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream and can be used by the body when DS is taken by mouth.    ,NCT00000690
HIV,Phase I Rising Dose Tolerability Study of SC-48334 in Patients With Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and Advanced AIDS Related Complex, To determine the following about the use of SC-48334 in patients with AIDS and advanced AIDS related complex (ARC): 1. The largest maximum tolerated dose (MTD); 2. Effectiveness against HIV; 3. Pharmacokinetics - how fast SC-48334 reaches the bloodstream what concentration is reached and how long it remains in the patient's blood. SC-48334 is a chemical that prevents the biochemical actions of certain enzymes in the body and recent studies have shown that it may also prevent the activity of HIV. The study will attempt to show whether SC-48334 can safely and effectively break the cycle of HIV infection in AIDS and advanced ARC by progressively eliminating HIV.    ,NCT00000692
HIV,A Phase I/II Open Label Study To Evaluate the Antiviral Potential of Combination Low-Dose Therapy With Zidovudine and Interferon-Alpha 2A in Patients With Symptomatic HIV Disease, To evaluate the anti-HIV effect of single agent versus combination therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and interferon alfa-2a (IFN-A2a) as measured by p24 protein expression viral growth and infectivity in patients with symptomatic HIV disease. To assess the safety of low dose schedules of AZT and IFN-A2a alone and in combination as measured by neutrophil counts and hepatic transaminase levels. To evaluate the comparative effects of single agent versus combination therapy with AZT and IFN-A2a on CD4 cell counts and skin test reactivity. AZT is known to be an effective treatment for HIV infection. However patients may develop reactions to AZT when it is administered for long periods of time. Combining AZT with another drug at lower doses might reduce toxicity in patients and prevent the development of drug resistant strains. IFN-A2a can reduce the growth of HIV in test tube experiments and recent studies have shown that when AZT and IFN-A2a are used together they reduce the growth of HIV more effectively than when either drug is used alone. This study will examine the effectiveness and safety of these drugs when they are given together and compare these results with the effectiveness and safety of the drugs when they are used alone.    ,NCT00000696
HIV,A Phase I/II Trial of Ribavirin (With Escalation) + Isoprinosine in Asymptomatic HIV-Viremic Patients, To determine the safety and effectiveness of treatment with ribavirin (RBV) plus isoprinosine (INPX) in preventing the development of AIDS in patients infected with the AIDS virus (HIV). Also to determine the maximal dose of RBV that can be tolerated by HIV-infected patients when RBV is given with INPX. The patients may or may not have generalized lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS). RBV has prevented the development of AIDS in some HIV-infected patients with LAS and INPX has stimulated the immune system of patients infected with HIV. The immune system fights infections in the human body and the HIV attacks T cells that are an important part of the immune system. Reports from individual cases treated with both RBV and INPX suggest that clinical improvements occurred in HIV-infected patients but there is no reliable information on the safety and effectiveness of this drug combination in such patients.    ,NCT00000699
HIV,A Multi-Center Clinical Trial To Evaluate Azidothymidine (AZT) in the Treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection in Patients With AIDS Post First Episode PCP, To examine the dose of zidovudine (AZT) that was used in the first placebo-controlled study of AZT in AIDS patients as well as a lower dose of AZT in order to determine if the lower dose results in less harmful side effects while still being effective. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of AZT in AIDS therapy. AZT has been effective in test tube studies at varying doses. There is a need to see if lower doses result in effective therapy with less harmful side effects.    ,NCT00000700
HIV,A Phase I Evaluation of Azidothymidine (AZT) in Children With Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS Related Complex (ARC), The study is designed to test the drug zidovudine (AZT) in children including study of drug levels in various parts of the body fluids safety of the drug and its effect on different parts of the body. The effects of any drug the way a drug enters the bloodstream the way it is used by the body and the way the body eliminates the drug may be very different in children compared with adults. The largest group of children who have AIDS are those who are less than 2 years of age. AIDS is often first identified in infants who are about 6 months old. Studies of AZT show that it might be useful in the treatment of AIDS. Thus it is important to study the effects of the drug in children.    ,NCT00000701
HIV,A Multicenter Dose Ranging Clinical Trial of 2'3'-Dideoxycytidine in the Treatment of Patients With AIDS and Advanced ARC., To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of the drug 2'3'-dideoxycytidine ( zalcitabine; ddC ) in treating patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex ( ARC ). Recent studies show that a certain group of drugs (dideoxynucleosides) are effective in treating patients with HIV infection. ddC is a dideoxynucleoside and test tube studies show that it may be valuable in treating AIDS patients. ddC has been shown to be well tolerated in certain patients with AIDS.    ,NCT00000704
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Azidothymidine (AZT) in HIV-Positive Patients With Hemophilia, The purpose of this study is to see if giving azidothymidine (AZT) to HIV-positive patients with hemophilia is safe and if it is effective in lowering HIV levels and boosting the immune system. HIV infects and inactivates certain blood cells that are part of the body's immune system. The damage to the body's immune system can result in unusual infections and/or unusual forms of cancer. A large percentage of hemophiliacs are HIV-positive and there is a clear risk for the development of AIDS in these patients. AZT may be effective in lowering HIV levels and boosting the immune system but its side effects are not understood in these patients.    ,NCT00000705
HIV,Influence of Probenecid and Quinine on the Pharmacokinetics of Azidothymidine, Part I studies the effect of quinine on how zidovudine (AZT) is used by the body and eliminated through the kidneys in HIV infected patients. Part II studies the effect of probenecid and quinine on the same aspects. Because AZT leaves the bloodstream quickly patients must take the drug frequently to keep adequate amounts in their bodies. Probenecid and quinine may slow down the rate at which AZT leaves the body. Therefore taking these drugs along with AZT may reduce the amount of AZT needed for treatment.    ,NCT00000706
HIV,A Phase I Safety Efficacy and Pharmacokinetic Study of 2'3'-Dideoxyinosine (ddI) Administered Twice Daily to Patients With AIDS or AIDS Related Complex, To determine the safety pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and effectiveness of didanosine (ddI) when administered both intravenously and orally. After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined an appropriate dosage regimen will then be established for Phase II and Phase III trials. Zidovudine (AZT) has produced the best clinical results in the drug therapy of AIDS to date but it produces toxicity in approximately 50 percent of patients. Early data show that ddI possesses high antiviral activity and less toxicity than AZT. The most effective route and dose of ddI has yet to be determined.    ,NCT00000710
HIV,Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor and Zidovudine: A Phase I Study of Concurrent Administration in Patients With AIDS and Severe ARC, To administer colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for 4 weeks to AIDS and advanced AIDS related complex (ARC) patients who have been receiving zidovudine (AZT) therapy in order to obtain data on short-term effectiveness safety toxicity pharmacokinetics and tolerance of combined treatment with the two drugs. Persons infected with HIV virus may undergo a long latency or persistent virus blood levels which may be present before any symptomatic illness. These individuals could therefore benefit from therapy with an effective antiretroviral agent. AZT which is a powerful inhibitor of human retrovirus has been approved for management of patients with symptomatic HIV infection. GM-CSF not only stimulates the bone marrow it enhances the function of mature blood cells and has been found to enhance the ability of AZT to suppress HIV replication in vitro (test tube). Combination therapy with GM-CSF and AZT may lower complications as well as the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection.    ,NCT00000711
HIV,A Multicenter Double Blind Comparative Study of Zidovudine Alone Versus Zidovudine and Acyclovir as Treatment for HIV-Infected Patients With CD4+ Counts Less Than 200 Cells/mm3, Original design: The study's purpose is to compare the effects of zidovudine (AZT) alone to the combination of AZT and acyclovir (ACV) to determine if AZT/ACV is associated with a lower death rate and fewer AIDS related opportunistic infections compared to AZT alone and to investigate the effect of these treatment plans on cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections. The study evaluates two doses of AZT used alone versus two doses of AZT combined with ACV. Per 12/11/92 amendment: Another antiretroviral agent may be substituted for AZT. AZT has been shown to increase the life span of patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex and patients being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Drugs that increase the effectiveness of AZT against HIV may also decrease the need for high doses of AZT. This might reduce some of the negative effects of AZT while not reducing the positive effects.    ,NCT00000712
HIV,A Phase I Clinical Trial To Evaluate the Toxicity Antiviral and Immunomodulatory Effects of a Range of Doses of Ampligen in HIV-Infected Subjects, To determine the safety of ampligen at several doses in HIV-infected patients who have not yet developed AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex (ARC). Biologic antiviral and immunologic effects will be studied. Evidence indicates that a long period with no symptoms follows infection with HIV. Individuals who are infected with the virus could benefit from therapy with a drug that acts to kill the virus or to stimulate the immune system of the individual or both. The immune system is the means the human body has for fighting infections. Ampligen is a suitable drug for clinical trials against HIV because it has been shown to stimulate the immune system and to inhibit HIV in vitro (test tube) at drug levels that can be achieved without noticeable clinical side effects.    ,NCT00000713
HIV,A Multicenter Trial To Evaluate Oral Retrovir in the Treatment of Children With Symptomatic HIV Infection, To evaluate the safety and tolerance of oral zidovudine (AZT) when given over a period of 24 weeks to children between 3 months and 12 years of age. The effectiveness of AZT in treating HIV infection in infants and children will also be evaluated. HIV infection in children is most often associated with symptomatic disease and poor prognosis. Treatment with antiviral therapy may be effective in altering the course of the disease and decreasing mortality in these children. AZT has been shown to be effective in certain adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection. It is therefore likely that infected children may also benefit from this treatment.    ,NCT00000716
HIV,A Clinical Trial of Alternating and Intermittent Regimens of 2'3'-Dideoxycytidine and 3'-Azido-3'-Deoxythymidine in the Treatment of Patients With AIDS and Advanced ARC, To determine if alternating zidovudine (AZT) and zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) (first one and then the other) or intermittent therapy (1 week of drug then 1 week off) will lessen the toxic effects of either drug alone while still inhibiting HIV (the AIDS virus) in patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex. AZT extends the survival of some patients with AIDS and both AZT and ddC are known to inhibit the growth of HIV. When AZT or ddC is given continuously over a prolonged period of time toxic effects occur that are not found when the drugs are given for 4 - 6 weeks. It is hoped that by alternating the drugs or by giving one drug intermittently the toxic effects can be decreased without lowering the therapeutic effectiveness of the drugs.    ,NCT00000718
HIV,A Trial of Alternating 2'3'-Dideoxycytidine and Zidovudine in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced HIV Disease, To determine the long-term safety and tolerance of four alternating and two intermittent regimens of zidovudine ( AZT ) and 2'3'-dideoxycytidine ( zalcitabine; ddC ) in the treatment of patients with advanced HIV disease who have had to discontinue AZT because of true hematologic intolerance to standard reduced doses of AZT. AIDS is a serious infectious disease caused by a new family of retrovirus which is spread primarily through sexual contact and administration of blood or blood products. Individuals who are infected with HIV could therefore benefit from therapy with an effective anti-AIDS virus agent. AZT and ddC have both been tested as antiviral agents and their potentially beneficial effects may be limited by time- and dose-dependent toxicity. A combination regimen using shorter courses of AZT and ddC might therefore be able to sustain treatment without producing toxicity. In addition since the two drugs exhibit their major toxicity on different organ systems cumulative or additive toxicity would not be expected.    ,NCT00000719
HIV,A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial To Evaluate Intravenous Gamma Globulin in Children With Symptomatic HIV Infection Receiving Zidovudine, To evaluate the clinical immunologic and virologic effects of oral zidovudine (AZT) plus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) versus AZT plus placebo (albumin). It is estimated that by 1991 there may be 10000 to 20000 HIV-infected children in the United States. HIV infection in children is most often associated with symptomatic disease and poor prognosis. Treatment with antiviral therapy may be effective in changing the course of disease and decreasing mortality in this vulnerable population. AZT treatment has been shown to decrease mortality and the frequency of opportunistic infections in certain adult AIDS patients; therefore it is likely that children may also benefit from this antiviral therapy. In addition bacterial infections are frequently found in HIV-infected children. Because pooled human serum immunoglobulin another name for antibodies is effective in reducing bacterial infection in patients with defects of immunity it may reduce the rate of bacterial infection in HIV-infected children as well. In this study AZT will be administered together with IVIG to determine safety tolerance and efficacy of the combined treatment.    ,NCT00000720
HIV,An Escalating Dose Tolerance Trial of BG8962 (rCD4) in Patients Who Are HIV Antibody Positive, To determine the maximal safe daily dose of BG8962 (rCD4) which can be administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) over 24 hours; to determine the pharmacokinetics of BG8962 when it is administered by intramuscular and subcutaneous routes; and to look for dose related antiviral activity determined by quantitation of infectious HIV peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and plasma and by monitoring the blood levels of viral p24 antigen (when present) CD4+ T-cells and Beta-2- microglobulin. Recombinant soluble CD4 protein (rCD4) is a drug that has been produced by genetic engineering techniques. In laboratory studies rCD4 binds to HIV and reduces its ability to enter the cell thus inhibiting its reproduction. Before rCD4 can be tested for therapeutic effectiveness in HIV-infected patients it is necessary to determine the maximum dose that can be tolerated by humans. AMENDED: To date Biogen's original sequence recombinant soluble CD4 and Biogen's natural sequence recombinant soluble CD4 have both been referred to as recombinant soluble CD4 (rsCD4). In order to distinguish between these two products a change in nomenclature has been made. In this protocol whenever the original sequence CD4 molecule is referred to it is called recombinant soluble T4 (rsT4). Whenever the natural sequence molecule (currently under study in this protocol) is referred to it is called BG8962 or rCD4. Whenever the drug is discussed generically it is referred to as rsCD4.    ,NCT00000721
HIV,Phase I Trial of the Combination of Zidovudine and Recombinant Interleukin-2 in Patients With Persistent Generalized Lymphadenopathy, To evaluate the short-term effects of administering zidovudine ( AZT ) at the same time with increasing doses of aldesleukin ( interleukin-2; IL-2 ) in patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy syndrome ( PGL ). The effects to be studied include safety or toxicity how quickly the drugs are used in the body effects on the immune system effects on HIV concentrations in body fluids and how quickly the drugs are cleared by the kidneys. The trial will establish the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) and will be a pilot study to determine the dose that has the greatest effect in the immune system. AZT has been shown to be effective in HIV-related disease. IL-2 has been shown to increase immune responses and correct immune problems caused by HIV in the test tube. IL-2 has also been effective in treating Kaposi's sarcoma in a number of patients. Because of the clinical activities of these two drugs and because their toxicities and mechanisms of action do not overlap it may be beneficial to combine the two drugs with their antiviral and immune stimulatory effects.    ,NCT00000728
HIV,A Multicenter Study To Determine Foscarnet Dose Response in HIV Infected Patients With PGL and/or Constitutional Disease, To determine the toxicity of low dose foscarnet administered for 4 weeks to HIV infected patients who are asymptomatic have AIDS or other HIV associated conditions and a CD4+ lymphocyte count < 500 cells/mm3. To obtain preliminary efficacy data. Although zidovudine (AZT) has been effective in treating some AIDS patients AZT has toxic effects in many patients and other means of treating HIV-infected persons need to be evaluated. In vitro (test tube) studies have shown that the human herpes viruses are inhibited by foscarnet and that a number of retroviruses including HIV are sensitive to it. It is hoped that treatment of HIV-infected individuals with foscarnet during an early phase of HIV infections will reduce the risk of developing AIDS.    ,NCT00000729
HIV,Evaluation of the Interaction Between Acetaminophen and Zidovudine, To determine if zidovudine (AZT) and acetaminophen (APAP) interact when given to the same patient and if so the manner of interaction. Patients with AIDS often require therapy with painkillers for the management of mild pain and discomfort associated with their disease and APAP is often prescribed. AZT is being used to treat AIDS patients. It is important for doctors to understand how AZT and APAP may interact when given to the same patient because other studies have suggested that the dosage of AZT may have to be adjusted when given with APAP in order to avoid or minimize adverse effects.    ,NCT00000731
HIV,Evaluation of the Interaction Between Low Dose Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim and Zidovudine, To determine if the pharmacokinetics of low doses of zidovudine (AZT) (that is how fast AZT reaches the blood what concentration of AZT is attained in the blood and how long AZT remains in the blood) changes from day-to-day in the same patient. Also to determine whether the pharmacokinetics of AZT is changed by sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) given at the same time or whether the pharmacokinetics of SMX/TMP is altered by AZT therapy. AZT has been effective in treating some patients with AIDS and SMX/TMP is an antibiotic combination which is useful in preventing or treating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) which is an important cause of disease and death in patients with AIDS. It is important to know how drugs interact in patients because addition of a second drug may change the speed at which a drug is eliminated from the body and cause increased toxic effects or decreased therapeutic effects.    ,NCT00000732
HIV,Phase I Pharmacokinetic and Tolerance Study of Ribavirin in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) - Infected Patients, To determine how fast ribavirin reaches the bloodstream what concentration of ribavirin is reached in blood and how long it remains in the blood (pharmacokinetics) when given by different routes of administration. To find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ribavirin. The effects of ribavirin on the immune system and on the virus will be measured by T4 cell count and p24 antigen levels. Early studies with ribavirin in patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC) have shown that ribavirin appears to inhibit the spread of the virus. Determination of how much and how often to give the drug will require further knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the drug in patients with AIDS or ARC and in chronic virus carriers who do not have symptoms.    ,NCT00000733
HIV,Evaluation of the Interaction Between High Dose Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim and Zidovudine, To determine if the pharmacokinetics of high doses of zidovudine (AZT) (that is how fast AZT reaches the blood what concentration of AZT is attained in the blood and how long AZT remains in the blood) changes from day to day in the same patient. Also to determine whether the pharmacokinetics of AZT is changed when trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SMX/TMP) is given at the same time or whether the pharmacokinetics of SMX/TMP is altered by AZT given at the same time. AZT has been effective in treating HIV infection in some patients with AIDS and SMX/TMP is an antibiotic combination which is useful in preventing or treating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). It is important to know how drugs interact in patients because addition of a second drug may change the speed at which a drug is eliminated from the body and cause increased toxic effects or decreased therapeutic effects.    ,NCT00000734
HIV,A Clinical Trial To Evaluate the Toxicity and Antiviral Effects of a Range of Doses of Ampligen in p24 Antigen Positive HIV-Infected Patients With AIDS or ARC, To determine the safety of intravenous infusion of ampligen in symptomatic HIV-infected patients at several dose levels to determine the maximum dose that can be tolerated and to measure the effects of ampligen on the HIV virus infection immune function and clinical condition. Ampligen is a suitable drug for clinical trials against HIV because it has been shown to stimulate the immune system and to inhibit replication of HIV in vitro at doses that can be achieved without noticeable harmful side effects.    ,NCT00000735
HIV,Safety and Efficacy of Zidovudine for Asymptomatic HIV-Infected Individuals, To determine if treatment with zidovudine (AZT) will delay or prevent the onset of AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) in individuals infected with HIV but who do not have symptoms of AIDS or ARC. Also to compare the dose of AZT found to be useful in AIDS and severe ARC with a lower dose to see if side effects can be reduced. Results from several studies show that a high percentage of people infected with HIV will eventually develop AIDS or ARC unless an effective treatment is found. Because AZT is known to prolong survival in patients with AIDS or severe ARC and has acceptable toxicity in advanced disease it is reasonable to try it in less advanced cases.    ,NCT00000736
HIV,A Phase I Concentration-Controlled Trial to Assess the Safety Tolerance Pharmacokinetics and Development of Decreased HIV-1 Susceptibility to the Combination of Atevirdine Mesylate (U-87201E) Zidovudine (AZT) and Didanosine (ddI), Part I: To determine the pharmacokinetic dose for atevirdine mesylate ( U-87201E ) when used in combination with zidovudine ( AZT ). To determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of U-87201E and AZT over a 12-week period. Part II: To determine whether or not decreased viral susceptibility to U-87201E develops when the drug is administered concomitantly with AZT for 12 weeks. Part III: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic effects of ddI/AZT/U-87201E therapy and to assess changes in viral susceptibility to U-87201E. Interest exists in the development of antiretroviral agents that possess different mechanisms of action from nucleoside analogs such as AZT. U-87201E is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor that has demonstrated activity against HIV-1; however an emerging characteristic of non-nucleoside RT inhibitors is the development of rapid resistance to HIV isolates. Whether this resistance can be prevented in the presence of nucleoside analogs such as AZT and ddI has yet to be determined.    ,NCT00000742
HIV,A Phase I Dose-Escalating Safety and Tolerance Study of sCD4-PE40 in HIV-Infected Persons, To determine the safety and tolerance of alvircept sudotox (sCD4-PE40) given at various dosing intervals and concentrations. To determine whether frequent dosing alters immunogenicity or toxicity. To obtain preliminary data to ascertain whether sCD4-PE40 has activity against HIV in human subjects. To determine whether there is any additive toxicity with combined use of sCD4-PE40 and zidovudine (AZT). There is some evidence that AZT and sCD4-PE40 an experimental drug with anti-HIV activity previously demonstrated in vitro may produce increased benefit when used in combination in HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT00000743
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein gp160, To determine the reactivity and safety of HIV-1 recombinant envelope glycoprotein gp160. To determine the immunogenicity of gp160. Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS there is currently no cure. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease will depend on the development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.    ,NCT00000745
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Recombinant Vaccinia-HIV Envelope Vaccine (HIVAC-1e) in Combination With a Panel of Subunit Recombinant HIV Envelope Vaccines, Primary: To determine in healthy volunteers whether priming with a vaccinia HIV-1 gp160 envelope gene recombinant vaccine (HIVAC-1e) followed by boosting with one of two subunit recombinant HIV-1 envelope vaccines (Env 2-3 and gp120) provides enhanced immunogenicity compared to vaccination with the gp120 subunit vaccine alone. (Per 10/01/92 amendment boosts with VaxSyn (gp160) were eliminated.) To evaluate the immunogenicity of one versus two priming doses of HIVAC-1e prior to a boost with gp120. To compare the relative immunogenicity of the three subunit vaccines when administered as boosters. Secondary: To examine the safety of administering the individual subunit vaccines in combination with HIVAC-1e and the safety of administering the gp120 subunit vaccine alone. In a previous study of candidate HIV vaccines the evidence suggested that administration of a booster vaccination with a different vaccine preparation may produce a better immune response than administration of HIVAC-1e vaccine alone.    ,NCT00000746
HIV,An Open-Label Pilot Study to Evaluate the Development of Resistance to Nevirapine (BI-RG-587) in HIV-Infected Patients With CD4 Cell Count >= 500/mm3, Primary: To evaluate the rate of development of resistance to nevirapine in HIV-1 infected individuals. To evaluate safety of nevirapine in HIV-1 infected individuals with CD4 counts greater than or equal to 500 cells/mm3. Secondary: To evaluate the effect of nevirapine on surrogate markers. The anti-HIV agent nevirapine is associated with rapid emergence of resistance when administered alone or in combination with zidovudine to HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts <= 400 cells/mm3. In persons with less advanced HIV disease and less viral burden the emergence of resistance may be delayed thus permitting evaluation for beneficial effect in a population where there is currently no established therapy.    ,NCT00000747
HIV,A Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 200 Mcg of gp120 (CHO) BIOCINE in MF59 Emulsion Versus the Emulsion Control: Three Injections at 0 1 and 6 Months, To evaluate in healthy volunteers the safety and immune response to 200 mcg gp120 candidate vaccine in MF59 emulsion without MTP-PE at 0 1 and 6 months. Preliminary evaluations of two dose levels of gp120 administered to volunteers in protocol VEU 007A indicate that a gp120 dose of potentially greater immunogenicity may be of interest.    ,NCT00000749
HIV,A Phase III Study to Evaluate the Safety Tolerance and Efficacy of Early Treatment With Zidovudine (AZT) in Asymptomatic Infants With HIV Infection, Primary: To determine the efficacy of early treatment with zidovudine (AZT) in HIV-infected asymptomatic infants. To determine the safety and tolerance of AZT in this patient population. Secondary: To compare the virologic and immunologic parameters between the treatment groups. To determine the efficacy of AZT as an early treatment to prevent development of CD4+ cell depletion in HIV-infected asymptomatic infants. AZT is currently indicated for primary treatment in children with HIV-associated signs and symptoms and for those with significant immunodeficiency. This study will attempt to determine whether early treatment with AZT prevents the development of symptoms in HIV-infected infants who are asymptomatic.    ,NCT00000750
HIV,A Phase III Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Study of the Use of Anti-HIV Immune Serum Globulin (HIVIG) for the Prevention of Maternal-Fetal HIV Transmission in Pregnant Women and Newborns Receiving Zidovudine (AZT), To evaluate the effect of anti-HIV immune serum globulin (HIVIG) versus immune globulin (IVIG) administered during pregnancy and to the newborn in combination with zidovudine (AZT) administered intrapartum and to the newborn on incidence of HIV infection in infants born to HIV-infected women who received AZT during pregnancy for medical indications. Vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child may occur before during or after parturition (via breast-feeding). It is believed that therapy administered both during pregnancy and intrapartum may help prevent vertical transmission. Additionally adjunctive short-term antiretroviral therapy for the newborn following the intensive viral exposure presumed to occur at birth may be necessary.    ,NCT00000751
HIV,Preventing Frequent Sinus Infections in HIV-Infected Patients, To evaluate the additional effectiveness of an anti-inflammatory nasal spray ( beclomethasone dipropionate ) and a broad spectrum antibiotic ( cefuroxime axetil ) over decongestant ( Deconsal II ) alone when these agents are given individually or in combination for the prevention of recurrent paranasal sinus infection in patients with HIV infection. To compare the clinical utility of paranasal sinus radiographs with computed tomograms (CTs) in the evaluation and management of HIV-infected patients with recurrent paranasal sinus infection. To determine relevant prognostic factors and the microbiologic etiology of maxillary sinusitis in this patient population. Sinusitis is common among HIV-infected patients and is likely to be recurrent or refractory to traditional therapy particularly in patients with advanced immunosuppression. An intervention aimed at prevention of recurrent sinus disease in HIV-infected patients appears to be warranted.    ,NCT00000752
HIV,A Phase I Concentration-Targeted Multidose Study of Atevirdine Mesylate ( U-87201E ) AZT and ddI or ddC, To determine the safety toxicity pharmacokinetic profile and antiretroviral activity of atevirdine mesylate ( U-87201E ) in HIV-infected patients. Per 06/04/93 amendment to also evaluate the interactive effects of didanosine ( ddI ) or zalcitabine ( dideoxycytidine; ddC ) with zidovudine ( AZT ) on the pharmacokinetics of U-87201E and to assess the effects of the triple combination therapies on immunologic and virologic parameters. Since the use of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as U-87201E has been associated with the rapid development of resistant HIV isolates an initial evaluation of this drug in patients was made in combination with AZT. Because of the inability to detect resistance after 6 weeks of combined AZT/U-87201E therapy this protocol will initially investigate U-87201E administered alone and then investigate the effect of this drug with AZT and ddI or ddC.    ,NCT00000753
HIV,A Randomized Phase II Study of Two Doses of Interferon Alfa-2a (IFN Alfa-2a) in Combination With Zidovudine (AZT) and Dideoxycytidine (ddC) Versus AZT and ddC Only in Patients With HIV Infection and Less Than 400 CD4 Cells/mm3, To determine the safety and efficacy of two doses of interferon alfa-2a ( IFN alfa-2a ) in combination with zidovudine ( AZT )/zalcitabine ( ddC ) versus AZT/ddC only in patients with HIV infection and CD4 count < 400 cells/mm3. AZT and ddC inhibit HIV by acting as reverse transcriptase chain terminators while IFN alfa-2a inhibits translation of viral proteins. Combining agents that act at different sites of viral replication may improve HIV inhibition and produce more effective and sustained anti-HIV effects.    ,NCT00000754
HIV,A Phase I/II Trial of Vaccine Therapy of HIV-1 Infected Individuals With 50-500 CD4 Cells/mm3, To examine the response of HIV-1 infected patients to vaccination with gp120/HIV-1MN antigen. To determine the effect of antiretroviral therapy on vaccine responsiveness. Fifty percent of HIV-1 infected individuals remain symptom free for 8-12 years. It has been hypothesized that HIV-specific immune responses are responsible for the period of relative quiescence of viral replication. Recent studies suggest that these immune functions can be augmented by vaccination with HIV-derived antigens.    ,NCT00000755
HIV,Evaluation of the Safety and Tolerance of Immunotherapy With Autologous Ex-Vivo Expanded HIV-Specific Cytotoxic T-Cells in HIV-Infected Patients With CD4+ Counts Between 100-400/mm3, To determine the safety tolerance and feasibility of adoptive immunotherapy with autologous cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts between 100 and 400; to evaluate the immunologic virologic and clinical changes for up to 24 weeks following infusion of study therapy. Freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes from HIV-1-seropositive individuals frequently lyse autologous HIV-1-expressing cells or autologous cells infected with vaccinia vectors encoding HIV-1-specific proteins. Administration of these cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) may help prevent HIV disease progression.    ,NCT00000756
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein gp160, To evaluate the safety and immune response to 160 mcg HIV-1 recombinant envelope glycoprotein gp160. To evaluate the duration of antibody response and its relationship to dose and frequency of inoculation. Evaluation of previous patients who received doses of 40 or 80 mcg gp160 vaccine indicate that although serum anti-gp160 antibody responses were detected the level and duration of those responses were limited. A preliminary observation suggests that weak functional antibody responses may develop following the 18 month booster of 40 or 80 mcg; therefore a dose of gp160 vaccine having potentially greater immunogenicity is of particular interest.    ,NCT00000757
HIV,A Phase III Randomized Trial of Topical Vaginal Fluorouracil (5-Fluorouracil 5-FU) Maintenance Therapy Versus Observation After Standard Treatment for High-Grade Cervical Dysplasia in HIV-Infected Women, To determine the efficacy and safety of intravaginal fluorouracil administered as prophylaxis in HIV-infected women who have received standard ablative therapy (surgery) for high-grade cervical dysplasia (pre-cancer of the cervix; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). To correlate time to recurrence of cervical dysplasia with T-cell function. Women with HIV infection are at greater risk for cervical dysplasia. Because of the likelihood that untreated or recurrent cervical dysplasia may progress to invasive cancer there is an urgent need to develop appropriate therapies.    ,NCT00000758
HIV,Neurodevelopmental and Neurological Study of Infants and Children With HIV-1 Infection and AIDS in Clinical Trials, AS PER AMENDMENT 10/24/96: To develop a domain/construct-driven neuropsychological and neurological battery. Scaling of instruments to allow measurement of functions from infancy to early adulthood; establish reliability and validity of the new instruments developed for the NIMH Neurodevelopmental Battery. Downward extension of cognitive domains into infancy and early childhood. To describe and compare outcomes when assessing level of development versus rate of change. Describe and compare the outcomes from a global assessment of neurodevelopment (e.g. a standardized I.Q. score) versus discrete assessments (e.g. functional domains such as motor or language skills). Develop guidelines for multicultural neuropsychological and neurological assessment within a clinical trials design. Describe the nature of impaired developmental abilities and course of the disease in infants and children. The assessment of children who sustain central nervous system (CNS) insult requires approaches that differ in several ways from adult-based assessment. The rapid changes that occur in the developing CNS as well as in behavior reflect underlying processes of growth and development.    ,NCT00000759
HIV,A Randomized Study of Activity Safety and Tolerance of Oral Ro 24-7429 (Tat Antagonist) in Patients With HIV Infection, To study the anti-HIV activity of the various doses of Ro 24-7429 monotherapy based on virologic and immunologic endpoints. To study the safety and tolerance of Ro 24-7429. To explore relationships between exposure to Ro 24-7429 and its metabolites and antiviral activity and drug toxicity. To determine a safe tolerable and active dose regimen of Ro 24-7429 and to make preliminary observations of Ro 24-7429 in combination with another antiretroviral nucleoside. The HIV genome contains a number of genes that regulate viral replication. Control of the activity of these genes and their encoded proteins represents a potential target for development of new antiretroviral drugs. The tat (transactivator of transcription of HIV) antagonist Ro 24-7429 is the first compound for clinical testing that utilizes this approach for therapy of HIV infection.    ,NCT00000760
HIV,Phase I/II Study of Recombinant Human Interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) in HIV-Infected Children, PRIMARY: To determine the safety and toxicity of recombinant interferon gamma-1b ( rIFN-gamma ) in HIV-infected children receiving ongoing zidovudine ( AZT ) or didanosine ( ddI ) therapy. To document HIV-associated defects in neutrophil and/or monocyte function that are improved with rIFN-gamma. SECONDARY: To determine whether a change in CD4 cell count occurs and to assess virologic status and effects on AZT and ddI pharmacokinetics. It is likely that infants and children severely immunocompromised by HIV infection would respond to immunomodulators that augment different portions of the host defense system. Interferon-gamma has been shown to benefit children with severely compromised nonspecific immunity and may thus be of benefit to those with HIV infection.    ,NCT00000761
HIV,A Placebo-Controlled Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Recombinant Envelope Proteins of HIV-1 gp160 and gp120 in Children >= 1 Month Old With Asymptomatic HIV Infection, To determine the safety and immunogenicity of gp160 (MicroGeneSys) rgp120/HIV-1MN (Genentech) and rgp120/HIV-1SF2 (BIOCINE) and their adjuvants in HIV-infected children 1 month to 18 years of age. The initiation of this immunotherapy trial will provide multiple benefits by assessing in asymptomatic HIV-infected children a therapy currently being tested in their adult counterparts in the hope of forestalling the progression of HIV immunosuppression and clinical disease.    ,NCT00000762
HIV,Chemoprevention of Anal Neoplasia Arising Secondary to Anogenital Human Papillomavirus Infection in Persons With HIV Infection., PRIMARY: In Phase I to define a broadly tolerable dose of isotretinoin that can be used in combination with interferon alfa-2a (IFN alfa-2a). In Phase II to determine trends in efficacy of isotretinoin alone or in combination with IFN alfa-2a as chemoprevention (preventing progression or recurrence) of anal intraepithelial neoplasia ( AIN ) / squamous intraepithelial lesions ( SIL ) in patients with HIV infection. SECONDARY: To evaluate the effects of isotretinoin alone or in combination with IFN alfa-2a on immune function markers human papillomavirus (HPV) type and HPV DNA levels. Patients with HIV infection have a significant risk of recurrence following local ablation of intraepithelial neoplasia; thus anogenital epithelial may become an increasingly important cause of morbidity and possibly mortality as the HIV epidemic matures. Clinical studies of non-HIV-infected subjects have established that synthetic retinoids inhibit the progression of epithelial preneoplastic conditions and some neoplastic states.    ,NCT00000764
HIV,Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Zidovudine in Preventing CD4+ Lymphocyte Decline in Patients With Primary HIV Infection. (One Treatment Arm Receives Placebo), To evaluate the safety and efficacy of early treatment with zidovudine for preventing a decline in CD4+ lymphocyte counts in patients with primary HIV infection. To determine the natural history of virologic and immunologic changes in primary HIV infection. Previous studies indicate that intervention with zidovudine during primary HIV infection could reduce the initial viral burden and subsequent decline in immune functions and could prolong not only the time to development of AIDS but also the time to initiation of chronic antiretroviral therapy.    ,NCT00000765
HIV,A Multicenter Randomized Placebo-Controlled Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Recombinant Vaccinia-HIV-1 IIIB Env/Gag/Pol Vaccine (TBC-3B), To evaluate in healthy HIV-1 seronegative vaccinia-immune and vaccinia-naive volunteers the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV-1 candidate vaccine (TBC-3B) consisting of a live recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the env gag and pol genes of HIV-1 IIIB strain. To evaluate the potential of boosting with one of a variety of HIV-1 recombinant subunit peptide or pseudovirion vaccines if available to augment the immune responses of the vaccinees. Antigenic drift defined as the genetic variation of the HIV-1 envelope gene that results in antigenic variation during natural infection may confound attempts to achieve protective immunity using a vaccine based solely on HIV-1 envelope proteins. Inclusion of conserved core and polymerase proteins along with envelope protein in a candidate vaccine may address some of the problems with antigenic variability. A prime-boost immunization approach using a novel priming immunogen expressing env gag and pol genes of the HIV-1 IIIB strain will be attempted in this study.    ,NCT00000767
HIV,A Comparative Study of a Combination of Zidovudine Didanosine and Double-Blinded Nevirapine Versus a Combination of Zidovudine and Didanosine, To assess the safety and toxicity of zidovudine (AZT)/didanosine (ddI) versus AZT/ddI combined with nevirapine in HIV-infected patients and to obtain preliminary anti-HIV activity data using immunologic and virologic markers. Previous in vitro studies suggest that HIV that has already developed resistance to AZT and ddI is less able to develop resistance to nevirapine a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Thus convergent combination therapy with these three drugs in HIV-infected patients may prove more effective.    ,NCT00000770
HIV,A Phase I Open-Label Study of the Safety Tolerance and Pharmacokinetic Interactions of Combination Didanosine and Ribavirin in HIV-Positive Individuals, To evaluate the safety and tolerance of concurrent administration of standard-dose didanosine (ddI) with low-dose ribavirin in HIV-positive patients. To determine the pharmacokinetic interactions of concurrent administration of ddI and ribavirin and correlate pharmacokinetic parameters with toxicity. To investigate antiviral activity of the combined regimen. Combination ddI/ribavirin therapy if safe and effective offers an alternative combination antiretroviral regimen for patients unable to tolerate regimens containing zidovudine (AZT).    ,NCT00000772
HIV,A Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Recombinant HIV-1 Envelope Antigen in Children Born to HIV-Infected Mothers, PRIMARY: To determine the safety of envelope recombinant proteins rgp120/HIV-1MN (Genentech) and rgp120/HIV-1SF2 (Chiron/Biocine) in infants who are of indeterminate HIV status born to HIV-infected women. To evaluate changes in viral load in infants proven to be infected and absolute CD4 counts in all immunized infants. SECONDARY: To evaluate the immunogenicity of these envelope recombinant proteins in infants of indeterminate HIV status born to HIV-infected women. Only 30-50 percent of HIV-infected infants have detectable virus at birth. Successful early sensitization to HIV envelope epitopes may help prevent infection or alternatively may enhance HIV-specific immune function to alter HIV replication and disease progression.    ,NCT00000774
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of UBI SynVac (HIV-1 MN Octameric V3 Peptide Vaccine), To determine the safety immunogenicity and optimal dose of rgp120/HIV-1MN octameric V3 peptide vaccine (SynVac) in healthy volunteers. It is likely that the ultimate control of AIDS will depend on the development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV-1. SynVac is a synthetic candidate vaccine based on eight V3-derived peptides attached to a heptalysyl core to form radial octamers. In animal studies the vaccine appears safe and demonstrates the capability for producing immune responses.    ,NCT00000775
HIV,Active Immunization of HIV-1 Infected Pregnant Women With CD4 Lymphocyte Counts >= 400/mm3: A Phase I Study of Safety and Immunogenicity of VaxSyn Recombinant gp160 (NOTE: Some Patients Receive Placebo), To evaluate the safety of gp160 vaccine (VaxSyn) in HIV-1 infected pregnant women with CD4 counts >= 400 cells/mm3. To evaluate the immunogenicity of this vaccine in pregnant women and the passive acquisition of vaccine-specific antibody in their infants. Evidence suggests that an advanced stage of disease with high plasma viremia is associated with increased transmission of HIV-1 to the fetus. Slowing the progression of disease reducing the titer of virus in plasma and increasing the titer of epitope-specific antibody are potentially attainable goals through active immunization of the mother during pregnancy.    ,NCT00000777
HIV,A Pilot Study of Methodology to Rapidly Evaluate Drugs for Bactericidal Activity Tolerance and Pharmacokinetics in the Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis Using Isoniazid and Levofloxacin, To evaluate the methodology for rapidly determining the early bactericidal activity (EBA) tolerance and pharmacokinetics of isoniazid and levofloxacin in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Traditionally in trials for treatment of TB a new drug is administered in combination with two or more other antituberculous agents of known effectiveness over a long period of time. In this setting it is difficult to determine the effect of any single drug or dose level. Development of new agents for the treatment of TB may be accelerated by a methodology in which a new agent could be evaluated for activity by administering it as a single agent over a short time period. This study utilizes a method to measure the amount of bacteria present each day in the lungs.    ,NCT00000778
HIV,A Phase I Comparative Blinded Trial of Several HIV-1 Derived Immunogens in Infected Individuals With >= 500 CD4 Cells/mm3, PRIMARY: To compare the immunogenicity and safety of each of several HIV-1 derived immunogens versus control in HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts greater than or equal to 500 cells/mm3. SECONDARY: To determine whether significant advantages to any one vaccine exist. Before large clinical trials of anti-HIV vaccines are undertaken it is important to determine whether there are significant advantages to any one of the vaccines currently offered for such studies.    ,NCT00000779
HIV,"A ""Pre-Enrollment"" Protocol for HIV-Infected Adolescents", PRIMARY: To identify characterize and co-enroll HIV-infected adolescents into existing and future ACTG (or other NIH-sponsored) HIV treatment protocols through the systematic and recurrent assessment of eligibility. To assess the ability of adolescents enrolled in ACTG 220 to adhere to ACTG (or other NIH-sponsored) HIV treatment protocols; and to define factors that influence the adolescent's ability to enter or adhere to study protocols. SECONDARY: To describe the nature stage and progression of HIV infection in adolescents. Little is known about HIV-infected adolescents as a group and as a result small numbers of them are currently enrolled in ACTG drug studies. Creative approaches are needed to encourage enrollment of HIV-infected adolescents whose socio-demographic profile has made access to NIH-sponsored research unlikely.    ,NCT00000780
HIV,A Randomized Double-Blind Four-Arm Study Comparing Combination Nucleoside Alternating Nucleoside and Triple-Drug Therapy for the Treatment of Advanced HIV Disease (CD4 <= 50/mm3), To determine the relative clinical efficacy of zidovudine ( AZT ) plus didanosine (ddI) AZT plus zalcitabine ( ddC ) AZT alternating monthly with ddI and AZT/ddI plus nevirapine in HIV-infected patients with advanced disease. The rapid emergence of resistant HIV strains has been observed in patients receiving monotherapy with a nucleoside analog or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Use of combination therapy with two nucleoside drugs or convergent combination therapy with two nucleosides and a non-nucleoside RT inhibitor may minimize the evolution of these resistant HIV strains. Since toxicity is a major problem in patients with advanced disease who are receiving combination nucleoside therapy alternating the two drugs may provide a way of retaining several benefits of combination therapy while minimizing the increased toxicity.    ,NCT00000781
HIV,A Phase I/II Study of Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) Reactions to Intradermal HIV Envelope Antigen, To determine the frequency of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions in HIV-positive patients to two doses of two envelope glycoprotein antigens prepared differently. To determine whether patients who have previously demonstrated a DTH response to intradermal MGStage HIV-1 gp160 IIIB baculovirus (MicroGeneSys) have a reproducible response to a repeat injection of gp160 and whether there is cross-reactivity to intradermal HIV-1 rgp160 IIIB vero cell expressed (Immuno-AG). PER 4/5/95 AMENDMENT: To also determine whether patients who respond to HIV-1 rgp160 IIIB baculovirus (MicroGeneSys) have cross-reactivity to intradermal skin tests of HIV-1 rgp160 MN (Immuno-AG). Previous studies in individuals immunized with gp160 suggest that a skin test response in immunized patients can be used as a surrogate marker for new proliferative and cytotoxic responses induced by vaccination.    ,NCT00000782
HIV,Heterosexual HIV Transmission Study (HATS), PRIMARY: To identify sexual behaviors and biological factors associated with an increased risk of heterosexual HIV transmission. SECONDARY: To assess the effect of safer sex counseling on behavior of sexually active heterosexuals in which one member of the couple is infected with HIV. To create a repository of serum peripheral blood mononuclear cells semen and cervico-vaginal washings from heterosexual couples who are concordant (both partners HIV infected) and discordant (one partner HIV infected) with respect to HIV infection. In the United States the number of AIDS cases attributed to heterosexual transmission although still a small percentage of the total number of reported cases is the most rapidly growing category. The rate at which HIV is transmitted between heterosexual couples and the factors that may impede or enhance heterosexual transmission are important to understanding and slowing the worldwide HIV epidemic.    ,NCT00000783
HIV,A Registry of Tuberculosis Cases in the CPCRA, PRIMARY: To estimate the proportion of tuberculosis patients in the CPCRA who have drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and to describe the patterns of drug resistance. SECONDARY: To compare drug resistance data on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates of HIV-infected patients to those of HIV-uninfected patients who are being followed in the CPCRA. To assess the relationship of resistance data with geographic demographic and HIV and TB risk factor information. Geographic areas and demographic subgroups affected by the TB epidemic appear to be congruent and associated with the concurrent HIV epidemic. The total number of CPCRA patients who will develop or who have experienced confirmed TB is unknown. It is critical to determine the depth and breadth of the current problem of drug-resistant TB.    ,NCT00000785
HIV,Heterosexual HIV Transmission Study (HATS). Prospective Cohort Study, PRIMARY: To identify factors associated with risk of HIV infection through heterosexual activity among urban inner-city women. SECONDARY: To identify correlates of high-risk behaviors in order to provide a basis for future intervention studies.    ,NCT00000787
HIV,A Randomized Comparative Trial of Zidovudine (AZT) Versus 2'3'-Didehydro-3'-Deoxythymidine (Stavudine; d4T) in Children With HIV Infection, PRIMARY: To compare the relative safety and tolerance of oral zidovudine (AZT) versus oral stavudine (d4T) in symptomatic HIV-infected children. SECONDARY: To compare the clinical virologic and immunologic responses between the two treatment groups and to obtain pharmacokinetic data for both drugs. At present AZT is considered the drug of choice for initial treatment of most children with HIV infection although disease progression or drug intolerance is associated with its long-term use. In preliminary studies in children d4T another HIV inhibitor has been well tolerated although an optimum dose has not been determined.    ,NCT00000789
HIV,Thalidomide for Treatment of Oral and Esophageal Aphthous Ulcers and HIV Viremia in Patients With HIV Infection, PRIMARY: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of thalidomide for treatment of oral and esophageal aphthous ulcers (those unrelated to a known infection or malignancy) in patients with advanced HIV disease. To evaluate the effect of thalidomide on HIV load in this patient population. Per 06/28/94 amendment to evaluate the effectiveness of thalidomide in preventing recurrences in patients whose aphthae completely heal at the end of acute treatment. SECONDARY: To evaluate the effect of thalidomide on blood tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels and to obtain pharmacokinetic data on the drug. Per 06/28/94 amendment to evaluate the safety of thalidomide. Per 05/10/95 amendment to explore in a substudy the effects of thalidomide on idiopathic genital aphthous ulcers in HIV-infected women. Aphthous ulcers of the mouth or esophagus can interfere with eating resulting in malnutrition and wasting. Thalidomide has been proposed as an effective therapy for severe forms of aphthous ulceration in AIDS patients.    ,NCT00000790
HIV,A Phase II Double-Blind Study of Two Doses of SC-49483 in Combination With Zidovudine (ZDV) Versus ZDV, To determine the safety and anti-HIV activity of two doses of SC-49483 in combination with zidovudine (AZT) versus AZT alone. To determine the influences of viral phenotype on the anti-HIV activity of these treatment regimens. SC-49483 has no inherent activity against HIV-1 but is converted in the intestinal wall to SC-48334 which has demonstrated anti-HIV activity. Since SC-49483 causes significantly less gastrointestinal toxicity than SC-48334 the combination of SC-49483 with AZT may improve the benefits of both drugs in patients with HIV infection.    ,NCT00000791
HIV,A Pharmacologically Guided Phase I/II Study of Daily Orally Administered Synthetic Hypericin in HIV-Infected Subjects, To determine the safety and tolerance of daily oral hypericin when given to achieve target trough levels within defined cohorts. To determine the responses of surrogate markers of HIV infection to daily oral hypericin. It is not known whether daily oral dosing will produce a tolerable prolonged exposure to therapeutic levels of hypericin. Pharmacokinetic modeling studies have demonstrated that daily oral dosing should produce a trough level in a desired range without excessive peak levels.    ,NCT00000792
HIV,A Phase II/III Double-Blind Study of Amitriptyline and Mexiletine for Painful Neuropathy in HIV Infection, To assess the efficacy safety and tolerability of amitriptyline hydrochloride versus mexiletine hydrochloride in reducing pain intensity in patients with HIV-related painful peripheral neuropathy. No large-scale controlled clinical trials of symptomatic therapy for painful HIV-related neuropathy have been attempted. Both amitriptyline and mexiletine have been useful in the management of painful neuropathies; however both are associated with certain toxicities. In this comparative study of amitriptyline and mexiletine benztropine mesylate also will be included as an active placebo to mimic the side effects of the study drugs.    ,NCT00000793
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of UBI Multivalent HIV-1 Peptide Immunogen in HIV-1 Seronegative Human Subjects, To evaluate in healthy adult volunteers the safety and immunogenicity of multivalent HIV-1 peptide immunogen a formulation of HIV-1 gp120 principal neutralizing domain (PND) branched synthetic peptides from 15 viral strains representative of diverse worldwide isolates. Because there is considerable variation among HIV-1 virus strains from differing geographical locations worldwide a multivalent peptide vaccine has been constructed to include prevalent and divergent isolates potentially providing for wide coverage of geographically isolated epidemics.    ,NCT00000795
HIV,A Prospective Study of Multidrug Resistance and a Pilot Study of the Safety of and Clinical and Microbiologic Response to Levofloxacin in Combination With Other Antimycobacterial Drugs for Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis (MDRTB) in HIV-Infected Patients., To determine the demographic behavioral clinical and geographic risk factors associated with the occurrence of multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDRTB). To evaluate the clinical and microbiological responses and overall survival of MDRTB patients who are treated with levofloxacin-containing multiple-drug regimens chosen from a hierarchical list. Per 9/28/94 amendment to assess whether persistent or recurrent positive sputum cultures of patients who show failure or relapse are due to the same strain or reinfection with a new strain. Among TB patients there has been an increase in progressive disease due to the emergence of antimycobacterial drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Failure to identify patients at high risk for MDRTB increases the hazard for both treatment failure and development of resistance to additional therapeutic agents. Efforts to improve survival in patients with MDRTB will depend on improved methods of assessing the risk of acquisition of MDRTB and identifying drug susceptibility patterns in a timely fashion.    ,NCT00000796
HIV,Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), The Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) a multicenter prospective study was established in August 1993 to carry out comprehensive investigations of the impact of HIV infection and its clinical laboratory and psychosocial effects in women. The purpose of this study is to collect and evaluate these data from HIV infected and at-risk women to better understand and provide support for women whom are currently HIV infected or who are at risk for HIV infection.    ,NCT00000797
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of UBI Microparticulate Monovalent HIV-1 MN Peptide Immunogen in HIV-1 Seronegative Human Subjects, To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a new microparticulate formulation of an HIV-1 MN PND peptide for oral administration in healthy HIV-1 seronegative adult volunteers at low risk for infection. Vaccine formulations of synthetic peptides adsorbed to alum may not provide other requisite characteristics of an effective HIV vaccine such as induction of mucosal immunity production of cytotoxic T cells and ease of administration. An oral microparticulate vaccine containing a prototype synthetic peptide has been developed. The microparticles can be degraded over time inducing both secretory and systemic immune responses.    ,NCT00000798
HIV,Methadone Effects on Zidovudine (ZDV AZT) Disposition, To determine whether methadone maintenance alters the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine (AZT). To determine whether any such effect of methadone on disposition of AZT is time dependent and whether a metabolic interaction between AZT and methadone exists. Injection drug users represent an increasing proportion of HIV-infected persons. Since daily methadone maintenance is the major chemical treatment for injection drug abuse it is important to determine the impact of methadone on AZT absorption distribution and elimination.    ,NCT00000800
HIV,A Phase II Double-Blind Study of Delavirdine Mesylate ( U-90152 ) in Combination With Zidovudine ( AZT ) and/or Didanosine ( ddI ) Versus AZT and ddI Combination Therapy, To determine the safety and anti-HIV activity of delavirdine mesylate ( U-90152 ) in combination with zidovudine ( AZT ) and/or didanosine ( ddI ) versus AZT/ddI combination. U-90152 has demonstrated anti-HIV activity. Since the combination of this drug with either AZT or ddI has synergistic inhibitory activity against HIV-1 in vitro and triple therapy appears to have greater inhibitory activity against HIV-1 in vitro than dual therapy the use of U-90152 in combination with AZT and/or ddI may improve the benefits of these drugs in persons with HIV disease.    ,NCT00000803
HIV,A Randomized Trial of L-735524 An Inhibitor of the HIV Protease Enzyme and Interleukin-2 in Persons Infected With HIV (NOTE: Only For Patients Who Previously Completed NIAID 93 CC-113), The purpose of this trial is to study L-735524 which is an inhibitor of the HIV protease enzyme. It will be used with interleukin-2 in patients infected with HIV.    ,NCT00000804
HIV,A Phase I Randomized Dose/Formulation Comparison Study of SC-52151, PRIMARY: To evaluate the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and ethanol exposure of two dose regimens and formulations of SC-52151. SECONDARY: To evaluate the preliminary anti-HIV activity of these treatment regimens and the relationship between day 14 plasma concentrations of SC-52151 and immunological and virological markers and toxicity. Since viral isolates with decreased susceptibility to the protease inhibitor SC-52151 occur in vitro after multiple passages and since prolonged post infectious effects occur in vitro comparison of two formulations an elixir and a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) is needed to determine the appropriate dose formulation for Phase II studies.    ,NCT00000806
HIV,A Phase I Study of Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Nevirapine in HIV-1 Infected Pregnant Women and Neonates Born to HIV-1 Infected Mothers, To determine the bioavailability pharmacokinetics and short-term safety and tolerance of nevirapine in HIV-1 infected pregnant women and their newborns when nevirapine is given to the mother during active labor and when their neonates are dosed during the first week of life. To determine the short-term safety profile of mothers receiving zidovudine (AZT) who received nevirapine during active labor and their neonates who received no dose a single dose or multiple doses of nevirapine and who are receiving AZT during the first 6 weeks of life. Treatment of HIV-1 infected pregnant women during active labor may result in therapeutic levels of nevirapine in the neonate at the time of exposure to HIV-1 during parturition decreasing the neonate's risk of infection.    ,NCT00000808
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Two Different Formulations of an HIV Vaccine in Infants Born to HIV-Infected Women, The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of two different formulations of an HIV vaccine in infants born to HIV-infected women.    ,NCT00000809
HIV,Randomized Phase I/II Dose-Ranging Open-Label Trial of the Anti-HIV Activity of Delavirdine Mesylate (DLV; U-90152S), PRIMARY: To study the safety and tolerance of delavirdine mesylate ( U-90152 ) monotherapy. To compare the anti-HIV activity of three blood concentration levels of this agent with nucleoside analog monotherapy either zidovudine ( AZT ) or didanosine ( ddI ) based on the reduction of HIV viral burden. SECONDARY: To use pharmacokinetic parameters to assess the relationship between daily drug exposure and antiviral activity and toxicity of the U-90152 AZT and ddI monotherapy. To assess anti-HIV activity using other disease markers. Data suggest that bisheteroarylpiperazines (BHAPs) such as delavirdine mesylate are potent and safe anti-HIV agents and may have different biological behavior than other currently available non-nucleoside RT inhibitors.    ,NCT00000810
HIV,A Phase I Placebo-Controlled Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Thalidomide in Subjects With HIV-1 Infection, PRIMARY: To evaluate the safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics of daily oral thalidomide. SECONDARY: To examine the effect of thalidomide on antiviral activity and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production and the correlation between TNF-alpha inhibition and viral burden. A protein in the blood called tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) is abnormally elevated in patients with HIV infection and may cause the body to produce more virus. In vitro studies have demonstrated that thalidomide reduces TNF-alpha levels and inhibits production of HIV. However more information on the pharmacological and immunological aspects of thalidomide is needed.    ,NCT00000812
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Live Recombinant Canarypox-gp160 MN (ALVAC vCP125 HIV-1 gp160 MN) in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Volunteers, Part A: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ALVAC vCP125 HIV-1 gp160 MN live canarypox recombinant vaccine (ALVAC gp160 MN) versus a recombinant canarypox expressing the rabies glycoprotein (ALVAC rabies glycoprotein) as a control in healthy HIV-1 uninfected adult volunteers. Part B: To evaluate the schedule of two immunizations with ALVAC gp160 MN for optimal immunogenicity. Amendment: 12/22/93: To determine whether ALVAC gp160 MN in combination with SF-2 rgp120 subunit protein is capable of generating humoral and cellular immune responses of greater intensity and longer duration than either vaccine administered alone. A canarypox-vectored vaccine (ALVAC) that expresses the gp160 antigen of the HIV-1 MN strain might satisfy many criteria for an affordable HIV vaccine. Per 12/22/93 amendment: Cellular responses have been augmented by the combination of two recombinant vaccines especially in vaccinia naive individuals.    ,NCT00000813
HIV,A Comparative Study of Combination Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents With Advanced HIV Disease, To compare the antiviral activity safety toxicity and steady-state pharmacokinetics of zidovudine didanosine and nevirapine used in combination in patients with HIV infection. The duration of clinical benefit from zidovudine (AZT) may be limited because of development of viral resistance to the drug. Use of combination antiretroviral therapy can potentially reduce viral load and prevent emergence of multidrug resistance.    ,NCT00000814
HIV,A Phase II Comparative Study of Seroconversion of Single-Dose and Two-Dose Measles Vaccination in HIV-Infected and HIV-Uninfected Children: A Multicenter Trial of the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group, To compare measles seroconversion rates (development of antibodies) at 13 months of age in HIV-infected and uninfected children on one of two immunization schedules: attenuated measles/mumps/rubella virus (M-M-R II) vaccine at 12 months versus attenuated measles vaccine (Attenuvax) at 6 months plus M-M-R II vaccine at 12 months. Recommendations for the age at vaccination should balance the need to minimize the risk of morbidity and mortality with the benefit of achieving the highest seroconversion rates. Immunizing a more intact immune system at an earlier stage of HIV infection may in turn achieve better and long-lasting measles protection. This study will help define a more effective measles vaccine regimen for children diagnosed with HIV infection and will provide greater insight into the functional status of the HIV-infected children's humoral immune system.    ,NCT00000815
HIV,The Efficacy of a Standardized Acupuncture Regimen and Amitriptyline Compared With Placebo as a Treatment for Pain Caused by Peripheral Neuropathy in HIV-Infected Patients, To evaluate the separate and combined efficacy of a standardized acupuncture regimen and amitriptyline on the relief of pain due to peripheral neuropathy and on the quality of life of HIV-infected patients. Both amitriptyline an antidepressant and acupuncture a Chinese medical approach that uses needles to relieve pain have been used successfully to reduce pain in some people. It is not known how effectively these approaches relieve or reduce pain in patients with peripheral neuropathy secondary to HIV infection.    ,NCT00000817
HIV,Evaluation of the Changes in HIV-1 Burden in Peripheral Blood and Lymphoid Tissue Following Zidovudine ( AZT ) Treatment in HIV-1-Infected Patients With CD4+ Cells Between 100 and 500 Cells/mm3., PRIMARY: To determine the effect of 8 weeks of zidovudine (AZT) treatment on the HIV-1 burden in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue in HIV-1-infected AZT-naive patients with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts between 100 and 500 cells/mm3. SECONDARY: To determine the extent to which apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs in these patients. In previous trials of AZT treatment in HIV-infected patients an antiviral effect has been clearly demonstrated by quantitative measurement of virus in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However the lymphoid tissues appear to be a major reservoir for HIV-1 and a major site of virus replication in HIV-infected persons. Further data is needed to assess the effect of treatment on viral burden and HIV-1 replication in lymphoid tissue.    ,NCT00000818
HIV,A Phase II Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial to Determine the Efficacy of Prednisone Therapy in HIV-Associated Nephropathy (HIVAN), To determine the efficacy and safety of prednisone in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy. To determine the effects of prednisone on serum creatinine urinary protein and creatinine clearance. HIV-associated nephropathy is characterized by heavy proteinuria rapidly progressive renal insufficiency and distinct nephropathologic changes. The syndrome most often occurs in patients with advanced HIV disease. Little is known about the effects of corticosteroids on the progression of HIV disease. In light of the possible beneficial effects of corticosteroids on HIV-associated nephropathy a controlled trial using prednisone is warranted.    ,NCT00000819
HIV,A Phase II Study of Low-Dose Interleukin-2 by Subcutaneous Injection in Combination With Antiretroviral Therapy Versus Antiretroviral Therapy Alone in Patients With HIV-1 Infection and at Least 3 Months Stable Antiretroviral Therapy, PRIMARY: To examine the effect of aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) on viral activity in the blood. To determine the safety of low-dose IL-2 in combination with antiretroviral therapy versus antiretroviral therapy alone. SECONDARY: To examine delayed type hypersensitivity responses to skin test antigens and antibody responses to protein and polysaccharide vaccines. The profound immune impairment that results from HIV-1 infection is due at least in part to the loss of CD4+ T cells and the cytokines these cells secrete especially IL-2 and interferon-gamma. Antiretroviral agents do not directly address the problem of immune impairment. Replacement of IL-2 at nontoxic doses may prevent or delay clinical immunosuppression and its attendant opportunistic infections. Also since patients with HIV-1 infection respond suboptimally to routine protein and polysaccharide immunizations IL-2 may provide an adjuvant effect on vaccine responses.    ,NCT00000820
HIV,Subcutaneously Administered Aldesleukin ( Interleukin-2; IL-2 ) Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients, To compare the effects of low-dose versus high-dose subcutaneous ( SC ) aldesleukin ( interleukin-2; IL-2 ) on immunologic and virologic markers in HIV-infected patients. To compare the effects of monthly versus bimonthly administration of SC IL-2 on these markers. Interleukin-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. In an initial study patients in an earlier stage of HIV-1 infection tended to tolerate SC IL-2 better than those with more advanced infections and those with higher baseline CD4+ counts tended to derive the greatest benefit.    ,NCT00000821
HIV,A Phase I/II Double-Blind Controlled Trial to Determine the Safety and Immunogenicity of HIV-1 MN rgp160 Immuno AG Vaccine Therapy in HIV-Infected Individuals With Greater Than or Equal to 500/mm3 CD4+ T Cells and 200-400/mm3 CD4+ T Cells, To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HIV-1 MN rgp160 (Immuno-AG) in HIV-infected patients. To evaluate the immunogenicity of HIV-1 MN rgp160 immunogen by lymphocyte proliferation specific antibody responses and DTH reaction. To describe the durability of the immunogen in patients who respond to the first 7 injections when they are boosted every 8 weeks for an additional 6-12 months [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/12/96: stratum 1 patients only]. To describe the ability of the immunogen to induce a response after an additional 6-12 months of injections among patients who did not respond to the first 7 injections [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/12/96: stratum 1 patients only]. HIV-specific cellular immune responses appear to play an important role in HIV disease progression since both T helper and cytotoxic function against HIV decrease with disease progression.    ,NCT00000822
HIV,A Multicenter Phase II Double-Blind Exploratory Study to Evaluate Differences Among Various Zidovudine/Didanosine Regimens on Quantitative Measures of Viral Burden in Relatively Early HIV-1 Infection, To determine the relative antiviral activity and safety of zidovudine ( AZT ) and didanosine ( ddI ) alone and in combination as well as in various sequences of administration. The relative efficacy of the approved antiretrovirals in early HIV-1 disease is unclear; thus a study is needed to evaluate the ability of these various nucleoside analogs to limit pathogenicity.    ,NCT00000823
HIV,A Study of Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients, To define the safety of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated from sibling-supplied dendritic cells and lymphocytes and infused into an HIV-infected patient. To determine the efficacy of these CTLs in helping the immune system to fight HIV. With lower CD4 counts HIV-infected patients may not be able to produce dendritic cells and lymphocytes special types of immune cells that generate HIV-specific CTLs. Infusion of CTLs generated from the dendritic cells and lymphocytes of an HIV-negative sibling may enable the body to recognize HIV more readily and increase immune response against the virus.    ,NCT00000824
HIV,The Effects of Giving Interleukin-2 (IL-2) Plus Anti-HIV Therapy to HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Cell Counts of at Least 350 Cells/mm3, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of giving IL-2 plus anti-HIV (antiretroviral) therapy to HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell counts (cells of the immune system that fight infection) of at least 350 cells/mm3. This study will also examine the ability of antiretroviral therapy combined with IL-2 to boost the immune system. IL-2 given through injection under the skin in combination with anti-HIV therapy can increase CD4 cell counts. This study examines 3 doses of IL-2 in order to determine the safest and most effective dose to use.    ,NCT00000825
HIV,A Phase I/II Study of Hyperimmune IVIG in Slowing Progression of Disease in HIV-Infected Children, To evaluate the safety tolerance pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of human anti-HIV immune serum globulin ( HIVIG ) at three dosage levels in HIV-infected children. Passive antibody therapy has been used with limited success in treating advanced HIV disease in adults. HIVIG is manufactured from HIV antibody-rich plasma taken from asymptomatic donors. It is hypothesized that HIVIG will decrease the viral burden of moderately advanced HIV-positive children.    ,NCT00000827
HIV,Study of Perinatal Transmission of Zidovudine-Resistant HIV Among Pregnant Women Treated With Zidovudine, To identify patterns of zidovudine ( AZT ) susceptibility among mother/infant pairs with perinatal HIV transmission. Most HIV-infected infants acquire their disease via perinatal transmission. Since transmission of HIV-resistant strains to infants could alter the course of disease and response to currently recommended treatment a study to assess the patterns of AZT susceptibility among mother/infant pairs with perinatal transmission is essential to delineate future therapeutic strategies.    ,NCT00000828
HIV,A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial of the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Seven Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Presumed HIV-Infected Infants, To assess whether HIV-infected infants who receive a heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine have more local reactions at the site of injection and systemic reactions than placebo subjects. To assess whether this vaccine is more immunogenic than placebo following the third vaccination. Children with HIV infection are at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal infection particularly bacteremia. A large proportion of pneumococcal disease is caused by a limited number of serotypes. The maximum number of pneumococcal serotypes that can be included in a new conjugate vaccine is felt to be limited by the amount of carrier protein. A heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been developed that consists of pneumococcal capsular saccharides from serotypes 4 6B 9V 14 18C 19F and 23F bound to a diphtheria toxin mutant carrier protein.    ,NCT00000829

HIV,Virologic Responses To New Nucleoside Regimens After Prolonged ZDV or ddI Monotherapy, To elucidate the relationship between virologic risk factors and immunologic and clinical progression in patients receiving monotherapy in protocol ACTG 175 and to compare new treatment regimens with combinations of reverse transcriptase inhibitors in long-term recipients of monotherapy. Specifically to determine in patients who have been taking zidovudine (AZT) alone for a long time whether it is beneficial to add lamivudine (3TC) to AZT or to switch to d4T alone and also to determine in patients who have been taking didanosine (ddI) alone for a long time whether it is beneficial to add AZT or AZT/3TC to ddI. Characteristics of virus replication pathogenicity and resistance are thought to determine the durability of virologic and clinical response to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Previous results of ACTG 175 suggest that either a switch to ddI or addition of ddI in patients receiving AZT results in better clinical virologic and CD4 cell response compared to continuation of AZT alone.    ,NCT00000831
HIV,A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Double-Blinded Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Recombinant Envelope Protein HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 (BIOCINE) Combined With MF59 in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Volunteers, To determine the safety and immunogenicity of rgp120/HIV-1SF2 combined with MF59 adjuvant emulsion versus MF59 alone in HIV-negative volunteers. One approach to improve the immunogenicity of an HIV-1 subunit protein vaccine is to combine the immunogen with an adjuvant.    ,NCT00000832
HIV,A Phase I Study of Combination Therapy With Didanosine (ddI) and Ribavirin in HIV-Infected Children., To compare the safety toxicity and tolerance of two doses of ribavirin in combination with didanosine (ddI) to HIV-infected children. To determine the toxicity of ddI/ribavirin and compare it to the expected toxicity of ddI monotherapy. To determine the effect of concurrent ribavirin on the pharmacokinetics of ddI. To determine a dosage of ribavirin that would be suitable for a Phase II/III evaluation of ddI/ribavirin. Ribavirin a broad spectrum antiviral agent may enhance the antiretroviral activity of didanosine ( ddI ) without a concomitant increase in toxicity. Ribavirin alters the intracellular metabolism of ddI enhancing the antiretroviral activity of the active form of ddI.    ,NCT00000833
HIV,A Phase I Study of Methotrexate for HIV Infection, To determine the safety and tolerance of methotrexate in HIV-infected patients. To determine the dose effective in modulating key markers of immune activation. To determine a dose suitable for Phase II or III evaluation in HIV-infected patients. In HIV infection complete immunological clearance of the foreign antigen does not occur resulting in chronic immune activation. Because chronic immune activation may contribute to disease progression in HIV infection immunomodulators may have therapeutic value in early HIV disease prior to development of opportunistic infections. The clinical benefits of methotrexate appear to derive from an anti-inflammatory effect; thus it may reduce the state of chronic immune activation.    ,NCT00000834
HIV,A Multicenter Randomized Placebo-Controlled Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of an HIV-1 Pseudovirion Vaccine, The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV-1 pseudovirion vaccine given at one antigen dose alone and in combination with each of two different adjuvants using two immunization schedules. The pseudovirions are virus-like particles generated by in vitro production of HIV-1 viral proteins which are capable of assembly into particles. The presence of gag gene products in addition to envelope glycoprotein should assist in humoral and cellular immunologic responses to internal HIV-1 viral proteins. The pseudovirion vaccine has been tested in preclinical trials in mice guinea pigs rabbits and nonhuman primates with good safety and immunogenicity profile.    ,NCT00000835
HIV,A Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of a Chickenpox Vaccine in HIV-Infected Children, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give Varivax to HIV-positive children and whether it protects children from infection. Varivax is a vaccine against varicella zoster virus (VZV) the virus that causes chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (zoster). VZV can cause many serious complications in HIV-infected children. Varivax is a VZV vaccine that has been approved for use in healthy children. More research is needed to find out how this vaccine will affect HIV-infected children.    ,NCT00000837
HIV,Antiviral Activity of and Resistance to Lamivudine in Combination With Zidovudine Stavudine or Didanosine, To evaluate the efficacy safety and pharmacokinetics of lamivudine (3TC) combined with zidovudine (AZT) stavudine (d4T) or didanosine (ddI) in comparison with d4T or ddI monotherapy in HIV-infected patients with no prior nucleoside therapy. 3TC may be uniquely effective in combination with AZT due to the interaction of AZT and 3TC resistance mutations. One explanation is that the M184V mutation which confers resistance to 3TC suppresses AZT resistance. This benefit of 3TC may not extend to combination therapy with other nucleoside analogs.    ,NCT00000838
HIV,A Phase I Trial to Evaluate Didanosine (ddI) in HIV-Infected Pregnant Women, To assess the pharmacokinetics safety and toxicity of intravenous and oral didanosine (ddI) administration in third trimester pregnant women who are HIV positive but are either intolerant or resistant to zidovudine (AZT). To collect data on infant toxicity following maternal treatment with ddI during the third trimester of pregnancy. AZT may not be the optimal antiretroviral agent for all pregnant women requiring therapy for HIV infection. Although ddI has been approved for use in HIV-infected adults and older children the safety and pharmacokinetics of ddI in pregnant women has not yet been determined.    ,NCT00000839
HIV,A Multicenter Exploratory Study to Evaluate the Effects of Antiretroviral Cessation on Plasma Associated HIV-1 RNA, To evaluate viral load in the blood stream of HIV-infected patients during a 28-day washout following cessation of long-term zidovudine ( AZT ) therapy. Because viral load (amount of HIV RNA in the plasma) is often used as a measure of the effectiveness of new antiretroviral drugs in clinical trials a washout period or cessation of current antiretroviral regimens is commonly required for study entry to allow for a drug-free steady state of viral load prior to initiation of the new drug. However the kinetics of the viral rebound following drug withdrawal has not been sufficiently studied and the proper duration of washout is an estimate.    ,NCT00000840
HIV,A Study of Indinavir Sulfate Plus Zidovudine (AZT) Plus Lamivudine in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Taken AZT for Six or More Months, To determine the clinical efficacy of indinavir sulfate or placebo in combination with zidovudine ( AZT ) and lamivudine ( 3TC ) in AIDS patients. Protease inhibitors such as indinavir sulfate may be effective in patients with advanced HIV disease who have received prior AZT therapy. Since studies suggest that triple drug therapy may have an advantage over both monotherapy and two drug therapy the combination of indinavir sulfate with AZT and 3TC should be evaluated.    ,NCT00000841
HIV,A Phase II Double-Blind Trial of Recombinant Human Nerve Growth Factor for Treatment of HIV-Associated Sensory Neuropathy, To assess the efficacy safety and tolerability of recombinant human nerve growth factor ( rhNGF ) in the treatment of HIV-associated sensory neuropathy. AS PER AMENDMENT 5/6/97: To compare the change in viral load between the double-blind phase baseline and week 4 in placebo and active rhNGF recipients. To ensure that rhNGF does not induce an increase in viral load compared with viral load changes seen with placebo. Up to now treatments for HIV-associated sensory neuropathy have been symptomatic relying on pain-modifying agents or membrane-stabilizing drugs. Because nerve growth factor is important in the development and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons and their outgrowths it is proposed that recombinant human nerve growth factor may provide a specific restorative treatment for HIV-associated painful sensory neuropathy.    ,NCT00000842
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of Adefovir Dipivoxil in HIV-Infected Children, To evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetic profile and acute toxicity of bis-POM PMEA ( adefovir dipivoxil ) in HIV-1 infected children and to determine whether age-related differences exist. To ascertain dosages that may be suitable for a multiple-dose evaluation in this patient population. Although the oral bioavailability of PMEA ( adefovir ) is low the prodrug bis-POM PMEA has resulted in increased bioavailability in adult patients in clinical trials. However the safety and pharmacokinetic patterns of drugs in infants often differ from those of adults and the direction of the variation is not predictable. This study will assess these parameters of bis-POM PMEA in children.    ,NCT00000843
HIV,A Multicenter Prospective Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial of Three Preparations of Low-Dose Oral Alpha Interferon in HIV-Infected Patients With CD4+ Counts >= 50 and <= 350 Cells/mm3, To evaluate the effects of three preparations of low-dose oral interferon alpha (i.e. Alferon LDO Veldona and Ferimmune) on HIV symptoms in HIV-infected patients. To evaluate differences in response to oral interferon alpha according to gender race/ethnicity and use of antiretrovirals. Previous or ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of low-dose oral interferon alpha have produced different results and it is not clear whether the differences were due to the interferon alpha products used or to problems in the study design. Therefore three preparations will be compared to evaluate their potential efficacies.    ,NCT00000844
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of UBI HIV Lipopeptide Vaccine Component P3C541b in HIV-1 Seronegative Human Subjects, To evaluate an HIV synthetic lipopeptide candidate vaccine component P3C541b at two dose levels administered subcutaneously (s.c.) in a randomized double-blind placebo controlled study.    ,NCT00000845
HIV,A Phase I Trial To Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of the UBI HIV-1MN PND Peptide Immunogen Given by IM Injection in Combination With the UBI Microparticulate Monovalent HIV-1 MN Branched Peptide Given Orally in HIV-1 Uninfected Volunteers., To evaluate safety and immunogenicity of 2 different HIV-1 peptide candidate vaccines the UBI HIV-1 MN PND peptide immunogen and the UBI microparticulate monovalent HIV-1 MN branched peptide when administered sequentially by 2 different routes of immunization parental priming followed by oral boosting.    ,NCT00000846
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Live Recombinant Canarypox ALVAC-HIV (vCP205) and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Volunteers, To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of high-titered ALVAC-HIV MN120TMG (vCP205) given sequentially or simultaneously with rgp120/HIV-1SF2 in MF59 adjuvant emulsion in HIV-negative volunteers. ALVAC-HIV vCP205 is a second-generation candidate vaccine that can be used to induce a humoral and cellular response against several antigens. vCP205 expresses proteins from two strains of HIV (MN and LAI). rgp120/HIV-1SF2 expresses proteins from a different strain of HIV. This study will help to show how the immune system responds to proteins from more than one strain of virus.    ,NCT00000847
HIV,The Anti-HIV Effects of Saquinavir Soft Gelatin Capsules Versus Indinavir in Patients Who Have Used Saquinavir Hard Gelatin Capsules for One Year, To determine in HIV-infected patients whether switching to a new soft gelatin capsule formulation of saquinavir or to indinavir following prolonged use of the original hard capsule formulation of saquinavir results in an acute decrease in plasma HIV RNA. Resistance to anti-HIV agents occurs with increasing duration of use. In vitro studies have shown that cross-resistance occurs among protease inhibitors although no clinical trials have been conducted to examine antiretroviral activity with sequential use of protease inhibitors or to determine whether saquinavir resistance can be overcome with higher concentrations of the drug.    ,NCT00000848
HIV,A Study to Test the Safety of Recombinant Interleukin-2 (rIL-2) in HIV-Infected Children, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (the highest dose that can be given safely) of recombinant Interleukin-2 (rIL-2) in HIV-infected children. This study also evaluates the effect of rIL-2 on the immune system of these patients. IL-2 is a substance naturally produced by the body's white blood cells that plays an important role in helping the body fight infection. HIV-infected patients do not produce enough IL-2 and it is hoped that the use of rIL-2 may improve immune system function in these patients. First it is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of this drug in HIV-infected children.    ,NCT00000849
HIV,The Effectiveness of GM-CSF in HIV-Positive Patients Who Are Also Receiving Anti-HIV Therapy, The purpose of this study is to see how HIV-positive patients who are taking anti-HIV drugs and have a viral load (level of HIV in the blood) of 1500 copies/ml or more respond to GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). GM-CSF is a medication that is being tested in HIV-positive patients to see if it can improve their immune systems or if it can lower the level of HIV in their blood. GM-CSF is often given to patients with leukemia or patients who have received bone marrow transplants to increase their white blood cells and to improve their immune systems. Doctors believe that GM-CSF can increase CD4 counts in HIV-positive patients but this study will also look at how GM-CSF affects viral load.    ,NCT00000850
HIV,Comparison of Stavudine Used Alone or in Combination With Didanosine in HIV-Infected Children, To evaluate the safety and determine the pharmacokinetic disposition of stavudine (d4T) alone and in combination with didanosine (ddI) and whether concurrent administration alters the disposition of either drug. To compare d4T versus d4T plus ddI with respect to short and long term changes from baseline in plasma HIV RNA concentrations. To determine the relationship if any between drug exposure and viral burden. In a pilot study of d4T and ddI given to eight children with advanced HIV for 24 weeks the three children with baseline counts greater than 50 cells/micro liter experienced a 20% increase in their CD4+ lymphocyte counts. Based on these results controlled trials of the same regimen for children with less advanced HIV disease should be undertaken.    ,NCT00000851
HIV,A Pilot Study of Allogeneic Lymphocyte Transfer in HIV Infection, To examine in HIV-infected patients the safety of allogeneic lymphocyte transfer (i.e. infusion of white blood cells taken from an HIV-negative parent sibling or adult offspring who has a compatible blood type). To measure the distribution and survival of allogeneic lymphocytes in the circulation of HIV-infected patients and to determine whether their infusion results in enhanced immunity. To determine whether enhanced immunity is passively transferred or actively induced. There is evidence that periodic infusion of allogeneic lymphocytes obtained from the peripheral blood of HLA-matched HIV-1 seronegative siblings of patients with AIDS can in some instances restore the number of circulating CD4+ lymphocytes. However more controlled studies are needed to better quantitate the immunologic reconstitution seen with this type of therapy.    ,NCT00000852
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled HIV-1 Vaccine Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Low Dose MN rsgp120/HIV-1 (Genentech) in Combination With QS21 Adjuvant or Alum in Healthy Adults, To expand the safety information regarding MN rsgp 120/HIV-1 formulated with QS21 or alum. To evaluate the immunogenicity of low doses of MN rsgp 120/HIV-1 formulated with QS21 or alum. Studies to date indicate that there may be a dose-sparing effect with the use of QS21. In animal studies when QS21 has been employed as an adjuvant it shifted both the dose response curve and allowed less antigen to elicit equivalent binding antibody titers to the rgp120 protein. There may also be an acceleration in the course of antibody response after both the first and the second immunizations. Although the final titers in response to vaccine given in both alum and QS21 appear similar after 3 doses in humans this plateau may be reached more readily and with a lower antigen dose when using QS21 as an adjuvant. In addition it has been established that using a lower dose of antigen may elicit an immune response which is characterized by lymphoproliferation and production of TH1-like cytokines such as INF-gamma interleukin-2 interleukin-4 interleukin-5 and interleukin-10.    ,NCT00000853
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Nandrolone Decanoate in Women With HIV-Associated Weight Loss, The purpose of this study is to see if giving nandrolone decanoate (a hormonal drug) will cause weight gain in HIV-positive women who have HIV-associated weight loss (wasting). Wasting has become an AIDS-defining condition. In the past most studies that examined wasting treatments were limited to men. However it appears that wasting in HIV-positive men is linked to levels of testosterone (a hormone which affects men's bodies more than women's). This study has been designed for women only in order to best treat wasting in HIV-positive women.    ,NCT00000854
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Zidovudine (ZDV) in Premature Infants Born to HIV-Positive Women., The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and tolerability of ZDV when given to premature infants born to HIV-positive women to prevent HIV infection. ZDV has been used successfully to prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy and birth. However ZDV has been given to very few premature babies and the best dose to use has not yet been determined.    ,NCT00000855
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Interleukin-12 (rhIL-12) in HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Cell Counts Less Than 50 Cells/mm3 or 300-500 Cells/mm3, The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerance and effectiveness of rhIL-12 in HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell counts less than 50 cells/mm3 versus 300-500 cells/mm3. This study will look at the ability of rhIL-12 to boost the immune system against HIV and HIV-associated bacterial infections in these patients. IL-12 is found naturally in the body and rhIL-12 is the commercially produced version. IL-12 may enhance anti-HIV immune system activity by increasing the number of cells that fight infection. IL-12 may also increase the body's ability to fight bacterial infections such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC).    ,NCT00000857
HIV,Detection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) in Vaginocervical Secretions: Correlation With Clinical Status Virologic and Immunologic Parameters and the Presence of Other Infections, To correlate HIV-1 viral load in vaginocervical secretions (VCS) as measured by culture and nucleic acid detection with that found in peripheral blood and HIV clinical status. To determine whether systemic and local HIV specific antibody influences the quality and type of virus isolated from VCS. To ascertain whether the presence of specific infectious agents (e.g. HPV HSV CMV etc.) influences the amount and type of virus isolated from VCS. Predictors for the development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in HIV infected individuals have been studied primarily among adult males and in selected small populations. Although many of these predictors may be relevant to women HIV infection does manifest itself differently between the sexes. Therefore it is important to study the spectrum of HIV disease in women and to identify unique and common markers cofactors and predictors of disease progression.    ,NCT00000858
HIV,A Randomized Trial of the Efficacy and Safety of a Strategy of Starting With Nelfinavir Versus Ritonavir Added to Background Antiretroviral (AR) Nucleoside Therapy in HIV-Infected Individuals With CD4+ Cell Counts Less Than or Equal to 200/mm3, To compare nelfinavir (NFV) with ritonavir (RTV) for delaying disease progression or death in HIV-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts less than 100 cells/mm3 [AS PER AMENDMENT 3/11/98: less than or equal to 200 cells/mm3]. To compare NFV with RTV for the development of adverse events and for rates of permanent discontinuation of study medication. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/02/97: To compare by intention-to-treat analysis for disease progression including death the following two regimens: NFV plus background combination antiretroviral (AR) therapy followed by indinavir (IDV) or RTV in the event of significant intolerance; and RTV plus AR therapy followed by IDV then NFV in the event of significant intolerance.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 3/11/98: SUBSTUDY CPCRA 045: To determine the relative rates of emergence of HIV-1 resistance and to compare changes in plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ cell counts in a sample of patients with CD4+ cell counts <= 200/mm3 who are enrolled in protocol CPCRA 042.] AR therapy is rapidly becoming the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection. AR therapy provides the best opportunity for maximizing viral suppression reducing toxicity and delaying the emergence of resistant strains. The newest class of AR agents the HIV protease inhibitors exhibits the most potent anti-HIV effects described to date. This study will compare 2 protease inhibitors NFV and RTV for efficacy and safety in a population with advanced HIV disease who are taking various background nucleoside therapies.    ,NCT00000859
HIV,The Addition of Indinavir to Anti-HIV Treatment in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of immediate versus deferred indinavir (IDV) in addition to background therapy on disease progression or death in patients with CD4+ cell counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3 and plasma HIV RNA levels >= 10000 copies/ml. This study aims to examine two management strategies immediate versus deferred IDV therapy for their clinical effects in the context of background antiretroviral (AR) therapy given according to current clinical practice. There is an urgent need to identify the optimal use of IDV in patient management since clinical endpoint studies have not been completed in the United States. Since there is little information about the long term durability of clinical effects and even less information about the timing of the initiation of protease inhibitor therapy exploring the disease progression and survival impact of immediate versus delayed use of IDV will yield important information to guide clinical decision making for this group of patients.    ,NCT00000861
HIV,A Study of Zidovudine During Labor and Delivery in HIV-Infected Pregnant Women, To obtain a pharmacokinetic profile of oral ZDV and to determine whether the oral administration of Zidovudine (ZDV) during labor and delivery will provide a similar profile to that obtained with the use of IV ZDV in ACTG 082. To evaluate the tolerance of oral ZDV in this population defined as the ability to take oral doses and lack of vomiting within 30 minutes of receiving oral study doses. The worldwide use of constant intrapartum ZDV infusions to prevent transmission is not practical or feasible. Approximately 18% of the women in the ACTG 076 trial missed their IV ZDV infusions even at experienced ACTG sites. There is an urgent need to establish a more practical method of delivering ZDV during labor and delivery that at minimum will approximate the rate of ZDV administration utilized in ACTG 082. In the future this would enable women to start an intensive ZDV regimen during early labor even prior to reaching the hospital.    ,NCT00000862
HIV,A Study to Test the Safety Tolerance and Metabolism of Abacavir (1592U89 ABC) With Standard Zidovudine (ZDV) Therapy in Newborn Infants Born to HIV-1 Infected Women, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety tolerance and metabolism of single-dose and multiple-dose abacavir (ABC) in HIV-exposed infants receiving standard postnatal treatment with zidovudine (ZDV). This study also evaluates the correct dosages of ABC to be used in future studies. Early aggressive therapy may be the best chance to slow disease progression in infants who may have been infected with HIV by their mothers. Early HIV suppression may significantly reduce viral levels and allow for restoration of the immune system providing improved control over HIV infection. Therefore it is important that the safety and tolerance of ABC in combination with ZDV be examined as potential early therapy in newborn and young infants.    ,NCT00000864
HIV,The Safety and Effects of 1592U89 Used Alone or in Combination With Other Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-Infected Infants and Children, To assess the steady state pharmacokinetic features tolerance and safety of orally administered 1592U89 given alone or in combination with other antiretroviral medications in HIV infected infants and children. To establish doses of 1592U89 appropriate for future pediatric Phase II/III clinical trials. On the basis of the preclinical and clinical studies 1592U89 appears to be a promising agent for treatment of HIV infection in children either as an alternative to currently employed agents or in combination therapy regimens. A liquid formulation of the drug is available; thus concurrent development of 1592U89 for children and adults is possible.    ,NCT00000865
HIV,A Multicenter Randomized Placebo-Controlled Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of the Therion Recombinant Vaccinia-HIV-1 IIIB ENV/GAG/POL Vaccine (TCB-3B) and MN RGP 120/HIV-1 In Alum., To evaluate the safety of administering Therion Recombinant Vaccinia-HIV-1 IIIB env/gag/pol Vaccine (TBC-3B) vaccinations to vaccinia-naive individuals. To evaluate the immunogenicity of priming with TBC-3B by the scarification intradermal and subcutaneous routes followed by booster immunization of MN rgp120 HIV-1. To compare the immunogenicity of priming with TBC-3B in vaccinia-naive individuals to vaccinia-immune individuals. In prior trials evaluating alternative methods of vaccine administration scarification has been found to be an imprecise method of administration and allows only 1.0 - 2.5 microliters of immunogen to be given. Since it is not feasible to produce vaccine at concentrations higher than 10 to the 10th pfu/ml this method limits the maximum deliverable dose. Intradermal and subcutaneous injection routes allow larger volumes of vaccinia to be given i.e.: up to 200 microliters intradermally and up to 100 ml subcutaneously. In the present study the initial priming dose will be the same administered by all 3 methods; however the second priming dose administered at 2 months intradermally and subcutaneously will be 2 logs higher in order to achieve boosting of immune responses particularly to gag and pol components of TBC-3B.    ,NCT00000866
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of HIV-1 LAI gp120 (an HIV Vaccine) Given With or Without HIV-1 MN rgp120 (Another HIV Vaccine) to HIV-Negative Volunteers, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of giving healthy volunteers a new oral HIV vaccine which has been incorporated into a bacterial cell. This oral vaccine (HIV-1 LAI gp120) will be given with or without a different injected HIV vaccine (HIV-1 MN rgp120). Vaccines are preparations that are introduced into the body to try to prevent infection or create resistance to infection. This study examines a new oral vaccine to see if it can improve the immune system's ability to fight the HIV virus when given alone or with another injected vaccine.    ,NCT00000868
HIV,A Study of Nevirapine for the Prevention of HIV Transmission From Mothers to Their Babies, The purpose of this study is to see if giving the anti-HIV drug nevirapine (NVP) to HIV-positive pregnant women and their babies can help reduce the chance that a mother will give HIV to her baby during delivery. This study will also test the safety of the drug and see how well it is tolerated by the mother and her baby. Previous studies suggest that NVP is a promising medication for blocking HIV transmission from HIV-positive mothers to their babies.    ,NCT00000869
HIV,A Phase II Study of Intermittent Recombinant Human Interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) by Intravenous or Subcutaneous Administration in Subjects With HIV Infection on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) Compared to HAART Alone, To compare two different routes of intermittently administered rhIL-2 with a highly active antiretroviral regimen (HAART) to HAART alone. The comparison is based on the following: proportion of patients achieving at least 50-percent increase in CD4 counts above prerandomization baseline values after 1 year of rhIL-2 and the rate of change in CD4 counts. To compare the safety and tolerance of these regimens and their effect on quality of life. To assess the effects of rhIL-2 when combined with HAART on changes in immune cell phenotypes and function and on HIV viral load and the rate of antiviral drug resistance development. The poor responsiveness of late stage HIV-infected patients to rhIL-2 is thought to occur because of low T cell regenerative capacity and high viral burden. If means were available to effectively suppress virus replication the indigenous immune restorative responses of the host may be further stimulated and enhanced by rhIL-2. The use of protease inhibitors with nucleoside-analogue combination regimens appears to be most effective in controlling virus replication. High-dose intermittent rhIL-2 administered either intravenously or subcutaneously has been shown to be effective in inducing CD4 responses in a number of studies.    ,NCT00000870

HIV,A Pilot Study of the Short-Term Effects of Antiretroviral Management Based on Plasma Genotypic Antiretroviral Resistance Testing (GART) Compared With Antiretroviral Management Without Plasma GART," To determine the short-term virologic and immunologic effects of using plasma genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing (GART) results (interpreted by study virologists AS PER AMENDMENT 9/17/97) in the management of therapy for antiretroviral-experienced patients failing on one of the following regimens:   1. zidovudine (ZDV) + (lamivudine) 3TC + (indinavir) IDV   2. ZDV + 3TC + saquinavir (SQV)   3. ZDV + 3TC + ritonavir (RTV)   4. stavudine (d4T) + 3TC + IDV. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/26/97: To determine the short-term effects of using plasma GART in the management of antiretroviral-experienced patients failing on a triple drug regimen that includes a single protease inhibitor (indinavir [IDV] saquinavir [SQV] ritonavir [RTV] or nelfinavir [NFV]) and two licensed nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).] A growing body of evidence suggests that antiretroviral resistance is associated with an increased risk of disease progression and death. All commercially available antiretrovirals and many of those in development have been associated with resistance. Fortunately techniques are available to define HIV genotypic resistance in ""real time"" as compared to techniques that measure phenotypic resistance that is not practical in a clinical setting. Using genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing (GART) results along with other currently available markers may lead to improved treatment decisions compared with using currently available markers alone.

HIV,Controlled Clinical Trial of Antiviral Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) Infusion Following Combination Antiretroviral Drug Therapy for Asymptomatic HIV-1 Infection, To evaluate the safety of anti-HIV CTL therapy in early stage patients and to verify the safety when combined with antiviral therapy with zidovudine/lamivudine/indinavir and low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2). To compare the effects on plasma and cell-associated viral load following combination drug therapy with and without antiviral CTL in early-stage patients. To study in detail the immune effects of lowering viral burden with antiviral combination drugs with and without T cell infusion on antiviral CTL activity viral suppression and proliferation circulating T cell phenotype T cell apoptosis CD4 cell numbers DTH reaction and inflammatory cytokine levels. In an HIV-infected person there is an ongoing struggle between HIV replication and host immune control. In the past decade most therapeutic strategies have targeted the virus. This approach has been frustrated by viral mutation to evade drug sensitivity. Promising drugs have recently been approved and there are encouraging sustained results from combination antiviral chemotherapy. However even the most potent drug regimens do not seem to be curative may eventually lead to drug resistance and may not completely restore lost immune function. The addition of immune-based therapy to antiviral drugs may lead to better viral control.    ,NCT00000875
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of CD4-IgG2 in HIV-Positive Children, CD4-IgG2 is a special man-made protein that was built to block the entrance of HIV into CD4 cells (cells of the immune system that fight infection). The purpose of this study is to see if giving CD4-IgG2 to HIV-infected children is safe and effective. HIV attaches to CD4 cells and enters them. Inside HIV makes copies of itself that will help the virus invade the body. CD4 cells are killed or disabled during this process of HIV replication. Decreases in CD4 cells lead to a weakened immune system. When CD4 cell counts become very low the body is unable to defend itself and HIV infection develops into AIDS. The protein used in this study CD4-IgG2 may be able to attach to HIV and inactivate it so that it cannot enter CD4 cells. This is an early study to examine CD4-IgG2 as a possible treatment for HIV in children.    ,NCT00000876
HIV,Study of How Indinavir (an Anti-HIV Drug) and Rifabutin (a Drug Used to Treat MAC an HIV-Associated Disease) Interact in HIV-Positive and HIV-Negative Adults, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of giving indinavir and rifabutin at the same time (simultaneously) vs 4 hours apart (staggered) to HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults. It is important to determine which medications for HIV-associated diseases such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease can be given safely and effectively with anti-HIV drugs. Indinavir and rifabutin have been given simultaneously in the past with good results. This study seeks to examine if staggering the doses will make the 2 drugs more effective. HIV-negative volunteers are used in this study to examine the effect of rifabutin on indinavir and the effect of staggered rifabutin doses. The effect of rifabutin on the drug activity of indinavir is evaluated in HIV-positive patients.    ,NCT00000877
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerance of Stavudine (d4T) in Combination With Lamivudine (3TC) in HIV-Positive Pregnant Women and Their Infants, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of 2 anti-HIV drugs d4T and 3TC given in combination to HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants. Most HIV-positive pregnant women usually take the anti-HIV drug zidovudine (ZDV) to treat HIV and reduce the chances of giving HIV to their babies. It recently has been shown that a combination of drugs may be more effective than ZDV alone. This study tests the effectiveness of combinations of ZDV d4T and 3TC.    ,NCT00000878
HIV,A Study of the Effects of Giving Two Anti-HIV Vaccines to Babies of HIV-Positive Mothers, The purpose of this study is to see if giving the ALVAC vCP1452 anti-HIV vaccine alone or with another vaccine called AIDSVAX B/B to babies of HIV-positive mothers is safe. The study will also look at how these vaccines affect a baby's immune system. Most HIV-positive children get HIV from their mothers during pregnancy or birth. Treatment with anti-HIV drugs can reduce the baby's risk of getting HIV. Vaccines also may help prevent HIV infection. This study will look at whether the ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine and the AIDSVAX B/B vaccine can help the body fight off HIV infection. There is no chance of getting HIV infection from the vaccines. (This study has been changed. In earlier versions ALVAC vCP205 and AIDSVAX B/E were going to be used.)    ,NCT00000879
HIV,A Study to Test the Effect of Cyclosporine on the Immune System of Patients With Early HIV Disease, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of low doses of cyclosporine (CsA) in patients with early HIV infection and to evaluate its effect on the immune system. Activation of T cells (cells of the immune system) leads to HIV replication. Inhibition of immune activation is therefore a potentially important area of therapy for patients with early HIV infection. CsA is capable of decreasing T cell activation which in turn may decrease HIV replication.    ,NCT00000880
HIV,Virologic and Immunologic Activity of Continued Lamivudine (3TC) vs Delavirdine (DLV) in Combination With Indinavir (IDV) and Zidovudine (ZDV) or Stavudine (d4T) in 3TC-Experienced Subjects, To compare the proportion of patients in the 2 zidovudine (ZDV)-containing arms who have a plasma HIV RNA concentration below the limit of detection (defined as 500 copies/ml or less) at Weeks 20 and 24 [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/24/98: HIV RNA concentration below the limit of detection is now defined as 200 copies/ml or less]. To compare the safety and tolerability of the different treatment regimens. To compare the decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA and the change in CD4 count from baseline to the average of Weeks 20 and 24 [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/97: and to the average of Weeks 44 and 48; AS PER AMENDMENT 8/24/98: and the average of Weeks 88 and 96] in the 2 ZDV-containing arms. To study the emergence of resistance to ZDV lamivudine (3TC) stavudine (d4T) delavirdine (DLV) and indinavir (IDV) in treated patients. To correlate the antiviral and immunologic activity and emergence of drug resistance with pharmacologic parameters of study drugs. To delineate the pharmacokinetic interactions of IDV and DLV. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/97: To delineate the possible development of cellular resistance to nucleoside analogs and the consequences of switching nucleoside study drugs on intracellular phosphorylation.] To document rates and patterns of adherence over the course of the study from day of randomization through 48 weeks. [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/24/98: To define long-term durability of the virologic activity of the different treatment regimens as defined by the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels that remains below the limit of detection. To define long-term tolerability of the different treatment regimens.] Although a change in reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors is recommended when adding or changing protease inhibitors in a treatment regimen the choice of available RT inhibitors is often limited by prior exposure toxicity or pharmacologic interaction with the protease inhibitors. This study addresses the question of whether to continue 3TC or substitute the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) DLV when adding IDV to therapy for patients previously treated with ddI or d4T plus 3TC who have greater than 500 copies/ml of plasma HIV-1 RNA. Although the activity of DLV as monotherapy or in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is of limited duration due to rapid emergence of resistance it is possible that DLV will contribute significantly to the activity of 3-drug regimens that include a new RT inhibitor plus a protease inhibitor.    ,NCT00000882
HIV,A Randomized Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Live Recombinant Canarypox ALVAC-HIV vCP205 Delivered by Alternate Mucosal Routes in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Volunteers, To compare the safety of ALVAC-HIV vCP205 to that of ALVAC-RG vCP65 rabies glycoprotein delivered by a variety of mucosal routes. To evaluate the antibody humoral and cellular immune responses resulting from ALVAC-HIV vCP205. [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/3/98: To obtain safety data on AIDSVAX B/B boosting administered by the intramuscular and intranasal routes in the context of previous immunization via alternate mucosal routes or intramuscularly with a canarypox vector expressing HIV-1 antigens (vCP205). To obtain immunogenicity data on AIDSVAX B/B boosting.] One of the earliest observations in the HIV epidemic was the demonstration of HIV infection at mucosal surfaces of cells in the genital tract. These data suggest that priming of immune defenses of viral infected cells may be an important component in the strategy of developing an effective HIV vaccine. Direct immunization of relevant mucosal surfaces with a vectored vaccine may stimulate mucosal immunity. The ALVAC-HIV vCP205 immunogen is constructed from a live recombinant canarypox vector that has a good safety profile in volunteers and should allow mucosal induction of immunity.    ,NCT00000884
HIV,Treatment Success and Failure in HIV-Infected Subjects Receiving Indinavir in Combination With Nucleoside Analogs: A Rollover Study for ACTG 320, Group A: To compare the time to confirmed virologic failure (2 consecutive plasma HIV-RNA concentrations of 500 copies/ml or more) between the treatment arms: abacavir (ABC) or placebo in combination with zidovudine (ZDV) lamivudine (3TC) and indinavir (IDV). To evaluate the safety and tolerability of these treatment arms. [AS PER AMENDMENT 06/16/99: To compare the time to confirmed treatment failure permanent discontinuation of treatment or death between the treatment arms.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: Groups B C and D completed follow-up on March 4 1999. Therefore only information pertinent to Group A is applicable.] Group B: To compare the proportion of patients who achieve plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations below 500 copies/ml as assessed by the standard Roche Amplicor assay at Week 16 or to compare the absolute changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations at Week 16 across the treatment arms: ABC or approved nucleoside analogs and nelfinavir (NFV) or placebo in combination with efavirenz (EFV) and adefovir dipivoxil. To compare the safety and tolerability of these treatment arms. Group C: To monitor plasma HIV-1 RNA trajectory over time and determine the time to a confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration above 2000 copies/ml on 2 consecutive determinations for patients treated with ZDV or stavudine (d4T) plus 3TC and IDV. Group D: To evaluate plasma HIV-1 RNA responses at Weeks 16 and 48. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment arms: ABC EFV adefovir dipivoxil and NFV. This study explores new treatment options for ACTG 320 enrollees (and if needed a limited number of non-ACTG 320 volunteers) who have been receiving ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC and IDV and are currently exhibiting a range of virologic responses. By dividing the study into the corresponding nonsequential cohorts (Groups A B C D) different approaches to evaluating virologic success i.e. undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and virologic failure i.e. plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of 500 copies/ml or more [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: 200 copies/ml or more] are explored while maintaining long-term follow-up of ACTG 320 patients. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/27/01: Groups B C and D completed follow-up on March 4 1999. Therefore only information pertinent to Group A is applicable. This study will examine the question of whether intensification of therapy can prolong the virologic benefit in individuals whose plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations have been below the limits of assay detection on ZDV (or d4T) plus 3TC plus IDV.]    ,NCT00000885
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of HIV-1 gp120 C4-V3 Hybrid Polyvalent Peptide Immunogen Mixed in Mineral Oil Containing Mannose Mono-Oleate (IFA), To evaluate the safety of HIV-1 gp120 C4-V3 hybrid polyvalent peptide immunogen (C4-V3 peptides) formulated in mineral oil containing mannose mono-oleate (IFA) in HIV-1 uninfected volunteers. To evaluate the humoral and cellular immune responses to the C4-V3 peptides as measured by the induction of 1 or more of the following: neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 MN and RF cross-neutralizing antibodies to primary isolates of HIV-1 HIV-1 antigen-specific lymphoproliferation CD8+ and CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity specific for HIV-1 gp120 or V3 peptides corresponding to the vaccine strains of HIV-1 induction of HLA-B7 and HLA-A2 restricted CD8+CTLs and induction of HIV-specific DTH responses. The test immunogen (C4-V3 peptides) is constructed from 4 sequences of the HIV-1 V3 gp120 loop shared by approximately 80% of North American HIV-1 strains. Because of the critical role that this region plays in generating anti-HIV sequences it is hypothesized that the test immunogen (C4-V3 peptides) will be capable of inducing a broad range of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies in the majority of recipients.    ,NCT00000886
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerance of Nelfinavir (NFV) Given With Zidovudine (ZDV) and Lamivudine (3TC) in HIV-Positive Pregnant Women and Their Infants, The purpose of this study is to see if giving nelfinavir (NFV) plus zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC) to HIV-positive pregnant women and their babies is safe. This study will also look at how long these drugs stay in the blood. ZDV has been given to mothers in the past to reduce the chances of passing HIV on to their babies. However better treatments are needed to further reduce these chances and to better suit the treatment needs of mothers and their children. Taking a combination of anti-HIV drugs during pregnancy may be an answer.    ,NCT00000887
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Ritonavir Plus Lamivudine Plus Zidovudine in HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and Their Babies, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give ritonavir (RTV) plus lamivudine (3TC) plus zidovudine (ZDV) to HIV-infected pregnant women during pregnancy and to their babies after birth. Pregnant women who are HIV-positive are at risk of giving HIV to their babies during pregnancy or delivery. It is important to learn how to prevent HIV-positive pregnant women from giving HIV to their babies. RTV and ZDV have been shown to be safe and effective against HIV in adults. The combination of 3 anti-HIV drugs (RTV 3TC and ZDV) may help prevent HIV infection from mother to infant but studies are needed to determine whether they are safe and effective during pregnancy.    ,NCT00000888
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Giving Interleukin-2 (IL-2) Plus Anti-HIV Therapy to HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Cell Counts of at Least 350 Cells/mm3, To demonstrate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneously administered interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus antiretrovirals in patients with HIV infection and CD4 counts of 350 cells/mm3 or more. To demonstrate the immunological efficacy of subcutaneous IL-2 therapy plus antiretroviral therapy relative to antiretroviral therapy alone. IL-2 given through injection under the skin in combination with anti-HIV therapy can increase CD4 cell counts. This study examines 3 doses of IL-2 in order to determine the safest and most effective dose to use.    ,NCT00000889
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Anti-HIV Therapy on Lean Tissue (Muscle) in HIV-Positive Patients, The purpose of this study is to determine whether HIV-positive patients with extremely low viral loads (level of HIV in the blood) have a greater gain in lean tissue during anti-HIV (antiretroviral) therapy than patients with higher viral loads. Many HIV-positive patients experience changes in body composition (muscle fat etc.) while on antiretroviral therapy. However any weight gained while taking antiretrovirals is mostly fat. A patient's viral load may affect whether weight gained is a result of increased fat or increased muscle. A large-scale study is needed to closely evaluate the effects of antiretroviral therapy on body composition.    ,NCT00000890
HIV,Immunologic and Virologic Consequences of Long-Term Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) in Subjects With Moderately Advanced HIV-1 Disease: A Follow-Up Study to ACTG 315, To evaluate the relationship between viral suppression and changes in immune function as measured by the restoration of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and lymphoproliferative (LP) responses observed after 48 weeks of treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in ACTG 315. To evaluate the durability of the antiviral and immunologic effects of long-term treatment with HAART. Given the extensive immunologic and virologic data available from ACTG 315 follow-up studies of this advanced-disease population are indicated to primarily ascertain the impact of long-term suppression of viral replication on immunologic reconstitution or re-education and the durability of the antiviral effects of HAART.    ,NCT00000891
HIV,A Study of Several Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Used Indinavir, To compare the proportion of patients whose plasma HIV-1 RNA is below 500 copies/ml after 16 weeks of treatment. To assess the safety toxicity and tolerance of each treatment arm. While indinavir is currently the most commonly prescribed protease inhibitor the optimal therapy for a person on an indinavir-containing regimen who experiences a rebound in viral load or never experiences a decrease in viral load below 500 copies per milliliter is unknown. Current clinical practice for such patients typically involves empiric use of a combination of other protease inhibitors (saquinavir/nelfinavir or saquinavir/ritonavir) and at least 1 other antiretroviral agent to which the patient has had little or no prior exposure. This may involve the use of 1 or more reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). This study attempts to formally evaluate some of these options in indinavir-experienced patients.    ,NCT00000892
HIV,Safety Tolerability and Anti-HIV Activity of DMP 266 (Efavirenz) in Combination With Nelfinavir in HIV-Positive Children, Cohort I: The purpose of this study is to see how safe it is to combine 2 anti-HIV medications efavirenz (EFZ) and nelfinavir (NFV) to treat HIV-positive children and to find an appropriate dose of EFZ to use in combination with NFV. Cohort II: The purpose of this study is to see how safe it is to give EFZ syrup combined with NFV and to measure the levels of EFZ and NFV in the blood. (This purpose reflects a change from the original since there are now 2 different cohorts of patients.) EFZ is an effective anti-HIV medication that easily can be combined with other drugs to treat HIV. This is an early study to determine a safe and effective dose for HIV-positive children. This study also will examine the correct dose of NFV to use in combination with EFZ.    ,NCT00000893
HIV,A Study to Compare the Effectiveness of a Four Drug Anti-HIV Regimen Given Alone or in Combination With GM-CSF or IL-12 to HIV-Positive Patients, The purpose of this study is to examine how the level of HIV is reduced in the blood when anti-HIV therapy is initiated. This study will also evaluate whether adding GM-CSF or IL-12 to the anti-HIV drug regimen will increase the rate that HIV is reduced. The anti-HIV drugs used in this study will include lamivudine (3TC) zidovudine (ZDV) indinavir (IDV) nevirapine (NVP) and stavudine (d4T). All have been used successfully to treat HIV. GM-CSF has been used to treat certain blood disorders; it will be used as an experimental drug in this study. IL-12 (interleukin-12) is a protein found naturally in the body that is thought to boost the immune system. Although GM-CSF and IL-12 have no direct effect against HIV these drugs may improve the ability of the immune system to fight the virus.    ,NCT00000896
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Different Methods of Birth Control on the Drug Actions of Zidovudine (an Anti-HIV Drug) in HIV-Positive Women and to Compare Zidovudine Metabolism in Men and Women, The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of different methods of birth control (oral and injectable) on how the body absorbs makes available and removes zidovudine (ZDV). This study will also evaluate the differences in men and women in how the body absorbs makes available and removes ZDV. Past research has shown that the effectiveness of ZDV as an anti-HIV drug might be decreased in individuals who use certain methods of birth control. ZDV may also have different effects in men compared to women.    ,NCT00000897
HIV,The Effects of Staggered Dosing on Interactions Between Paired Combinations of Nelfinavir Ritonavir and Saquinavir, The purpose of this study is to see if staggering doses of nelfinavir ritonavir and saquinavir has any effect on the interactions between these drugs.    ,NCT00000898
HIV,A Study on the Effect of Chemotherapy Combined With Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-Positive Patients, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of anti-HIV drugs combined with low-dose chemotherapy (consisting of cyclophosphamide [CTX]) in HIV-positive patients. This study examines whether this combination therapy can reduce the number of HIV-infected cells hidden in the lymph nodes and blood. Current anti-HIV drug treatments can greatly reduce the levels of HIV in the human body. However HIV can hide in certain immune cells and escape the drugs' effects. Chemotherapy using CTX destroys these immune cells. When used with standard anti-HIV drug treatments CTX may be able to speed up the elimination of HIV-infected cells.    ,NCT00000899
HIV,The Effects of Illnesses on HIV Levels in the Body, To describe the magnitude and duration of changes in HIV-1 RNA levels during and after an acute febrile illness. To identify factors associated with increases i.e. type of illness ultimately diagnosed (bacterial viral fungal) CD4 cell count and antiretroviral treatment regimen. To describe changes in phenotypic markers of immune activation/dysregulation of CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte subsets and their relationship to intercurrent illness. To describe changes in plasma cytokines and soluble activation markers and their relationship to plasma HIV-1 viremia during and after the onset of intercurrent illness. To characterize the viral biologic phenotype and the viral drug susceptibility genotype before during and after the onset of an acute febrile illness. To characterize the expression of HIV-1 co-receptors before during and after the onset of an acute febrile illness Repeated episodes of intercurrent infections have been postulated to be an important stimulus for progression of HIV infection. The study of intercurrent illness in patients with initially undetectable viral load removes viral load as a possible cause for virologic and immunologic changes and allows for a more direct association of the intercurrent illness with changes in viral load viral HIV-1 phenotypes viral HIV-1 genotypes and T cell phenotypes. Studying intercurrent illness and viral load provides an opportunity to characterize the potentially dynamic changes not only in viral load but also in phenotypic markers of T cell activation plasma cytokine levels phenotypic and genotypic changes in circulating virus and HIV-1 tropisms.    ,NCT00000900
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Giving Indinavir Plus Stavudine Plus Lamivudine to HIV-Infected Children, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give an anti-HIV drug combination of indinavir (IDV) plus stavudine (d4T) plus lamivudine (3TC) to HIV-infected children. IDV will be given either as a powder mixed into applesauce or as capsules given on an empty stomach.    ,NCT00000901
HIV,A Study on the Management of Combination Anti-HIV Drug Therapy in HIV-Positive Children With Prior Treatment, The purpose of this study is to determine the value of changing anti-HIV medications in children with progressive HIV disease who have received previous treatment. Plasma viral load (the level of HIV in the blood) is probably most effectively reduced by giving patients anti-HIV drugs which affect the virus at various stages of development. Changing the medications may enhance the results of treatment.    ,NCT00000902
HIV,Addition of Efavirenz or Nelfinavir to a Lamivudine/Zidovudine/Indinavir HIV Treatment Regimen, To compare time to a virologic failure (first of 2 consecutive plasma HIV RNA levels greater than or equal to 200 copies/ml at or after Week 24) of each 4-drug regimen vs the 3-drug regimen. To determine the safety tolerance and virologic benefits of either nelfinavir (NFV) or efavirenz (EFV) with indinavir/lamivudine/zidovudine (IDV/3TC/ZDV) vs IDV/3TC/ZDV alone in the treatment of patients with advanced HIV disease who have received limited or no prior antiretroviral therapy. Prior ACTG studies have shown that the 3-drug combination regimen (IDV/ZDV/3TC) resulted in improved clinical outcomes and therefore may prolong the effects of therapy. The enhanced effects seen with combination therapies are likely related to a greater suppression of RNA replication and alterations in resistance patterns. Due to the progressive success of combination regimens it is possible that more potent regimens will further enhance viral suppression and provide more durable treatment responses. In light of the additive suppression of HIV replication determined by pharmacological immunological and virological results nelfinavir (NFV) as an addition to IDV/ZDV/3TC will be evaluated. Based on the potency of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) to suppress viral replication and the effectiveness of 3-drug regimens containing NNRTIs efavirenz (EFV) will also be evaluated as an addition to IDV/ZDV/3TC.    ,NCT00000903
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Anti-HIV Vaccines in HIV-Negative Adults, The purpose of this study is to find out whether three different anti-HIV vaccines are safe and whether they help prevent HIV infection. These vaccines are called vCP205 vCP1433 and vCP1452. Some patients also receive another anti-HIV vaccine gp160. The vaccines are made up of small pieces of HIV which help the body learn to recognize and destroy HIV. You cannot get HIV from these vaccines. There are two different ways a vaccine can protect the body from infection. First a vaccine may help the immune system make antibodies which are proteins that recognize invading viruses or bacteria. Second a vaccine may help the body make immune cells that destroy infected cells. The second type of vaccine is more powerful against HIV. In this study doctors will see whether vCP205 vCP1433 vCP1452 and gp160 are good vaccines by seeing whether they help the body make immune cells.    ,NCT00000904
HIV,Interactions of HIV Protease Inhibitors and Methadone in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to combine methadone with two HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) ritonavir (RTV) and saquinavir (SQV) in HIV-infected patients not currently taking PIs. This study will measure the interactions between methadone and the PIs. Methadone is used treat addicts and to treat severe pain. In order to find the safest way to use methadone with PIs it is important to evaluate how they interact.    ,NCT00000906
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Giving IL-2 Alone to HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Cell Counts of at Least 350 Cells/mm3 Who Do Not Wish to Receive Anti-HIV Therapy, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of giving interleukin-2 (IL-2) alone to HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell counts greater than 350 cells/mm3 who do not wish to receive anti-HIV (antiretroviral) therapy. This study will also determine if IL-2 given alone can increase CD4 cell counts or decrease the level of HIV in the blood. IL-2 (a protein found in the blood that helps boost the immune system) can result in increases in CD4 cell count (immune system cells that fight infection). IL-2 is normally given in combination with antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV infection; however some HIV patients do not wish to take antiretrovirals. This study asks if it is safe and effective to take IL-2 alone to treat HIV infection.    ,NCT00000909
HIV,A Study to Collect Information About HIV-Positive Pregnant Women and Their Babies, The purpose of this study is to collect medical information about HIV-positive pregnant women and their babies who have been (or are being) seen at study sites. This information will be used to help design future research studies for these patients. The population of HIV-positive pregnant women and their babies who are seen at study sites has not been officially examined. In order to design future studies to research the best care for these patients this study will examine important characteristics and the general number of women in these trials.    ,NCT00000910
HIV,A Study to Monitor Patients With Primary or Early HIV Infection, The purpose of this study is to monitor patients who recently have been infected with HIV in order to learn how their immune systems respond to HIV infection and to study how the virus acts in their bodies. Primary HIV infection occurs within 20 days to 8 weeks following exposure to HIV. The symptoms of primary HIV infection are usually fever tiredness headache or muscle aches. However symptoms vary greatly from person to person and some people might not experience any symptoms at all. Because these symptoms also resemble the cold or the flu it is difficult to identify patients with primary HIV infection. Information gathered from this study will help doctors decide what kind of treatment is best to give patients who recently have been infected.    ,NCT00000911
HIV,A Study on Amprenavir in Combination With Other Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-Positive Patients, The purpose of this study is to compare 4 different combinations of anti-HIV drugs and to determine the number of people whose HIV blood levels decrease to 200 copies/ml or less while on the treatment. This study evaluates the safety of these drug combinations which include an experimental protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir. Despite the success that many patients have had with PI treatment regimens there is still a possibility that patients receiving PIs may continue to have high HIV blood levels. Because of this possibility alternative drug combinations containing PIs are being studied. It appears that amprenavir when taken with 3 or 4 other anti-HIV drugs may be effective in patients with prior PI treatment experience.    ,NCT00000912
HIV,A Study to Compare Two Anti-HIV Combination Therapies Each Containing Saquinavir in HIV-Positive Children, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of a soft-gel capsule formulation of saquinavir (SQV-SGC) a protease inhibitor when given in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. SQV-SGC has been tested in adults for the treatment of HIV infection but more information is still needed about SQV-SGC in children. Recent studies suggest that this soft-gel capsule form may be safer and more effective than other protease inhibitors.    ,NCT00000913
HIV,A Study of the Effectiveness of Different Anti-HIV Treatments in HIV-Positive Individuals Who Have Been on a Protease Inhibitor-Containing Drug Regimen for at Least 16 Weeks, The purpose of this study is to compare different treatments for HIV infection to see which works best to lower HIV levels and to raise the number of CD4 cells (cells of the immune system that fight infection) in HIV-positive individuals who have been on a protease inhibitor-containing drug regimen for at least 16 weeks. Researchers have found that combination anti-HIV therapy (multiple drugs given together) can help prevent AIDS-related illnesses and help people with AIDS live longer. In this study the anti-HIV drug efavirenz (EFV) will be tested with 1 or 2 other protease inhibitors (PIs) to see which combination works best to treat HIV infection. EFV has been shown to limit the amount of HIV virus produced by infected cells.    ,NCT00000914
HIV,An HIV Vaccine Preparedness Study, The purpose of this study is to estimate the rate at which a certain population becomes infected with HIV. The individuals examined in this study are people who are expected to take part in future studies of HIV vaccines and nonvaccine HIV prevention studies. This study also examines the chances of becoming HIV-positive based on certain risk factors under conditions that are similar to the conditions that would exist in HIV vaccine and non-HIV prevention studies. Before studying the effectiveness of a potential HIV vaccine it is important to learn about the range of HIV risk behaviors in the potential participants of these studies. The probability of HIV infection associated with these risk behaviors should also be examined. This study is designed to increase the ability of HIVNET to put into place HIV prevention trials to increase the diversity of trial participants and to target populations at highest risk for HIV infection.    ,NCT00000915
HIV,A Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of Hydroxyurea in Patients on Potent Antiretroviral Therapy and Who Have Less Than 200 Copies/ml of HIV RNA in Their Blood, This study compares the safety and effectiveness of continuing your current anti-HIV medications to that of adding or switching some of your anti-HIV medications. It will follow the effect of these medication changes including the addition of hydroxyurea (HU) on long-term viral suppression. Other medications which may be added include didanosine (ddI) and/or stavudine (d4T). Patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with indinavir (IDV) zidovudine (ZDV)(or d4T) and lamivudine (3TC) show viral suppression for two years or more. Discontinuation of one or two of these drugs results in prompt loss of the viral suppression. Other studies show that addition of HU to some reverse transcriptase inhibitor treatments results in increased antiviral effects. This study will provide further information on the effect of adding HU to a treatment regimen with respect to long-term viral suppression.    ,NCT00000916
HIV,Setting up a Blood Bank for Gene Therapy in HIV-Infected Infants, The purpose of this study is to set up a blood bank for infants who have HIV-positive mothers. This blood may be used in the future to treat the child if he/she turns out to be HIV-positive. Blood from the umbilical cord contains a certain kind of cell called a stem cell. Stem cells eventually turn into one of the many types of blood cells. If HIV infection can be prevented in these stem cells then when these stem cells are injected back into the infant the new cells that develop will also be protected from HIV. This study will provide the blood needed to test whether this type of gene therapy is safe and effective.    ,NCT00000917
HIV,A Study to Compare The Ability of Different Anti-HIV Drugs to Decrease Viral Load After Nelfinavir (an Anti-HIV Drug)Treatment Failure," The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of combining several anti-HIV drugs in order to decrease plasma viral load (level of HIV in the blood) in HIV-positive patients who have failed nelfinavir (NFV) treatment. In order to determine the ability of a drug regimen to decrease viral load after drug treatment has failed it is best to test a variety different of drug ""cocktails"" (drug regimens). The drug cocktails in this study include 2 new nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) efavirenz (an NNRTI non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) and either 1 or 2 protease inhibitors. It is important to include multiple drugs from different groups in a drug cocktail since combinations containing fewer drugs are likely to fail.    ",NCT00000918
HIV,A Study to Evaluate Various Combinations of Anti-HIV Medications to Treat Early HIV Infection," The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of various combinations of anti-HIV drugs in HIV-positive men and women. Patients receive specific combinations of 3 or 4 of the following 6 drugs: didanosine (ddI) stavudine (d4T) efavirenz (EFV) nelfinavir (NFV) lamivudine (3TC) or zidovudine (ZDV). Anti-HIV therapy is effective in preventing the spread of HIV in the body. However patients often experience unpleasant side effects and have difficulties following the dosing schedule. This study looks for combinations of anti-HIV drugs (""cocktails"") which will be the most effective with the fewest problems.    ",NCT00000919
HIV,Fortovase (Saquinavir) Given With Low-Dose Ritonavir Zidovudine and Lamivudine to HIV-Positive Pregnant Women During and After Pregnancy and to Their Newborns, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give saquinavir-SGC (SQV) combined with low-dose ritonavir (RTV) plus zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (3TC) to HIV-positive pregnant women and to see if it is safe to give 3TC and ZDV to their newborns. Another purpose is to see what levels of SQV low-dose RTV ZDV and 3TC are found in mothers and what levels of ZDV and 3TC are seen in newborns. Another purpose of this study is to see whether SQV passes from mother to newborn and if it passes at a level that is safe for the newborn. Although ZDV has been able to reduce the rate of transmission of HIV from mother to child it may be possible to reduce it further by using a combination of anti-HIV drugs. This study adds SQV (a protease inhibitor [PI]) with RTV (another PI) and 3TC (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) to the mother's ZDV regimen.    ,NCT00000920
HIV,The Effects of Prednisone on HIV Levels and the Immune System, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give prednisone to HIV-infected patients. Prednisone is a corticosteroid a hormone produced by the body that inhibits immune cell responses. Prednisone may be able to lower the level of HIV in the body (viral load) by reducing the number of cells that HIV can infect. At the same time prednisone may be able to increase CD4 cell counts (cells of the immune system that fight infection).    ,NCT00000921
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Effectiveness of Three Anti-HIV Drug Regimens in HIV Infected Patients Who Have Never Been Exposed to Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is better to start an anti-HIV regimen containing a protease inhibitor (PI) a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a PI in combination with an NNRTI. This study will also examine which treatment regimen is best as a first treatment for HIV infection.    ,NCT00000922
HIV,Treatment With Interleukin-2 (IL-2) Plus Combination Anti-HIV-Drug Therapy (HAART) for Patients Formerly in ACTG 328," This study examines the long-term effects of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in combination with anti-HIV drugs or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The purpose of this study is to see if IL-2 can increase the number of CD4 cells (cells of the immune system which fight infection) in HIV-infected patients who have completed ACTG 328. HAART is often successful in decreasing viral load (level of HIV in the blood) but these drugs have not been able to restore the immune systems of HIV-infected patients. IL-2 is a substance naturally produced by the body's immune cells. In ACTG 328 IL-2 is tested to see if it can increase the number of CD4 cells and ""boost"" a patient's immune system. This study is a follow-up to ACTG 328 so that patients who are benefiting from IL-2 can continue to take it and patients in the control group who do not receive IL-2 can start taking it.    ",NCT00000923
HIV,A Study to Compare Two Different Anti-HIV Drug Regimens, This study compares 2 different anti-HIV drug regimens to determine which is the most effective in lowering the amount of HIV in the blood. The anti-HIV drugs used in this study are 2 protease inhibitors (nelfinavir and ritonavir) 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (stavudine and didanosine) and 1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nevirapine). These drug combinations have been previously studied in adults but there is limited information on how well they work in HIV-infected children. It is important to develop drug combinations which are effective at suppressing the HIV virus in children.    ,NCT00000924
HIV,A Study to Evaluate High Protein Supplementation in HIV-Positive Patients With Stable Weight Loss, The purpose of this study is to determine whether a high-quality protein food supplement will help HIV-positive patients maintain and possibly gain muscle mass. Many HIV-positive patients lose weight that they are then unable to regain. This may be because patients are not eating enough protein or are not eating the right kinds of protein. The protein eaten in foods (such as meat eggs or beans) may not be able to make up for the amount of protein lost due to HIV infection. This study gives patients high-quality protein food supplements to help them maintain and/or gain weight.    ,NCT00000925
HIV,A Study of Nonoxynol-9 (N-9) and HIV Infection, The purpose of this study is to see if nonoxynol-9 (N-9) gel used in the vagina can prevent the spread of HIV. Most of the people with HIV in the world today live in southern Africa. Because this population is not likely to use condoms an HIV-prevention method that women can control is needed. N-9 used in the vagina may help prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.    ,NCT00000926
HIV,A Study of BufferGel in Women, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to use BufferGel in the vaginas of women who do not have HIV and who have a low risk of getting HIV. Many new cases of HIV are the result of heterosexual activity. Condom use is currently the only effective way of preventing the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). However women who have a greater risk of getting HIV are often unable to convince their partner to use a condom. Therefore it is important to develop methods that prevent the spread of HIV and that are controlled by the woman such as medicines used in the vagina. BufferGel is known to kill the organisms that cause STDs including HIV. BufferGel may do this without causing genital irritation and sores as other medicines do. More studies are needed to see if this is true.    ,NCT00000927
HIV,Phase I Trial of an Intervention to Increase Condom Use by HIV-Discordant Couples, To assess the acceptability of and participation in a group counseling intervention including an assessment of willingness to disclose serostatus to a regular sexual partner and the willingness of that partner to participate. To evaluate the profile of adverse experiences (social psychological and physical harms) of individuals resulting from participation in counseling and testing and attempts to initiate condom use within a stable HIV serodiscordant partnership. To assess the potential for the intervention to result in increased condom use among stable sexual partners. There is a significant risk of HIV transmission to HIV-uninfected partners in HIV-discordant couples. While condom use has been a major component of most AIDS prevention programs since the mid-1980s there has been little emphasis on promoting condom use within stable partnerships. The most effective way to promote condom use among discordant couples remains largely unknown.    ,NCT00000928
HIV,A Study of the Effects of Advantage 24 on the Rectum, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and acceptable for homosexual male couples where both partners have the same HIV status to use Advantage 24 during anal intercourse. Advantage 24 is a spermicide (a chemical that kills sperm). Much research and development is being done with chemicals that can be controlled by the receptive partner to prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Advantage 24 currently is used in the vagina as a form of birth control. The safety of Advantage 24 is particularly important for HIV-positive men because they have a greater chance of serious reaction to Advantage 24 due to other HIV-related conditions.    ,NCT00000929
HIV,A Study of HIV in Newly Infected Individuals, The purpose of this study is to see how HIV reacts in the immune systems of patients who have recently been infected with HIV. This study also examines HIV's resistance to anti-HIV drugs in newly infected patients. Certain populations are good candidates for participation in HIV vaccine trials. These groups include men who have sex with men IV drug users and women at risk of getting HIV through heterosexual contact. Learning how HIV behaves in these populations once they become infected can help with the planning of future HIV vaccine studies.    ,NCT00000930
HIV,HIV Prevention Counseling for Men Who Have Sex With Men, The purpose of this study is to see if a behavioral intervention a special kind of counseling can reduce the risk of HIV infection in men who have sex with men. The behavioral intervention will be compared to the standard risk reduction counseling that is given before and after getting an HIV test. In standard pre- and post-test counseling everyone is told the same things about how to prevent HIV. The behavioral intervention used in this study is designed to help each individual prevent HIV according to his specific problems and needs.    ,NCT00000931
HIV,A Study of the Long-Term Outcomes of HIV-Positive Patients, The purpose of this study is to collect information about life spans and HIV-related illnesses in multiple groups of HIV-positive patients with varying anti-HIV treatment experience including no treatment at all. Anti-HIV treatment has been successful in slowing disease progression in many patients. However there are still questions regarding the best way to use anti-HIV drugs. This study is designed to provide long-term monitoring of patients who have already received anti-HIV treatment as well as patients who are just beginning treatment or have decided not to receive treatment.    ,NCT00000932
HIV,A Study to Compare the Effectiveness of Different Anti-HIV Drug Regimens in Keeping Levels of HIV in the Blood as Low as Possible, This study will look at different anti-HIV drug regimens to see which works best to keep the level of HIV (viral load) in the blood as low as possible during maintenance therapy. You will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 3 groups: Group 1: Didanosine plus stavudine plus hydroxyurea (ddI/d4T/HU). Group 2: Didanosine plus stavudine plus efavirenz (ddI/d4T/EFV). Group 3: This group of patients will remain on their current drug regimens. This study will last approximately 3 years; you will receive study medications for the duration of the study. Anti-HIV drug regimens that include protease inhibitors (PIs) are very good at lowering viral load. However some patients have a rise in HIV levels while on PI maintenance. It may be possible to keep HIV levels low using another class of drugs for maintenance that are easier to take and less expensive than PIs. If viral load increases while a patient is taking this second group of drugs it may be possible to restart the PI drug regimen and again decrease HIV levels.    ,NCT00000939
HIV,Five-Drug Anti-HIV Treatment Followed by Treatment Interruption in Patients Who Have Recently Been Infected With HIV, This study will determine what effect taking a combination of five anti-HIV drugs during the early stage of HIV infection then temporarily stopping them once or twice may have on the amount of HIV virus in the blood (viral load). The study will also evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this anti-HIV drug combination.    ,NCT00000940
HIV,A Study on Possible Interactions Between Protease Inhibitors (Anti-HIV Drugs) and Drugs Which Lower the Level of Fat in Your Blood, The purpose of this study is to find out whether taking protease inhibitors (anti-HIV drugs) together with lipid-lowering drugs (drugs which lower the amount of fat in the blood) has an effect on the level of drugs found in the blood compared to when these drugs are taken separately. The three protease inhibitors given in this study are ritonavir saquinavir and nelfinavir. The lipid-lowering drugs given are pravastatin simvastatin and atorvastatin. Anti-HIV drug therapy using protease inhibitors has become very common treatment for HIV-positive patients. Recently however serious side effects involving how the body uses fat have been reported in people taking protease inhibitors. Examples of these side effects are redistribution of body fat and development of diabetes. People taking protease inhibitors have been found to have higher levels of fat in their blood than is normal which can cause heart problems. It is hoped that giving lipid-lowering drugs can help prevent serious heart problems. First however it is important to see what happens when protease inhibitors and lipid-lowering drugs are given together.    ,NCT00000941
HIV,A Study of Nevirapine to Prevent HIV Transmission From Mothers to Their Babies, The purpose of this study is to see if giving the anti-HIV drug nevirapine (NVP) to HIV-positive pregnant women and their babies can help reduce the chance that a mother will give HIV to her baby during delivery. Previous studies suggest that NVP is a promising medication for blocking HIV transmission from HIV-positive mothers to their babies.    ,NCT00000942
HIV,A Study to Test If Giving Remune (an HIV Vaccine) Can Improve the Immune Systems of HIV-Positive Patients Who Are Also Participating in ACTG 328, The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of an HIV vaccine (Remune) on the immune system. This study involves patients who have received at least 60 weeks of anti-HIV therapy either alone or in combination with IL-2 while enrolled in ACTG 328. Remune is an experimental HIV vaccine. To see how the body's immune system reacts this vaccine will be given with 1 to 3 other vaccines and skin tests will monitor the body's reaction.    ,NCT00000943
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerance of Combination Anti-HIV Drug Therapy (Indinavir Lamivudine and Zidovudine) in HIV-Positive Pregnant Women and Their Infants, The purpose of this study is to determine if a combination anti-HIV drug treatment regimen of indinavir plus lamivudine (3TC) plus zidovudine (ZDV) is effective in treating HIV and in reducing the chances of passing HIV from mother to child. This study will also examine if this combination is well tolerated by HIV-positive pregnant women and if a combination of 3TC plus ZDV is safe for newborns. Previous studies in adults and children have shown that indinavir plus 3TC plus ZDV can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood. Most HIV-positive pregnant women usually take ZDV to treat HIV and to reduce the chances of giving HIV to their babies. The combination of drugs in this study may be more effective than ZDV alone.    ,NCT00000944
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Use of Cidofovir (an Experimental Drug) for the Treatment of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) in AIDS Patients, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety tolerance and overall effectiveness of cidovir to treat PML in AIDS patients. PML is an opportunistic infection (HIV-associated due to weak immune system) caused by a virus that attacks the brain. Cidovir has been used effectively to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) of the eye. Cidovir could be an effective treatment for PML as well.    ,NCT00000945
HIV,A Study to Test the Safety of Three Experimental HIV Vaccines, The purpose of this study is to test three experimental HIV vaccines. This study will look at whether it is safe to give these vaccines together and how the immune system responds to the vaccines. There are a number of studies being performed to test HIV vaccines. The vaccines that seem to be the most promising are canarypox vaccines known as ALVAC vaccines. The three experimental HIV vaccines used in this study are called ALVAC-HIV vCP205 HIV-1 SF-2 p24 and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120. The HIV-1 SF-2 p24 and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 vaccines are mixed with an adjuvant which is a substance that increases immune response.    ,NCT00000946
HIV,Effects of Giving Interleukin-2 (IL-2) Plus Anti-HIV Therapy to HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Cell Counts of at Least 350 Cells/mm3, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of giving IL-2 plus anti-HIV (antiretroviral) therapy to HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell counts (cells of the immune system that fight infection) of at least 350 cells/mm3. This study will also examine the ability of antiretroviral therapy combined with IL-2 to boost the immune system. IL-2 given through injection under the skin in combination with anti-HIV therapy can increase CD4 cell counts. This study examines 3 doses of IL-2 in order to determine the safest and most effective dose to use.    ,NCT00000948
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Giving Proleukin (rIL-2) to HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Counts Greater Than 300 Cells/mm3, The purpose of this study is to examine how rIL-2 affects HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts over 300 cells/mm3 who are on anti-HIV drug therapy. The drug rIL-2 has been shown to increase CD4 cell counts which help the body fight off HIV. There is strong evidence that rIL-2 increases CD4 cell counts (cells of the immune system that fight infection). This study examines the effect of 2 different amounts of rIL-2 on CD4 cell count and the amount of HIV in the blood (viral burden).    ,NCT00000949
HIV,Metabolism of Antituberculosis Drugs in HIV-Infected Persons With Tuberculosis, The purpose of this study is to determine if a relationship exists between the level of antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid rifampin ethambutol and pyrazinamide) in the blood and the outcome of HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis. This study also evaluates how these drugs are absorbed and metabolized in the body.    ,NCT00000950
HIV,A Study of Ritonavir (an Anti-HIV Drug) in HIV-Positive Infants and Children, The study examines the safety and effectiveness of ritonavir (an anti-HIV drug) alone and in combination with other anti-HIV drugs in HIV-positive children under 2 years of age. This study will also determine the most effective doses of ritonavir for future pediatric HIV studies. Infants infected with HIV by their mothers experience faster disease progression than adults or older children. Treatment with anti-HIV drugs administered at an early age may slow disease progression in infant populations.    ,NCT00000952
HIV,Comparison of Brovavir Versus Acyclovir in the Treatment of Herpes in HIV-Infected Patients, To compare the efficacy of oral sorivudine (brovavir) and oral acyclovir for the treatment of localized herpes zoster in HIV-infected patients. HIV-infected patients are at high risk for herpesvirus infections including varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) infections also called shingles. Acyclovir an approved drug is widely used to treat VZV infections in the HIV population. Since no data from controlled studies are available to define the role of antiviral therapy for VZV infections in HIV-infected patients a study is needed to test the relative efficacy of brovavir an experimental antiviral drug versus that of acyclovir.    ,NCT00000953
HIV,Two-Stage Tuberculin (PPD) Skin Testing in Individuals With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection," To quantitate in an HIV-infected population the percentage of patients demonstrating the ""booster"" phenomenon (attainment of a positive response to a second tuberculin purified protein derivative skin test when the first skin test was negative); to determine the relationship between the booster phenomenon and CD4-positive lymphocyte cell counts; to detect any relationship between the booster phenomenon and HIV exposure category. The accuracy of skin testing to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) infection is dependent upon the host's ability to mount a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction; however the DTH response may be impaired or absent in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity a classic characteristic of HIV infection. Patients in whom immunity is diminished but not absent may test negative the first time a purified protein derivative skin test for MTb is administered but if the same skin test is repeated a positive DTH response may then be elicited. This occurrence is known as the ""booster"" phenomenon.    ",NCT00000955
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein gp160, To evaluate the safety and immune response to 640 and 1280 mcg HIV-1 recombinant envelope glycoprotein gp160. To evaluate the duration of antibody response and its relationship to dose and frequency of inoculation. Evaluation of previous patients who received doses of 40 or 80 mcg gp160 vaccine indicates that although serum anti-gp160 antibody responses were detected the level and duration of those responses were limited. A preliminary observation suggests that weak functional antibody responses may develop following the 18 month booster of 40 or 80 mcg; therefore a dose of gp160 vaccine having potentially greater immunogenicity is of particular interest.    ,NCT00000956
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccinia Derived HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein (gp160) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus: Evaluation of Accelerated Schedules, To evaluate the safety and immune response to vaccinia-derived HIV-1 recombinant envelope glycoprotein (gp160) using an accelerated dosage schedule; to evaluate duration of antibody response and its relationship to the dose and frequency of inoculation. Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS there is currently no cure for AIDS. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease depends on the development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.    ,NCT00000957
HIV,A Placebo-Controlled Phase I Pilot Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of ENV 2-3 a Yeast-Derived Recombinant Envelope Protein of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 in Combination With MTP-PE/MF59 in Individuals With HIV Infection (Placebo Patients Receive MF59 Emulsion Only), To determine the safety and immunogenicity of Env 2-3 in combination with MTP-PE/MF59 adjuvant in adult volunteers with HIV infection. By vaccinating those who have HIV infection perhaps the replication (reproduction) of existing viral strains can be suppressed and the asymptomatic period early in the infectious process can be prolonged. One potential way to do this is to boost HIV antigen-specific CD4 responses which may in turn increase the effectiveness of CD8 killing of HIV infected cells.    ,NCT00000958
HIV,Prophylaxis Against Tuberculosis (TB) in Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection and Suspected Latent Tuberculous Infection, To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a 6-month course of isoniazid ( INH ) in the prevention of clinical tuberculosis in anergic (having diminished or absent reactions to specific antigens) HIV-infected persons who are at high risk for tuberculous infection. A substantial number of HIV-infected persons are anergic and thus do not respond to the only currently available diagnostic tool for tuberculosis infection (that is the PPD (purified protein derivative) skin test). Many of these anergic persons are however infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and eventually develop reactivation tuberculosis causing both individual illness and spread of infection to others in the community. This study examines the possibility of using INH prophylaxis (that is for prevention) in anergic HIV-infected patients at high risk for tuberculosis as a means of decreasing the sharp rise in the incidence of tuberculosis due to HIV infection. INH is inexpensive and relatively safe and thus may demonstrate an acceptable risk/benefit ratio as a medication that can be given over a limited period of time to a population suspected of having but not proved to have M. tuberculosis infection. If this study shows INH to be safe and effective in this setting it could have a major effect on public health in this country.    ,NCT00000959
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of Zidovudine in HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and Their Infants, To determine whether the rate of HIV transmission from mother to infant can be reduced by continuous oral zidovudine (AZT) treatment to HIV infected pregnant women intravenous AZT during childbirth and oral AZT treatment of the newborn infant from birth to six weeks of age. The study is also designed to evaluate the safety of AZT for both the pregnant woman and the newborn infant. No method exists to prevent transmission of HIV from an infected mother to her newborn infant. Giving an antiviral agent (such as AZT) to the mother and to the newborn could in theory decrease the risk of infection to the newborn by reducing the exposure of the fetus to maternal virus or by preventive treatment of the fetus before exposure.    ,NCT00000960
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of Hyperimmune Anti-HIV Intravenous Immunoglobulin (HVIG) Plus Zidovudine in HIV-Infected Infants, To determine the safety and tolerance of hyperimmune anti-HIV intravenous immunoglobulin (HIVIG) and of zidovudine (AZT) in infants with established HIV infection; to get preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of this type of treatment in preventing the advance of disease in HIV infected infants. HIVIG may be an effective agent that either alone or in combination with AZT will prevent progression of clinical disease.    ,NCT00000961
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of BI-RG-587 in HIV-Infected Patients, To assess the safety and tolerance of multiple oral doses of Nevirapine (BI-RG-587). To generate data on the pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of Nevirapine with multiple dosing. To characterize the pattern of virological activity in vivo. Improvement in virological end points will be examined for association with dose and absorption. To determine whether development of resistance is reflected in return of virological activity and if so when markers reflect this resistance. To determine if improvements of immunological endpoints are detectable in the number of patients studied. A compound free of the toxic effects of nucleoside chain terminators such as zidovudine (AZT) may have an advantage over currently available treatments for HIV infection. Such a compound has further advantages if it is active against AZT-resistant isolates. Nevirapine (BI-RG-587) has shown in vitro inhibitory activity against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). The molecular mechanism of the RT inhibitory effect is hypothesized to be non-competitive inhibition due to its binding to an RT site distinct from those for the RNA template primer the deoxynucleotide triphosphate or the RNase H catalytic site.    ,NCT00000962
HIV,A Study of Dideoxyinosine (ddI) in HIV-Infected Children Who Have Not Had Success With Zidovudine or Who Cannot Take Zidovudine, To evaluate the effectiveness safety and tolerance of two doses of didanosine (ddI) in the treatment of children with symptomatic HIV disease who have had to discontinue zidovudine (AZT) because of intolerance and/or who have experienced progressive disease while on AZT. The progression of immunodeficiency due to HIV infection can be delayed by using AZT. The benefits of AZT in adults with AIDS and severe AIDS-related complex (ARC) appear to last for approximately 12 to 18 months at which time most patients have progressive deterioration. Recently published literature has described a reduced sensitivity of HIV isolated from patients after prolonged AZT treatment. Although the clinical significance of this is unclear it makes the development of new antiretroviral drugs important.    ,NCT00000963
HIV,The Effect of Stomach Acid on Foscarnet, To see if ranitidine by reducing stomach acidity can enhance the effectiveness of foscarnet by making foscarnet more available to the body. Foscarnet is an antiviral compound. Laboratory studies have shown it to be active against HIV. However only 12 - 22 percent of an oral foscarnet dose is absorbed by the body. Ranitidine suppresses gastric acid output increasing gastric pH. Thus by increasing gastric pH (decreasing stomach acidity) less foscarnet is expected to be decomposed or broken down in the stomach. Thus more foscarnet should be absorbed into the body.    ,NCT00000964
HIV,The Effects of Zidovudine on the Blood of HIV-Infected Patients, To define the pharmacokinetic parameters (blood levels) of total phosphorylated zidovudine (AZT) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV-infected patients. Despite an understanding of the serum (or plasma) pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of AZT a therapeutic concentration range and optimal dosing interval have not yet been determined.    ,NCT00000965
HIV,The Safety of Zidovudine Plus Interferon-Alpha in HIV-Infected Children, PRIMARY: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of interferon-alfa (IFN-A) alone and in combination with zidovudine (AZT); to assess the safety and tolerance of IFN-A alone and in combination with AZT. SECONDARY: To evaluate the effect of combination IFN-A and AZT on immunologic and virologic parameters; to determine whether the pharmacokinetic parameters of AZT are modified by the subcutaneous administration of IFN-A. AZT is effective in suppressing the progression of HIV infection in patients without symptoms or with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). However use of AZT is limited by its frequent toxicity which sometimes relates to the amount of drug given. Thus a combination treatment of two drugs that work together may provide more effective and safer treatment. IFN-A is a drug that has antiviral effects and may work well with AZT.    ,NCT00000967
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccinia-Derived HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein (gp160), To determine the safety of vaccinia-derived HIV-1 recombinant envelope glycoprotein (gp160) in human volunteers; to evaluate the immunogenicity of this preparation in human volunteers. Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS there is currently no cure for AIDS. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease depends on the development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.    ,NCT00000968
HIV,A Prospective Randomized Open-Label Comparative Trial of Dideoxyinosine (ddI) Versus Dideoxycytidine (ddC) in HIV-Infected Patients Who Are Intolerant of or Who Have Failed Zidovudine (AZT) Therapy, To evaluate and compare the effectiveness and toxicity associated with didanosine ( ddI ) and zalcitabine ( dideoxycytidine; ddC ) in patients with HIV infection who are intolerant of or have failed zidovudine ( AZT ) therapy. Alternative and less toxic treatments need to be investigated for the treatment of HIV infection. Studies have shown that the dideoxynucleosides ddI and ddC may be effective antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV-infected individuals. However ddI and ddC have yet to be compared on the basis of patient survival drug tolerance immunologic and virologic effectiveness and the incidence of opportunistic infection or opportunistic malignancy. Results of this study will yield information regarding the relative therapeutic benefits and toxicities of each drug while providing alternative treatment to patients who are unable to tolerate or have had progression of disease while on AZT.    ,NCT00000969
HIV,A Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate: Part A. The Safety of MTP-PE/MF59 Adjuvant Emulsion. Part B. The Safety and Immunogenicity of Env 2-3 a Yeast Derived Recombinant Envelope Protein of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 in Combination With MTP-PE/MF59," To evaluate the safety of a fixed antigen dose with an increasing dose of adjuvant (MTP-PE/MF59 a substance to enhance the immune response to vaccine) in volunteers. To evaluate local and systemic reactions (Part A). To determine the safety and immunogenicity of Env 2-3 in combination with MTP-PE/MF59 in volunteers (Part B). The vaccine Env 2-3 is created from one of the viral proteins that make up HIV called envelope glycoprotein gp120. A problem with many immunogens including candidate HIV vaccines is that they may evoke relatively weak immune responses particularly in humans and in nonhuman primates. Thus there is considerable interest in the development of ""adjuvants"" (substances that augment immune responses to vaccines). MTP-PE/MF59 is an adjuvant that appears to be particularly promising and is selected for the studies with this HIV vaccine candidate.    ",NCT00000972
HIV,A Study of Itraconazole in the Treatment and Prevention of Histoplasmosis a Fungal Infection in Patients With AIDS, To evaluate the feasibility of itraconazole as (1) primary therapy in histoplasmosis and (2) maintenance therapy after completion of primary therapy. To evaluate the effect of therapy of CNS histoplasmosis. To determine if resistance to drug occurs in patients who fail therapy. Histoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Although the clinical response to amphotericin B treatment in the AIDS patients is generally good administration difficulties and toxicity detract from its usefulness. Oral treatment with ketoconazole overcomes these limitations of amphotericin B but does not appear to be effective for primary treatment in patients with AIDS. Itraconazole is a triazole compound in which preclinical studies have demonstrated activity against Histoplasmosis capsulatum. Preclinical studies have also shown that itraconazole appears effective in the treatment of histoplasmosis. The frequency of adverse reactions to itraconazole has been low in several studies. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occurs in up to 20 percent of patients with histoplasmosis and appears to have a poor response to amphotericin B treatment. Itraconazole has been used successfully in a small number of patients with cryptococcal meningitis supporting a study of its use in CNS histoplasmosis.    ,NCT00000975
HIV,A Phase I Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Recombinant Human CD4-Immunoglobulin G (rCD4-IgG) Administered by Intravenous Bolus Injection in Combination With Oral Zidovudine in Patients With AIDS and AIDS-Related Complex, To determine the safety profile of recombinant human CD4-immunoglobulin G (CD4-IgG) and zidovudine (AZT) combination therapy in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC); to assess pharmacokinetic (blood level) properties of CD4-IgG in combination with AZT; and to obtain preliminary indication of the antiviral and immunologic effects of CD4-IgG in combination with AZT in patients with AIDS and ARC. Treatment of AIDS has been directed toward the underlying retroviral infection as well as toward specific opportunistic infections and malignancies that are associated with the syndrome. The most extensively studied drugs are reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as AZT and other nucleoside analogs including didanosine (ddI) and dideoxycytidine (ddC). The most extensive clinical experience has been achieved with AZT. These clinical trials indicated a decreased incidence of opportunistic infection and increased survival in patients with AIDS. However AZT treatment is associated with dose-limiting toxicities. Additionally identification of resistance to AZT has increased the need to test the effectiveness of AZT in combination with other drugs. CD4-IgG is capable of binding to HIV envelope protein (gp120) and inhibiting HIV infectivity in test tube studies. Potential therapeutic benefit in patients with HIV infection may be derived from CD4-IgG.    ,NCT00000976
HIV,Active Immunization of Asymptomatic HIV-Infected Individuals With Recombinant GP160 HIV-1 Antigen: A Phase I/II Study of Immunogenicity and Toxicity, To determine the minimal effective (immunogenic) dose of vaccine in asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositive individuals with > 400 cells/mm3 (CD4). To determine the dose-response to a 4 fold escalation of the immunizing dose. To describe both cellular and humoral immune responses to HIV-1 in the immunized individuals. To describe the effects of this immunization on general immunological virological and clinical parameters. To evaluate the safety of injecting recombinant gp160 in this population. To evaluate the extent of variability between different lots of gp160 (arms C1 and C2). It might be possible to increase immune responses or to induce new types of immune responses to HIV in some infected individuals by means of a vaccine which could result in an immunological virological or clinical benefit.    ,NCT00000977
HIV,A Study of Dideoxycytidine Plus Zidovudine in the Treatment of AIDS or Advanced AIDS Related Complex (ARC), To determine the safety tolerability and activity of zidovudine (AZT) and zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) and the bloodstream levels of these drugs in patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex (ARC). Treatments using AZT alternating with ddC are being evaluated in ongoing trials with a goal of reducing the toxicity of each while maintaining antiviral effects. In addition AZT and ddC may work together in a way that both drugs can be taken at lower doses or less frequent intervals when given together. If the doses can be reduced then toxicity associated with long-term use of one drug may be reduced. Combination of AZT and ddC might reduce the likelihood of the emergence of resistant mutants. Recent studies indicate a reduced sensitivity of HIV isolated from patients after prolonged AZT therapy. Although the clinical significance of this finding is not clear it would indicate that these combination studies are all the more important. HIV strains with decreased sensitivity to AZT are still sensitive to ddC.    ,NCT00000978
HIV,Comparison of ddI Versus Zidovudine in HIV-Infected Patients, To compare the effectiveness and toxicity of didanosine (ddI) and zidovudine (AZT) in patients with AIDS advanced AIDS-related complex (ARC) or asymptomatic infection with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3. AZT is effective in reducing mortality in patients with AIDS who receive the drug after the first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and in patients with advanced ARC. However AZT therapy has been associated with significant toxicities. In addition the effectiveness of AZT appears to decrease during the second and third years of therapy. For these reasons the development of alternative therapy that would be at least as effective but less toxic is of great importance. The drug ddI is an antiviral agent that inhibits replication (reproduction) of HIV with less apparent toxicity than AZT.    ,NCT00000979
HIV,The Safety of Different Dose Levels of Zidovudine in HIV-Infected Children, To evaluate and compare differences in tolerance and side effects associated with two different dosages of zidovudine (AZT) when used to treat children with HIV infection. Other goals are to evaluate and compare the degree of change in neurodevelopmental disease and determine whether there are differences in the rate and degree of toxicities associated with one versus the other dosage. AZT has been shown to decrease the death rate and frequency of opportunistic infections in certain adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection. Thus it is likely that symptomatic HIV infected children may also benefit from AZT. Studies of the safety and pharmacokinetics (blood levels) in children have indicated that AZT can be given to children in doses that can be tolerated and that can be assumed to be therapeutic. Those currently taking care of infected children no longer feel it is ethical to conduct an AZT/placebo (inactive substance) trial. In addition given the information learned from studies of adult patients that shows effectiveness of AZT at lower doses experience with an equivalent lower dose in children needs to be studied.    ,NCT00000983
HIV,A Phase I Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Recombinant CD4 (rCD4) in Infants and Children Infected With or at Risk for HIV Infection, AMENDED: As of 10/19/90 only Children 0 to 3 months are being enrolled. Original design: To determine whether the experimental drug recombinant CD4 (rCD4) which is produced through genetic engineering technology is safe and well-tolerated in children infected with or at risk for HIV infection. rCD4 may be an effective treatment for HIV infection based on its ability to block infection of human cells by HIV in laboratory tests. However the activity of rCD4 still needs to be confirmed in clinical trials. It is hoped that these tests will show that rCD4 is both safe and effective in treating children who are infected with or who are at risk for infection with HIV.    ,NCT00000984
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of Interleukin-2 Plus Zidovudine in Patients With AIDS or AIDS Related Complex, To test the safety and tolerance of three different doses of recombinant human interleukin 2 (aldesleukin; IL-2) when it is given for five consecutive days to patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) who have also received zidovudine (AZT) for at least 6 weeks just before beginning the IL-2 treatment. AZT is an antiviral drug which has been shown to be beneficial in some patients with AIDS. IL-2 is a substance found naturally in the body that boosts the body's immune response to invading organisms and tumor cells. These two drugs when administered together may have a mutually helpful effect in treating AIDS patients but before this effect can be studied it is important to understand the proper dose and any side effects that may occur when these drugs are used together. The study will show how much AZT and IL-2 patients can safely take at the same time and how the two drugs will interact with each other.    ,NCT00000986
HIV,A Study of BMY-27857 in Patients With AIDS or AIDS Related Complex, To evaluate the safety minimum effective dose (MED) pharmacokinetics and efficacy of orally administered 2'3'-dideoxy-2'3'-didehydrothymidine (d4T) in patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC). To establish an appropriate dosage regimen of d4T to be employed in Phase II and III trials. To evaluate the effects of de-escalating doses of d4T on markers associated with HIV infection. Currently the only FDA-approved therapy for patients with AIDS or ARC is zidovudine (AZT) a drug with significant value but limited use because of toxic effects on the bone marrow. d4T has not been tested in humans but it has inhibited the reproduction of HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) in laboratory experiments. In some studies with laboratory animals d4T was less toxic against blood cells than AZT.    ,NCT00000988
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of Zidovudine in the Treatment of HIV-Infected Children With Mild to Moderate Symptoms, To determine the safety and usefulness of zidovudine (AZT) for the treatment of children 3 months to 12 years of age. This study is designed to determine if children who are infected with HIV and who have a special type of lung disease called lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) or other early symptoms of HIV infection may derive benefit from treatment with AZT. It is hoped that this drug will prevent children from developing additional symptoms and infections and will help resolve already existing symptoms. AZT has been shown in the laboratory to inhibit the infection of cells by HIV. AZT has been shown to decrease the mortality and the frequency of opportunistic infections in certain adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection. It is therefore likely that symptomatic HIV-infected children may also benefit from specific antiviral therapy.    ,NCT00000990
HIV,A Study of Itraconazole in Preventing the Return of Histoplasmosis a Fungal Infection in Patients With AIDS, To test the effectiveness of itraconazole in preventing the recurrence of disseminated histoplasmosis in AIDS patients. Histoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Amphotericin B has been used to treat the infection. Although the response to this treatment is generally good up to 90 percent of AIDS patients who have taken amphotericin B to treat their histoplasmosis infection will have a relapse (that is they will get the disease again) within 12 months following treatment. Ketoconazole has been used to prevent relapse but available information suggests that up to 50 percent of AIDS patients relapse even with ketoconazole treatment. A more effective therapy to prevent recurrence is needed. Itraconazole has been used successfully to treat disseminated histoplasmosis in non-AIDS patients and it is hoped that it may be more effective in preventing histoplasmosis relapse.    ,NCT00000992
HIV,A Study of Zidovudine in the Prevention of HIV Infection in Individuals Exposed to the Virus, To prevent individuals who have had a massive accidental exposure to HIV from becoming infected with HIV and possibly developing AIDS by treating them with zidovudine (AZT). Although the number of persons who have been (or will be) exposed to a high concentration of HIV is quite small these persons have a high risk of becoming infected and treatments are needed to prevent infection after such an exposure. In animal studies AZT has prevented the development of infections after exposure of the animals to a retrovirus (the HIV is a retrovirus). In patients with AIDS AZT has been effective in delaying the progression of the disease. For these reasons a trial of AZT is indicated.    ,NCT00000993
HIV,A Study of AZT in HIV-Infected Patients With AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma, To determine whether taking zidovudine (AZT) will change the natural course of HIV infection in patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and whether administering AZT at a similar dose but at different intervals will reduce toxicity in a more manageable treatment plan. Patients infected with AIDS can benefit from therapy with an effective anti-AIDS virus agent. AZT is a drug that is effective in inhibiting the effects of HIV infection. The study will show whether toxicity of AZT can be reduced in a more manageable treatment plan and whether AZT therapy will delay the development of opportunistic infections and/or KS lesions.    ,NCT00000994
HIV,A Study of Dideoxycytidine in HIV-Infected Patients, To determine how much of a dose is absorbed by the body when zalcitabine ( dideoxycytidine; ddC ) is given orally and how long the drug stays in the body after absorption or intravenous (IV) administration. Laboratory tests have shown that ddC is effective in stopping the growth of the HIV in test tubes. The study will reveal the pharmacokinetic (blood levels) properties of this new drug and how long the drug remains in the body at each of six doses. This should be useful background information and should allow a simple and efficient comparative study of any new oral formulation such as a tablet or capsule since dose-related problems will already be known.    ,NCT00000997
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of Zidovudine (AZT) in the Treatment of HIV Infection in Patients With AIDS and Advanced ARC, To obtain information about the long-term safety and toxicity of zidovudine (AZT). To ascertain whether interruption/resumption at a lower dosage is the optimal management of AZT toxicity. Because of the high incidence of toxicity and the relatively short-term follow-up of the patients due to the early ending of the Phase II placebo-controlled experiment it is valuable to continue to get information on the long-term toxicity of AZT.    ,NCT00000999
HIV,A Study of Atvogen in Healthy Volunteers and HIV-Infected Patients Who Have No Symptoms of Infection, To evaluate the degree and sequence of immunologic enhancement and the cellular resistance to certain infections after a single dose of atvogen (ampligen). In addition the relationship between activation of immune cells and biochemical markers of that activation will be studied. Treatment of patients with HIV infection must address both the primary viral infection and the subsequent immune deficiency which is the primary cause of mortality in AIDS. In vitro studies of ampligen have shown it will inhibit HIV infection. Ampligen may also minimize the toxicity of many drugs used in the treatment of AIDS and induce an antiviral state in the brain that may be useful in treating neurologic symptoms of HIV infection. The time course and degree of immunologic response to ampligen remain unknown although they are essential for proper use of the drug in the treatment of HIV infection and perhaps other clinical problems.    ,NCT00001000
HIV,A Study of Zidovudine in HIV-Infected Patients With Liver Disease, To examine the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and bioavailability of zidovudine (AZT) given to patients with HIV infection and chronic liver disease. The specific aim of the study is to provide data permitting the development of guidelines for use of AZT in patients with mild moderate or severe liver disease. AZT is the only antiviral agent that has been shown to be effective in patients with severe HIV infection. However AZT is largely eliminated from the body through a biochemical reaction that takes place in the liver and it is possible that patients with underlying liver disease may have altered AZT pharmacokinetics and may metabolize AZT differently with the result that they are susceptible to an increased risk of serious drug toxicity. This study will examine the pharmacokinetics elimination and metabolism of AZT in patients with liver disease. Guidelines developed from the data will be helpful in managing AZT treatment of these HIV-infected persons and will indicate whether the dose of AZT administered should be adjusted to compensate for any changes in its bioavailability and/or pharmacokinetics.    ,NCT00001001
HIV,A Study of Foscarnet in the Treatment of HIV Infection in Patients Who Have Taken Zidovudine for a Long Time, To study the toxicity pharmacokinetics and antiretroviral effectiveness of combined oral zidovudine (AZT) and intermittent intravenous foscarnet therapy in stable AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) patients who have already received AZT for 8 - 52 weeks. It is hypothesized that the maximum AZT antiretroviral effect which occurs at 8 weeks of therapy will be enhanced by 2 weeks of foscarnet treatment given at the same time by intermittent intravenous infusion. In addition the further lowering of serum p24 antigen concentration that should occur during combined therapy might continue when oral AZT therapy is continued without foscarnet.    ,NCT00001002
HIV,A Study of Tumor Necrosis Factor and Human Interferon-gamma in Patients With AIDS Related Complex, To study the tolerance and toxicity of the combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon gamma (IFN-G) or as single agent TNF or IFN-G in HIV infected patients. To selectively monitor the immune system of AIDS related complex (ARC) patients who receive either combination therapy or TNF or IFN-G alone. To obtain information on the effectiveness of combination therapy or TNF or IFN-G alone against HIV in ARC patients. Recombinant TNF and recombinant IFN-G have been shown to be effective against the virus which causes AIDS and ARC in some laboratory studies but may increase virus replication in other laboratory studies. Previous studies in humans showed no increase in virus cultures and some decrease in measurements of virus. Extensive preclinical data show that TNF and IFN-G are more effective together than separately in laboratory and animal studies. As single agents both TNF and IFN-G have modest effect against HIV. Studies have demonstrated that TNF and IFN-G in combination can not only inhibit HIV infection of previously uninfected cells but also can selectively induce the destruction of acutely infected target cells.    ,NCT00001004
HIV,A Study of Zidovudine Plus Interleukin-2 in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have No Symptoms of Infection But Who Have Tender Lymph Nodes, AMENDED: To investigate whether subcutaneous (SC) injection of IL-2 produces biological responses which parallel those observed with IV dosing. Original design: To evaluate the short-term effects of combined administration of zidovudine (AZT) and increasing doses of recombinant interleukin-2 (aldesleukin; IL-2) in patients infected with HIV who have lymphadenopathy but who are otherwise asymptomatic (no other symptoms). The first phase of this clinical trial will establish maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ). How quickly the drugs get into the blood and how long they remain there (pharmacokinetics) will also be studied at each dose as well as the effect on HIV. Since AZT has no effect on cells that contain inactive virus (latently infected cells) and these cells may act as viral reservoirs that a second agent that can destroy these infected cells would be useful in combination with AZT. The different activities of AZT and IL-2 as well as the non-overlapping nature of their mechanisms of action and toxicity increase the theoretical benefits of combining AZT a drug which has clinically significant activity in HIV-related disease but cannot eliminate infected cells with IL-2 a drug which may enhance anti-HIV immunity destroy chronically infected cells and allow immune recognition of latently infected cells.    ,NCT00001005
HIV,A Study of AS-101 in Patients With AIDS or AIDS Related Complex (ARC), To determine the toxic effects of AS-101 at various doses in patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex. Also to determine the effect of various doses of AS-101 on immune functions and the occurrence of infections in these patients. AIDS is a viral disease that is characterized by a loss of some immune function and the development of frequent eventually fatal infectious diseases. Although zidovudine (AZT) has prolonged survival in some patients with AIDS AZT is quite toxic and there is a need for more effective and less toxic drugs. AS-101 is a synthetic organic compound containing the metal tellurium that is being tested because in laboratory studies it improved immune functions.    ,NCT00001006
HIV,A Study of Zidovudine in Infants Exposed to the HIV Before or Soon After Birth, To determine if intravenous (IV) and oral zidovudine (AZT) can be safely given to children aged 1 day to 3 months who were born to mothers with an HIV infection. Also to determine the correct dose of AZT for young children. Of a total of 908 pediatric AIDS cases 78 percent have acquired HIV infection from a mother with HIV infection or at high risk for acquisition of HIV and the number of cases in children is expected to increase over the next several years. AZT therapy may be effective in altering the course of the disease and decreasing the high mortality in these children. It is also possible that early intervention with AZT may prevent the establishment of HIV contracted before during or just after birth.    ,NCT00001007
HIV,A Study of Azidothymidine Plus Methadone in Patients With AIDS and AIDS Related Complex (ARC), To determine if methadone treatment will affect the blood levels of zidovudine (AZT) in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) who are receiving oral AZT and methadone therapy. In addition the blood levels of methadone both before and during AZT treatment will be studied and patients receiving daily oral methadone treatment will be evaluated for signs of narcotic withdrawal during treatment with AZT. The number of deaths due to AIDS in high-risk populations continues to increase. Nationwide approximately 25 percent of AIDS patients are intravenous (IV) drug abusers and it is very likely that an increasingly larger number of AIDS patients receiving AZT therapy will have had a history of IV drug abuse. The major chemical treatment for IV drug abuse is daily methadone maintenance therapy and IV drug abusers who are HIV positive represent a large number of patients who will undergo long-term treatment with both methadone and AZT. Therefore the study of potential drug interactions is essential.    ,NCT00001008
HIV,A Study of Dextran Sulfate in HIV-Infected Patients and in Patients With AIDS or AIDS Related Complex (ARC), To determine the effectiveness and safety of dextran sulfate (DS) as a treatment for patients with AIDS AIDS related complex (ARC) or asymptomatic HIV infection with or without persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and to determine antiviral activity at different doses of DS. Although zidovudine (AZT) has shown promise in prolonging life in patients with AIDS and severe ARC it has significant blood toxicities. It would be beneficial to combine AZT with another antiviral agent that does not have the same toxicity. DS might be a suitable drug since it has shown antiviral activity against HIV in the laboratory and in preliminary studies it has shown little toxicity. Also the combination of DS with AZT has been shown to be more effective than either alone.    ,NCT00001009
HIV,A Study of Zidovudine Plus Acyclovir in HIV-Infected Patients, To compare the effect of zidovudine (AZT) given alone with the combination of AZT and acyclovir (ACV) on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in persons infected with HIV and to study the pharmacokinetics (how fast AZT reaches certain levels in blood and how long it remains) safety and effectiveness of AZT given alone and in combination with ACV in treating HIV-infected patients. Other studies have shown that AZT offers potential benefits to specific AIDS patients when given over long time periods and experiments in vitro (in the test tube) suggest that ACV may stimulate the action of AZT against HIV. It is necessary to obtain information on how these drugs perform in HIV-infected humans.    ,NCT00001010
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of Zidovudine in the Treatment of Patients With Early AIDS Related Complex, To determine the safety and usefulness of zidovudine (AZT) for the treatment of patients with early symptomatic HIV infection or early AIDS related complex (ARC). The ability of AZT to suppress HIV to improve body defenses and to prevent the occurrence or development of AIDS or advanced ARC is being evaluated. In one human study patients with AIDS or advanced ARC who received AZT had fewer life-threatening infections improved in weight and performance and lived longer than patients who received a placebo (inactive medication). Further studies are needed because toxic effects associated with the use of AZT were noted and the long-term effectiveness and toxicity of AZT are still unknown. It is also unknown if AZT will benefit patients with less severe HIV infections such as early ARC or PGL.    ,NCT00001011
HIV,A Study of AL721 in HIV-Infected Patients With Swollen Lymph Nodes, To study the tolerance and safety of increasing doses of AL-721 in patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and symptomatic HIV infection and to obtain preliminary information on the effectiveness of AL-721 against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in HIV-infected persons with PGL and symptomatic HIV infection. Although zidovudine (AZT) prolongs life in certain AIDS patients it is not a cure for AIDS and it also has toxic effects in many patients. Therefore it is necessary to test other drugs in HIV-infected patients. AL-721 is a mixture of lipids (fats) extracted from egg yolks. Laboratory tests suggest that it might inhibit the infectivity of the HIV. AL-721 has been tried so far in a few patients for short periods of time and has been found to be well tolerated.    ,NCT00001012
HIV,A Study of Ribavirin in the Treatment of Patients With AIDS and AIDS-Related Problems, To determine the maximum long-term dosage of ribavirin (RBV) that is safe and free of serious side effects in patients with AIDS or AIDS related illnesses. Also to determine what effect different dosage levels have on biologic markers of efficacy such as the amount of the AIDS virus (HIV) or number of T cells in the patient's blood. RBV is a new drug capable of inhibiting the growth of the AIDS virus in the laboratory with little effect on normal human cells. In earlier tests of RBV in AIDS patients the drug was well tolerated and safe and this favorable result suggested that RBV should be more extensively studied in patients with AIDS and advanced AIDS related complex (ARC).    ,NCT00001015
HIV,Safety of and Immune Response to an HIV Vaccine (SF-2 gp120) With or Without MTP-PE/MF59 Adjuvant, Part A: To compare the safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels of gp120 (CHO) in MF59 emulsion alone or with MTP-PE/MF59 adjuvant administered at 0 1 and 6 months. Part B: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of gp120 in MF59 when administered in five monthly injections. One experimental AIDS vaccine is the gp120 vaccine. The HIV envelope glycoprotein 120 is manufactured through recombinant DNA technology and used as an immunogen. Antibodies directed against gp120 can neutralize HIV-1 and gp120 can also stimulate certain types of cell-mediated immune responses. Because many immunogens including candidate HIV vaccines may evoke relatively weak immune responses the use of adjuvants or substances that augment immune responses to vaccines is of interest. MTP-PE/MF59 composed of the immunomodulator MTP-PE combined with MF59 emulsion appears to be a promising adjuvant and has been selected for studies with the gp120 vaccine.    ,NCT00001019
HIV,A Phase I Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of rgp120/HIV-1IIIB Vaccine in Healthy Adult Subjects (NOTE: Study Extended ONLY for Subjects Who Have Previously Received rgp120/HIV-1IIIB or rgp120/HIV-1MN on VEU 006 or VEU 006 Rollover Study), AMENDED 11/17/93: To determine whether the pattern of response to MN rgp120 vaccine is altered by pre-exposure to IIIB rgp120. ORIGINAL DESIGN: To evaluate the safety (clinical and immunologic) of rgp120/HIV-1IIIB vaccine (gp120 vaccine) immunization in healthy HIV-1 seronegative adult subjects. To compare the immune response to 100 mcg gp120 vaccine versus 300 mcg gp120 vaccine. To determine whether gp120 vaccine immunization causes a significant immune response as defined by specific parameters (e.g. induction of neutralizing antibodies to the IIIB isolate of HIV-1 gp120 antigen-specific lymphocytic proliferation). Recent evidence suggests that gp120 is the HIV-1 protein with the greatest potential as a vaccine against HIV-1 infection. The gp120 envelope protein may be produced by recombinant DNA technology and studies have shown that the vaccine is capable of eliciting neutralizing antibody activity in both rodents and nonhuman primate species.    ,NCT00001020
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of MN rgp120/HIV-1 Vaccine Given Either Alone or in Combination With IIIB rgp120/HIV-1 Vaccine in Healthy Adult Subjects (NOTE: Original Study Extended ONLY for Patients Previously Enrolled on VEU 009), AMENDED 10/1/93: To evaluate the influence of prior immunization with an rgp120 vaccine on immune response to a subsequent immunization with a different strain of rgp120 (VEU 009X extension - in patients previously enrolled on VEU 009). ORIGINAL DESIGN: To evaluate the clinical and immunologic safety of MN rgp120/HIV-1 vaccine (MN rgp120 vaccine) given alone or concurrently with the IIIB rgp120/HIV-1 vaccine (IIIB rgp120 vaccine) in healthy HIV-1 seronegative adult subjects. To compare the immune response to MN rgp120 vaccine given at 100 300 or 600 mcg. To determine the immune response to 300 mcg MN rgp120 vaccine and 300 mcg IIIB rgp120 vaccine given concurrently. Recent studies suggest that immunity to the HIV-1 rgp120 protein may prevent primary infection. MN rgp120 vaccine and IIIB rgp120 vaccine are both prepared by recombinant DNA technology. Because the two vaccines are derived from distinct HIV-1 strains they may elicit some immunologic responses that differ. Unlike IIIB rgp120 vaccine the MN rgp120 vaccine has not yet been evaluated in humans although it is expected that the MN type will result in similar safety and immunogenicity as the IIIB type.    ,NCT00001021
HIV,A Comparison of Zidovudine (AZT) Used Alone or in Combination With Didanosine (ddI) or Dideoxycytidine (ddC) in HIV-Infected Patients, Primary: To compare the efficacy of zidovudine ( AZT ) given alone versus AZT plus didanosine ( ddI ) versus AZT plus zalcitabine ( dideoxycytidine; ddC ) in delaying the occurrence of AIDS-related conditions in HIV-infected patients. Secondary: To compare the frequency and severity of adverse experiences in the three regimens. To compare the mortality rates in the three regimens. To compare the effects of antiretroviral regimens on CD4+ cell levels. Studies have indicated that maintenance therapy with AZT over extended periods may be limited by dose-dependent toxicity primarily myelosuppression and by the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains. It is anticipated that the combination of AZT with either ddI or ddC may promote higher antiviral efficacy with acceptable toxicity and less likelihood of development of drug-resistant strains than AZT alone.    ,NCT00001022
HIV,The Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-Infected Patients Who Do Not Have AIDS, Immunopathogenesis objectives: To compare and quantitatively determine HIV burden and HIV replication in peripheral blood (PB) and lymphoid tissue (LT). To determine the degree to which antiretroviral therapy alters HIV replication in LT. Clinical objectives: To gain insight into the degree of correlation between immunologic surrogate markers for HIV disease (e.g. CD4 beta-2 microglobulin) as compared to measures of HIV replication in PB and LT. To assess changes in PB and LT viral burden after antiretroviral therapy and to determine its ability to predict an antiviral response. One of the major problems in defining the immunopathogenic changes in HIV infections has been the inability to correlate the extent of loss of immunologic function with the number of HIV-infected CD4+ cells in the peripheral blood. Few studies exist that measure viral burden in lymph nodes of HIV-infected individuals. Researchers hope to find out whether the amount of HIV virus or markers for the virus in the body's lymph tissue is a better measure of disease progression than the amount of virus or markers for the virus in the blood.    ,NCT00001024
HIV,Evaluation of Patients Who Have Not Had Success With Zidovudine, To determine the relationship of viral susceptibility to zidovudine (AZT) and baseline viral load (as determined by plasma viremia and quantitative endpoint dilution). To determine the relationship between viral load and susceptibility during different antiretroviral therapy strategies. To correlate measures of viral load and short term clinical and laboratory markers (such as weight CD4 count p24 antigenemia and beta2 microglobulin) on the different therapy arms. High-grade resistance to AZT has been detected in HIV isolates from approximately 25 percent of individuals with AIDS who received AZT for at least 1 year. To elucidate the clinical significance of in vitro AZT resistance it is necessary to distinguish between clinical failure caused by AZT resistance and clinical decompensation caused by other factors.    ,NCT00001025
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Recombinant Vaccinia-HIV Envelope Vaccine (HIVAC-1e) in Combination With a Panel of Subunit Recombinant HIV Envelope Vaccines in Vaccinia-Naive Individuals, Primary: To determine whether combination vaccination i.e. priming with a vaccinia recombinant-containing HIV envelope (HIVAC-1e) followed by boosting with a recombinant subunit envelope protein (gp160 or gp120) provides enhanced immunogenicity compared to subunit vaccination with the individual recombinant envelope proteins only. To compare the relative immunogenicity of a panel of HIV envelope subunit vaccines when administered as boosters following recombinant HIV-vaccinia priming. To evaluate the relative immunogenicity of one versus two doses of recombinant HIV-vaccinia prior to the subunit protein boost. Secondary: To examine the safety of administering the individual subunit vaccines in combination with the HIV envelope vaccinia recombinant and to extend the population to whom these proteins have been administered. Previous studies suggest that priming with an HIV-vaccinia recombinant followed by boosting with subunit envelope proteins offers the most promising strategy to date for a safe and immunogenic vaccine in humans. This study will further examine the combination vaccine approach and define an optimal prime-boost strategy.    ,NCT00001026
HIV,A Comparison of Three Treatments for Advanced HIV Disease in Patients Who Have Received Nucleoside Therapy in the Past, To compare the efficacy safety and tolerance and other clinical and immunologic effects of zidovudine (AZT) plus zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) AZT plus didanosine (ddI) and AZT alternating monthly with ddI as measured by differences in survival among HIV-infected persons who have received 6 or more months of nucleoside monotherapy and have a CD4 count greater than or equal to 50 cells/mm3. Combining two nucleoside drugs has the theoretical advantage of optimal protection against the evolution of resistant strains of HIV. However one major problem with combination nucleoside therapy in patients with advanced disease is the increased toxicity resulting from such therapy. One approach to minimize toxicity while perhaps retaining some of the benefits of combination therapy is to alternate the two drugs.    ,NCT00001029
HIV,A Phase II Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Immunogenicity and Reactogenicity of the Recombinant HIV-1 Envelope Vaccines SF-2 rgp120 (CHO) [Chiron Vaccines] in MF59 Adjuvant and MN rgp120/HIV-1 [VaxGen] in Alum Adjuvant in Healthy Adults, To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of SF-2 rgp120 vaccine in MF59 versus MN rgp120 vaccine in alum in volunteers who are seronegative for HIV-1. AS PER AMENDMENT 07/02/97: To determine the ability of immunization with MN rgp120/HIV-1 in combination with alum or SF-2 rgp120 in combination with MF59 to induce an HIV-1 envelope-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in volunteers who receive rsgp120/MN skin testing. The amino acid sequence of HIV-1 gp120 can vary as much as 40 percent from isolate to isolate. Thus the identification of an immunogen that can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 is a major challenge in AIDS vaccine development. Two candidate vaccines recombinant envelope subunit proteins from the SF-2 and MN isolates of HIV-1 have shown immunogenicity and good tolerance in healthy immunocompetent adults. This study will expand testing into a larger population base particularly targeting individuals at high risk for HIV infection.    ,NCT00001031
HIV,A Study of Dideoxycytidine Plus Zidovudine (AZT) in HIV-Infected Children Who Have Taken AZT, PRIMARY: To determine safety tolerance and pharmacokinetics of zidovudine (AZT) and zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) when given in combination in clinically stable AZT-treated children. SECONDARY: To compare combination therapy with mono drug therapy for antiviral activity and laboratory markers of disease progression as determined by virologic and immunologic determinations. To evaluate the influence of combination therapy on disease progression as determined by evaluation of clinical criteria. In children currently being treated with AZT it is unknown whether the addition of another antiretroviral agent such as ddC would help increase efficacy and tolerance. This study will examine the possible advantages of combination AZT/ddC therapy over monotherapy with AZT alone.    ,NCT00001032
HIV,The Treatment of Tuberculosis in HIV-Infected Patients, PER 5/30/95 AMENDMENT: To compare the combined rate of failure during therapy and relapse after therapy between two durations of intermittent therapy (6 versus 9 months) for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-infected patients. To compare toxicity survival and development of resistance in these two regimens. ORIGINAL: To compare the efficacy and safety of induction and continuation therapies for the treatment of pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients who are either from areas with known high rates of resistance to one or more anti-TB drugs or from areas where TB is expected to be susceptible to commonly used anti-TB drugs. PER 5/30/95 AMENDMENT: In HIV-negative patients intermittent anti-TB therapy has been shown to be as effective as daily therapy but the optimal duration of therapy in HIV-infected patients has not been established. ORIGINAL: In some areas of the country resistance to one or more of the drugs commonly used to treat TB has emerged. Thus the need to test regimens containing a new drug exists. Furthermore the optimal duration of anti-TB therapy for HIV-infected patients with TB needs to be determined.    ,NCT00001033
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of a Two-Drug Combination in the Treatment of Patients With Hepatitis C Plus Advanced HIV Infections, To investigate the toxicity of interferon alfa-2b ( IFN alfa-2b ) in combination with nucleoside analog therapy in HIV-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C. To determine the efficacy of treatment with IFN alfa-2b for chronic hepatitis C in patients with advanced HIV infections treated with nucleoside analog therapy. IFN alfa-2b has HIV inhibitory properties and has also been approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Studies have shown that IFN alfa-2b is effective in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C but the drug's benefit against hepatitis C in patients with advanced HIV infection has not been determined.    ,NCT00001035
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of a Type of Interleukin-2 Plus Zidovudine Plus Thymosin in HIV-Positive Patients With and Without Symptoms of Infection, To determine the safety of thymosin alpha 1 given twice weekly in a regimen of daily oral zidovudine (AZT) and biweekly polyethylene glycolated interleukin-2 (PEG IL-2). To determine the effect of thymosin alpha 1 and PEG IL-2 in combination with AZT on immunologic and pharmacokinetic markers. AIDS is characterized by diminished T helper cell number and function. Thymosin alpha 1 appears to both increase IL-2 receptors on lymphocytes in vitro and enhance lymphocyte maturation in vivo; thus the drug may further enhance the CD4 T cell levels in patients receiving AZT and PEG IL-2.    ,NCT00001036
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccinia-Derived MN HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein (rgp160) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus at Two Different Vaccination Schedules, To determine the safety and immunogenicity of 200 mcg MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) versus placebo administered on two immunization schedules to healthy volunteers. Per 06/15/94 amendment to determine the safety and immunogenicity of 800 versus 200 mcg given as a fourth immunization at 9 or 11 months after the third injection (i.e. at month 17). A gp160 vaccine developed from the IIIB strain of HIV-1 has been found to be safe and immunogenic in healthy adults. Since the MN strain of HIV-1 is representative of a larger proportion of HIV-1 isolates in the United States than is the IIIB strain evaluation of a gp160 vaccine derived from the MN strain is important.    ,NCT00001037
HIV,Comparison of Ro 31-8959 Plus Zidovudine (AZT) Versus AZT Plus Zalcitabine (ddC) Versus Ro 31-8959 Plus AZT Plus ddC, PRIMARY: To determine the efficacy and toxicity of three treatment regimens: saquinavir mesylate (Ro 31-8959) plus zidovudine (AZT) vs. AZT plus zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) vs. Ro 31-8959 plus AZT plus ddC. SECONDARY: To investigate the pharmacokinetics and effects on various clinical parameters of the three regimens.    ,NCT00001040
HIV,Active Immunization of HIV-1 Infected Pregnant Women With CD4 Lymphocyte Counts >= 400/mm3: A Phase I Study of Safety and Immunogenicity of MN rgp120/HIV-1 Vaccine (NOTE: Some Patients Receive Placebo), To evaluate the safety of rgp120/HIV-1MN vaccine in HIV-1 infected pregnant women with CD4 counts >= 400 cells/mm3. To evaluate the immunogenicity of this vaccine in pregnant women and the passive acquisition of vaccine-specific antibody in their infants. To evaluate the induction or augmentation by rgp120/HIV-1MN vaccine of mucosal immune response in the gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts during pregnancy. To isolate and genetically characterize the HIV-1 present in cervicovaginal fluid specimens of pregnant women and compare it to that present in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells and to that of their infected infants. Evidence suggests that an advanced stage of disease with high plasma viremia is associated with increased transmission of HIV-1 to the fetus. Slowing the progression of disease reducing the titer of virus in plasma and increasing the titer of epitope-specific antibody are potentially attainable goals through active immunization of the mother during pregnancy.    ,NCT00001041
HIV,A Phase I Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial to Compare the Safety and Immunogenicity of Recombinant Envelope Protein rgp120/HIV-1SF2 (BIOCINE) Combined With Seven Adjuvants in Healthy HIV-1 Uninfected Individuals, To determine in healthy HIV-negative volunteers the safety and immunogenicity of rgp120/HIV-1SF2 (BIOCINE) formulated with each of seven adjuvants. PER AMENDMENT 3/6/96: Purpose of the extension study - To determine the ability of immunization with rgp 120/SF-2 to induce an HIV-1 envelope-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in volunteers who receive rsgp 120/MN skin testing. One approach to improve the immunogenicity of an HIV-1 subunit protein vaccine is to combine the immunogen with an adjuvant. Adjuvants may augment vaccine immunogenicity by several mechanisms and as a result induce a more favorable antibody response with high titers which appear earlier in the course of immunization and persist over time.    ,NCT00001042
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccinia-Derived MN HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein (rgp160) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus at Two Different Vaccination Schedules, AMENDED 8/94: To expand the safety and immunogenicity profile of MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) by administering a higher dose (800 mcg) at 0 1 6 and 12 months and 0 2 8 and 14 months (these two schedules were compared in VEU 013A using a dose of 200 mcg). To obtain plasma following the fourth immunization. To evaluate skin test reactivity. ORIGINAL (replaced): To determine in healthy volunteers the safety and immunogenicity of two immunizations of MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) in combination with a live recombinant vaccinia virus LAV HIV-1 gp160 vaccine (HIVAC-1e) versus DryVax (the standard smallpox vaccine that was used for many years) control in combination with placebo. ORIGINAL (replaced): A gp160 vaccine derived from the MN strain the most prevalent strain of HIV-1 in the United States has been developed. A previous study showed that a combination vaccine strategy consisting of priming with HIVAC-1e followed by boosting with a gp160 subunit vaccine resulted in humoral and cellular immune responses of greater and longer duration than either vaccine alone. Thus a live vector/subunit boost approach using the MN rgp160 vaccine merits investigation.    ,NCT00001043
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled HIV-1 Vaccine Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of rgp120/HIV-1MN (Genentech) in Combination With QS21 Adjuvant and/or Alum in Healthy Adults., PRIMARY: To examine the safety and potential improvement in immune responses elicited by combining rsgp120/HIV-1MN with the adjuvant QS-21. SECONDARY: To examine the role of alum in the vaccine/adjuvant formulation; to determine the optimal dose ratio of vaccine to adjuvant; and to obtain initial information on the optimal schedule of administration. AS PER AMENDMENT 07/02/97: To determine the ability of immunization with rsgp120/HV-1MN in combination with QS21 with or without alum to induce an HIV-1 envelope-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in volunteers who undergo rsgp120/MN skin testing. Immune responses in HIV-uninfected individuals receiving subunit envelope vaccines formulated with alum adjuvant suggest that functional antibodies capable of neutralizing HIV-1 in vitro may be induced but the titers are relatively low in comparison to those measured in individuals with natural HIV-1 infection. These limitations might be overcome by the addition or substitution of a more suitable adjuvant such as QS-21.    ,NCT00001044
HIV,Comparison of Three Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Patients With No Symptoms of the Disease, To validate that the alteration of codon 215 of reverse transcriptase in plasma virus precedes the increase in viral burden as measured in the peripheral blood and the decline in CD4 count that have been observed in association with clinical failure on zidovudine (AZT). To determine whether alternative regimens of antiretroviral agents alter the course of viral burden as measured in the peripheral blood and CD4 changes in patients with HIV infection. To obtain further data on the safety and immunologic and virologic response to AZT/didanosine/nevirapine. Of the HIV-1 mutations reported to be associated with zidovudine resistance the mutation at codon 215 of the reverse transcriptase gene is the most commonly occurring and has the greatest impact on susceptibility. When this mutation appears a change in drugs may prevent further immunologic and virologic deterioration.    ,NCT00001045
HIV,Active Immunization of HIV-Infected Pregnant Women: A Phase I Study of Safety and Immunogenicity of a rgp120/HIV-1 Vaccine (NOTE: Some Patients Receive Placebo), PRIMARY: To evaluate the short-term safety of rgp120/HIV-1SF2 vaccine versus MF59 placebo administered to HIV-infected pregnant women. SECONDARY: To evaluate the immunogenicity and long-term safety of rgp120/HIV-1SF2 in HIV-infected pregnant women who received the vaccine during pregnancy only or during pregnancy and postpartum. To evaluate immunogenicity and safety in the infant through 18 months of age following maternal immunization with the vaccine during pregnancy. Active immunization of HIV-infected women during pregnancy may slow the progression of maternal disease reduce the titer of virus in maternal plasma and increase the titer of epitope-specific antibody. Also active immunization has the potential to induce primary immunity in the fetus and to boost both T-cell and humoral immune responses to HIV in the mothers.    ,NCT00001046
HIV,Comparison of Anti HIV Drugs Used Alone or in Combination With Cytosine Arabinoside to Treat Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) in HIV-Infected Patients, To compare the safety and efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (zidovudine plus either didanosine or dideoxycytidine) versus antiretroviral therapy plus intravenous cytarabine (Ara-C) versus antiretroviral therapy plus intrathecal Ara-C in the maintenance or improvement of neurological function over 6 months in HIV-infected individuals who have developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). To compare the effect of these three treatment regimens on Karnofsky score and MRI studies. The effectiveness of Ara-C in the treatment of PML caused by a human DNA papovavirus (designated JC virus) infection has not been determined although the most encouraging results have occurred with intrathecal administration of the drug.    ,NCT00001048
HIV,A Study of Didanosine Use Alone or in Combination With Zidovudine in Infants Exposed to or Infected With HIV, To determine the pharmacokinetics safety and efficacy of didanosine (ddI) alone or in combination with zidovudine (AZT) in HIV-infected infants. PER AMENDMENT 4/8/97: Part A study objectives are completed. Part B objectives: To assess the safety toxicity and tolerability and to compare anti-HIV activity as measured by change in log10 RNA of the two study arms. Early treatment of HIV-infected infants with antiretroviral agents may prevent the early and rapid decline of CD4 count and immunologic function. Combination therapy may be preferred over monotherapy since resistance to a single agent can develop rapidly. Currently there is little information on ddI monotherapy in young infants less than 90 days and no information on the use of combination therapy in this population.    ,NCT00001049
HIV,Study of Women Who Have AIDS, To study the effect of pregnancy age drug use and coinfections on HIV progression rate. To document the prevalence incidence characteristics and course of HIV infection and anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. To study the effect of HIV disease on gynecologic health including infections and reproductive function.    ,NCT00001050
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled HIV-1 Vaccine Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of MN Recombinant Soluble gp120/HIV-1 (rsgp120/HIV-1) (Genentech) in Combination With QS21 Adjuvant and/or Alum in Healthy Adults, To extend the evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of MN recombinant soluble gp120/HIV-1 (MN rsgp120/HIV-1) in combination with QS21 with or without alum and on two different vaccination schedules. Recent animal studies indicate that immunizing with MN rsgp120/HIV-1 in combination with QS21 on a 0 1 2 month schedule results in a more rapid rise in binding and neutralizing antibody response than on a 0 1 6 month schedule. Such an effect may be particularly desirable in vaccine delivery. This study compares these two delivery schedules using the unadjuvanted vaccine formulation rsgp120/HIV-1 with or without addition of alum.    ,NCT00001052
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Study of HIV p17/p24:Ty-VLP in HIV-1 Seronegative Subjects, To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HIV p17/p24:Ty-VLP (virus-like particles) vaccine in uninfected volunteers. Specifically to determine whether the vaccine formulated with and without alum induces CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) that may be cross-reactive against multiple HIV-1 stains. Also to determine whether boosting with the vaccine orally or rectally will help induce mucosal antibody responses. Induction of CD8+ CTL activity is considered a critical property for a candidate vaccine. Additionally since the majority of HIV-1 infections occur after inoculation of a mucosal surface it is desirable to induce mucosal immunity as well as systemic immunity. The HIV p17/p24:Ty-VLP vaccine may potentially induce both CTL and mucosal antibody responses against HIV-1.    ,NCT00001053
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Live Recombinant Canarypox ALVAC-HIV (vCP205) in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Volunteers, To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ALVAC-HIV MN120TMG (vCP205) in comparison to ALVAC-RG rabies glycoprotein (vCP65) as a control when administered in HIV-1 negative volunteers. ALVAC-HIV vCP205 is a second generation candidate vaccine that can be used to induce a humoral and cellular response against several antigens. This recombinant construct is based on the canarypox vector termed ALVAC and expresses gp120 of the HIV MN strain plus the transmembrane portion of the LAI strain as well as gag and protease.    ,NCT00001055
HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccinia Derived HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein (gp160) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus: Evaluation of a 200-mcg Dose, To determine the safety of and immune response to vaccinia-derived HIV-1 recombinant envelope glycoprotein (gp160) at a dose of 200 mcg in human volunteers; to evaluate duration of antibody response and its relationship to the dose and frequency of inoculation. Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy against AIDS there is currently no cure for AIDS. It is likely that the ultimate control of the disease depends on the development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.    ,NCT00001056
HIV,The Effectiveness of Two Anti-HIV Treatments in HIV-Infected Patients, To determine the effects of zidovudine (AZT) alone and in combination with didanosine (ddI) on viral load in the lymphoid tissue and blood of antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts greater than or equal to 550 cells/mm3. Recent studies have shown that during the asymptomatic phase (clinical latency) of HIV infection there is an extraordinarily large number of infected CD4+ lymphocytes and macrophages throughout the lymphoid system both in latent and productive states. These findings support the belief that early intervention therapy with reverse transcriptase inhibitors could prolong the clinical latency period.    ,NCT00001057
HIV,A Phase I Trial of HIV-1 C4-V3 Polyvalent Peptide Vaccine in HIV-1 Infected Persons, To determine the safety of immunization with HIV-1 C4-V3 polyvalent peptide vaccine in HIV-infected persons. To determine the proportion of study participants immunized who develop new specificities or increased levels of neutralizing and other antibody responses T-cell proliferative responses and Class I restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses. HIV-1 C4-V3 polyvalent peptide vaccine contains amino acid sequences for selected epitopes from four of the most common HIV isolates in the United States and Europe predicted to represent about 50-90 percent of the HIV isolates in the United States. It includes epitopes that generate potentially salutary immune responses and deletes epitopes that generate immune responses which might contribute to further immunopathogenesis.    ,NCT00001060
HIV,The Effectiveness of Three Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Taken Zidovudine for More Than 12 Weeks, To compare the effect of stavudine (d4T) alone or with zidovudine (AZT) versus didanosine (ddI) alone or with AZT on CD4 counts HIV RNA levels and viral load in HIV-infected patients [AS PER AMENDMENT 3/21/97: To compare the effects of d4T alone versus ddI alone versus AZT plus ddI]. To compare the safety of d4T/AZT. AS PER AMENDMENT 3/21/97: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic interactions of AZT and d4T both at an extracellular and intracellular level. Although AZT and ddI can delay the advancement of HIV disease the benefit of either of these drugs has proven to be only temporary. d4T a new nucleoside analog with a favorable toxicity profile and demonstrated activity against HIV offers an additional therapeutic option. It is reasonably assumed that the benefit of an antiretroviral agent in terms of delaying clinical disease progression is directly related to its ability to achieve and sustain viral suppression; thus this study measures effects on viral load and CD4 count.    ,NCT00001063
HIV,A Pilot Study of Immunization With HIV-1 Antigen Pulsed Allogenic Dendritic Cells in HIV-Infected Asymptomatic Patients With CD4+ T Cells > 350 Cells/mm3, To define the safety and efficacy of sibling-supplied HIV antigen-pulsed dendritic cells in increasing the immune response in HIV-infected patients. Dendritic cells are a type of white blood cell used by the body to fight infection. They are instrumental in presenting antigens (such as HIV antigens) to the body's immune system. Since dendritic cells are not functioning maximally in HIV-infected patients infusion of dendritic cells from an HIV-negative sibling may enable the affected sibling's immune system to recognize foreign particles more readily and increase immune response against the virus.    ,NCT00001064
HIV,A Comparison of Zidovudine Plus Lamivudine Versus ddI Used Alone or in Combination With Zidovudine in HIV-1 Infected Children, To compare the efficacy of lamivudine (3TC) and zidovudine (AZT) in combination versus the better of didanosine (ddI) monotherapy or ddI/AZT combination in symptomatic HIV-1 infected children who received less than 56 days of prior antiretroviral therapy. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of 3TC/AZT in this patient population. To determine other measures of diseases in response to the study regimens. Currently none of the potential treatments for HIV-1 infection has proven to be both nontoxic and effective in long-term use. However previous studies in both adults and children have shown that 3TC combined with AZT reduced HIV load in blood and increased white blood cells. Additionally 3TC has demonstrated a favorable safety profile.    ,NCT00001066
HIV,The Effectiveness of Three Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Never Used Anti-HIV Drugs, To determine drug efficacy and safety in HIV-infected patients treated with zidovudine ( AZT ) versus stavudine ( d4T ) versus both drugs. Also to compare short- and long-term changes in magnitude of HIV RNA over time. Asymptomatic patients with CD4 counts over 300 cells/mm3 are more likely to tolerate any of the nucleoside analogs. d4T with a favorable toxicity profile and demonstrated anti-HIV activity in previous studies provides an additional therapeutic option.    ,NCT00001067
HIV,A Study of Disease Progression and Anti-HIV Treatments, To determine the influence of virus load CD4 count biologic phenotype and presence of symptomatic disease on the response of HIV-infected patients to a new therapeutic regimen. PER AMENDMENT 8/27/96: To extend the availability of currently assigned ACTG 303 treatment for 6 months.    ,NCT00001068
HIV,A Study of Two Methods of Determining When to Begin or Change Anti-HIV Treatment, PRIMARY: To compare the clinical efficacy of two decision making strategies for initiating or changing antiretroviral therapy: decision making based on current clinical practice alone (i.e. initiating or changing therapy based on CD4 count decline and/or clinical progression) versus decision making based on plasma HIV RNA quantitation in addition to current clinical practice. SECONDARY: To evaluate toxicity biological markers and patient management in the two arms. Although changing therapies is a common strategy in the treatment of HIV disease guidelines are needed to help clinicians and patients decide when a change in antiretroviral therapy is indicated. The technology of measuring HIV RNA in plasma has been suggested as a tool for monitoring clinical drug efficacy. However uncertainty remains about whether aggressive antiretroviral treatment to lower HIV RNA and maintain low levels for as long as possible will confer clinical benefit in comparison with management based on monitoring CD4 counts and HIV-related symptoms.    ,NCT00001069

HIV,A Study of Stem Cells and Filgrastim, To determine the safety of stem cell harvesting after administration of filgrastim ( G-CSF ) to mobilize bone marrow stem cells into the peripheral blood in patients at various stages of HIV-1 infection as well as in HIV-negative volunteers. To determine the surface phenotypic and functional characteristics as well as the viral load in the stem cells obtained following this procedure.    ,NCT00001071
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Live Recombinant Canarypox ALVAC-HIV vCP300 and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Volunteers, To evaluate in HIV-negative volunteers the safety and immunogenicity of ALVAC-HIV MN120TMGNP (vCP300) followed by or combined with boosting using rgp120/HIV-1SF2. To compare ALVAC-HIV vCP300 with ALVAC-RG rabies glycoprotein (vCP65) as a control. To evaluate an accelerated immunization schedule at 0 1 3 and 6 months versus 0 1 6 and 9 months. The combination of a live recombinant primer followed by a subunit boost has the potential to induce not only cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also neutralizing antibody.    ,NCT00001072
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Giving Isotretinoin to HIV-Infected Women to Treat Cervical Tumors, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give isotretinoin to HIV-infected women with cervical tumors to prevent these tumors from becoming cancerous. Cervical tumors are found in both HIV-infected and HIV-negative women. However HIV-infected women are at a greater risk and often their tumors become cancerous more quickly than those in HIV-negative women. Isotretinoin may be able to prevent this from happening. However since these tumors tend to disappear over time many doctors are hesitant to give their patients isotretinoin since this drug causes birth defects. This study looks at whether it is better to treat cervical tumors in HIV-infected women or to wait and see if they will disappear by themselves.    ,NCT00001073
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of Hydroxyurea and ddI Used Individually or Together in HIV-Infected Patients, To determine the safety and tolerability of hydroxyurea at two doses alone and in combination with didanosine (ddI). To compare the short term antiviral effect of ddI monotherapy versus hydroxyurea plus ddI as measured by plasma RNA levels at 8 weeks of therapy. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/1/97: Accrual to arms involving hydroxyurea alone has been closed.] Current antiviral therapies for HIV-1 are limited by a few choices and the lack of sustained clinical benefit from the drugs. The mechanisms that account for the lack of prolonged inhibition of viral replication by these agents are not fully understood. The activity of RT inhibitors might be potentiated by inhibiting host cellular enzymes essential for efficient HIV reverse transcription. Based on this information comparisons of the antiviral effects of ddI monotherapy and hydroxyurea plus ddI with the cellular enzyme ribonucleotide reductase as a potential target should be done.    ,NCT00001074
HIV,The Effectiveness of Ritonavir Plus Zidovudine Plus Lamivudine in HIV-Infected Patients, To determine whether administration of a highly active antiretroviral treatment regimen consisting of ritonavir (ABT-538) zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) is associated with the restoration of delayed type hypersensitivity and lymphocyte proliferative responses in patients with moderately advanced HIV-1 infection. To better characterize in these patients the phenotype of the expanded lymphocyte subpopulations as well as the genotype phenotype and cellular origin of viruses that persist after initiation of therapy and the genotype and phenotype of drug-resistant isolates that emerge during therapy. Although plasma viral load drops dramatically after initiation of powerful antiretrovirals it does not drop to zero. It appears that a new steady state is reached suggesting that a reservoir may exist of virus-producing cells possibly cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage that continue to produce a low level of virus despite antiretroviral treatment.    ,NCT00001075
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Live Recombinant Canarypox ALVAC-HIV (vCP205) and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 in HIV-1 Uninfected Volunteers to Evaluate Accelerated Vaccine Schedules, To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an accelerated schedule of recombinant canarypox vaccine ALVAC-HIV MN120TMG (vCP205) versus control followed by boost with rgp120/HIV-1 SF2 vaccine in HIV-negative volunteers. Frequent injections of ALVAC-HIV vCP205 may result in more rapid induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. This trial will evaluate whether an accelerated vaccination schedule can produce immunological responses comparable to those obtained in other trials of ALVAC-HIV vCP205.    ,NCT00001076
HIV,A Comparison of Two Caloric Supplements in the Prevention of Weight Loss in Patients With AIDS Who Take Daily Multivitamin and Mineral Supplements, To compare a caloric supplement containing peptides and medium-chain triglycerides a caloric supplement containing whole protein and long-chain triglycerides and no caloric supplement for the prevention of weight loss in individuals with AIDS who take a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement.    ,NCT00001077
HIV,A Study on the Rate of Opportunistic (AIDS-Related) Infections Among HIV-Positive Children Who Have Stopped Taking Their OI Preventive Medications, The purpose of this study is to find out if it is safe for HIV-positive children who are responding well to their anti-HIV treatment to stop taking medications that prevent AIDS-related infections (opportunistic infections) such as pneumonia and other bacterial infections. This is an observational study meaning children will only be monitored to see if they develop any infections. Children have been receiving medications to prevent complications of HIV infection such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease or other bacterial infections. It is common for HIV-positive patients with low CD4 counts to receive these preventive medications. However these drugs can have serious side effects they are expensive and it is possible for bacteria resistant to the drugs to grow. For these reasons it may be beneficial to the child to stop taking these preventive medications if he/she has been on anti-HIV (antiretroviral) therapy and has improved CD4 counts. This study will look at how many children who stop taking their medications develop opportunistic infections.    ,NCT00001078
HIV,A Study of Megestrol Acetate Alone or in Combination With Testosterone Enanthate Drug in the Treatment of HIV-Associated Weight Loss, To test the hypothesis that the predominant accrual of fat rather than lean body mass (LBM) that occurs during treatment of HIV-associated wasting with megestrol acetate may be improved by treatment with megestrol acetate and testosterone enanthate in combination. Body wasting is an increasingly frequent AIDS-defining condition in individuals infected with HIV. Increasing caloric intake fails to consistently restore lean tissue patients with HIV associated weight loss. Megestrol acetate has been shown to stimulate appetite and weight gain in subjects with cancer and in those with HIV associated weight loss. However the weight gained during treatment with megestrol acetate was predominantly or exclusively fat. An important factor is the preferential increase in body fat seen in both of these studies may have been due to hypogonadism that occurs as a result of treatment with megestrol acetate a progestational agent. Hypogonadism is associated with an increase in body fat and a decrease in LBM. Concomitant testosterone replacement should substantially increase the amount of LBM accrued during megestrol acetate therapy. This study will determine whether anabolic potential can be realized when caloric intake is increased in the absence of concomitant hypogonadism.    ,NCT00001079
HIV,Effect of Vaccination on Turnover of Lamivudine (3TC) Sensitive and Resistant Virus Populations in HIV-1-Infected Individuals," To ascertain whether the origin of plasma HIV-1-RNA following T cell activation represents the activation of latently infected cells or an increase in cells permissive for replacing viral mutants. The mechanism by which immune stimulation increases circulating levels of HIV-1 is not known. In particular it is uncertain whether the transient increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA is due to enhanced replication of an actively replicating pool of HIV-1 or is due instead to activation of proviral sequences in previously resting CD4+ cells. One approach to discriminate these alternatives is a ""molecular pulse-chase"" experiment. In this approach drug resistant mutants would be selected by administration of Lamivudine (3TC).

HIV,Comparison of New Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Children Who Have Taken Anti-HIV Drugs, For PRAM-1: To evaluate zidovudine (ZDV) + lamivudine (3TC) vs. stavudine (d4T) + ritonavir vs. ZDV + 3TC + ritonavir with respect to the change in plasma HIV-1 RNA copy number from baseline to 48 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/5/98: 72 weeks; AS PER AMENDMENT 7/17/98: 48 weeks] in stable HIV-infected children with >= 16 weeks of prior continuous antiretroviral therapy. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of ZDV + 3TC vs. d4T + ritonavir vs. ZDV + 3TC + ritonavir based upon laboratory and clinical toxicities. AS PER AMENDMENT 10/20/97: For PRAM-1 Step 2: To evaluate d4T + nevirapine + ritonavir with respect to change in plasma HIV-1 RNA copy number from baseline to 48 weeks in children who have received at least 12 weeks of therapy on the PRAM-1 ZDV/3TC arm and have over 10000 viral copies at weeks 12 24 or 36. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of d4T + nevirapine + ritonavir based upon laboratory and clinical toxicities. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/23/98: To evaluate safety and tolerance of a switch from d4T + ritonavir vs. ZDV + 3TC + ritonavir to d4T + indinavir vs. ZDV + 3TC + indinavir in stable HIV-infected children with RNA values <= 10000 copies/ml.] For PRAM-1: Evidence supports combination therapy with 2 or more antiviral agents as beneficial in the long-term management of HIV. The possibility exists that combination therapy may result in a synergistic or additive activity over a prolonged period of time. Also hypothesized is that the development of resistance to individual agents will be developed if viral replication is significantly decreased. AS PER AMENDMENT 10/20/97: For PRAM-1 Step 2: Interim analysis at 12 weeks on PRAM-1 indicates that the proportion of children reaching undetectable RNA levels on the ZDV + 3TC arm is significantly less than the other two arms. The protocol therefore has been modified (Step 2) to permit children in the ZDV + 3TC arm with RNA copy number >= 10000 the opportunity to change to a novel therapeutic regimen (d4T + nevirapine + ritonavir).    ,NCT00001083
HIV,A Study of Three Treatment Combinations Using Zidovudine Plus Lamivudine Plus Indinavir in HIV-Infected Patients, To compare the proportion of patients who sustain suppression of plasma HIV RNA to undetectable levels [AS PER AMENDMENT 09/19/97: below 200 copies/mL by Roche UltraSensitive assay] among the 3 regimens during the maintenance phase. The objective of antiretroviral therapy is to reduce HIV replication preserve immunologic function and delay the development of HIV-related complications. In patients administered potent antiretroviral regimens HIV RNA levels are reduced below 500 copies/ml of plasma and below the level of detection of commercially available assays. This protocol attempts to learn if a less intensive regimen can successfully sustain viral suppression after induction with a triple-drug regimen. The study also addresses whether HIV can be eradicated in patients following prolonged treatment with induction and maintenance regimens.    ,NCT00001084
HIV,A Study of 141W94 Used Alone or in Combination With Zidovudine Plus 3TC in HIV-Infected Patients, To determine the proportion of patients whose plasma HIV-1 RNA level remains below a detectable level (less than 500/ml) after 24 weeks of study therapy with either 141W94 monotherapy or 141W94 plus zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (3TC). To determine the safety and tolerability of 141W94 monotherapy and the combination of 141W94 plus 3TC in patients with HIV infection. Although dramatic inhibition of HIV-1 replication is achieved with ritonavir or indinavir monotherapy in both cases maximum suppression required combination treatment together with nucleoside analog RT inhibitors. This study tests the hypothesis that monotherapy with 141W94 doses that result in Cmin levels far in excess of the IC90 corrected for plasma protein binding for HIV-1 can achieve the same virologic and immunologic effects in terms of magnitude and durability as has been observed with combinations of other protease inhibitors plus nucleoside analogs.    ,NCT00001085
HIV,A Study of Abacavir Plus Indinavir Sulfate Plus Efavirenz in HIV-Infected Patients, To compare the virologic response between abacavir (ABC 1592U89) regimens (drug vs. placebo) and between the 2 dosing regimens (BID vs. TID) with respect to the proportion of patients with plasma HIV RNA levels below the limit of detection [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/27/97: < 500 copies/ml at week 16]. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of the study arms. [AS PER AMENDMENT 3/10/99: During the extension period compare the time to detectable viremia (2 consecutive plasma HIV RNA levels greater than or equal to 500 copies/ml) between ABC and placebo.] Therapeutically there is a need to explore potent alternative therapy for patients who have received or are currently receiving a double nucleoside analog combination including lamivudine (3TC) a regimen that was proven to be clinically inferior to indinavir (IDV) when combined with zidovudine/3TC in study ACTG 320. In order to produce and maintain a maximal antiviral response all patients in this study will receive 2 or 3 potent new agents; ABC a nucleoside analog EFV a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and IDV a protease inhibitor. Virologically the major question this protocol seeks to answer is how prior 3TC exposure in a dual nucleoside regimen influences the response to subsequent treatment. It is unclear whether it is best to add a protease inhibitor either 1) an NNRTI at 1 of 2 doses or 2) an NNRTI at 1 of 2 doses plus a new nucleoside analog to achieve plasma HIV RNA levels that are below the limits of detection.    ,NCT00001086
HIV,The Effectiveness of Nelfinavir and Efavirenz Used Alone or Together Combined With Other Anti-HIV Drugs in Patients Who Have Taken Anti-HIV Drugs, Steps I and II: The purpose of this study is the following: To look at how many patients achieve undetectable HIV blood levels at Week 16. To look at the absolute change in HIV blood levels from the beginning of the study to Week 16. To look at the safety and tolerability of nelfinavir (NFV) and efavirenz (EFV) when used in combination or separately in regimens containing reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs). For the 2 extension studies (Weeks 49 to 144): To look at the proportion of patients whose long-term viral load remains undetectable at Week 96. To look at the time from the beginning of the study to treatment failure with patients evaluated through Week 144. Step III: To look at the proportion of patients whose HIV blood levels are undetectable 16 weeks after starting the salvage study treatment. To assess safety toxicity and tolerance of salvage study drug treatment. (This study has been changed by adding new objectives.) Achieving viral suppression has been widely endorsed as the primary goal of HIV therapy. However there are few established guidelines for devising combinations of different classes of drugs which will enhance the potential for achieving viral suppression reducing the risk of toxicity and preserving therapeutic options for future use. This study includes 2 anti-HIV drugs NFV (a protease inhibitor [PI]) and EFV (a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]) for use either alone or in combination with RTI therapy for the purpose of limiting HIV replication. Patients with treatment failure at Week 16 choose 1 of the following 3 alternative salvage therapies: 2-drug PI regimen (saquinavir and ritonavir) plus adefovir dipivoxil and L-carnitine; EFV or NFV (if not already given) plus 2 new approved anti-HIV drugs outside the study; or the best available treatment outside the study. The new RTI adefovir dipivoxil is added to the 2-drug PI regimen to achieve suppression of viral replication and thereby delay disease progression. (This rationale reflects a change in the treatment given to patients with treatment failure at Week 16.)    ,NCT00001087
HIV,A Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of the Facilitated HIV-1 Gag-Pol DNA Vaccine (APL-400-047 Apollon Inc.) Given Intramuscularly by Needle and Syringe or Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Jet Injection System in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Volunteers, To evaluate the safety tolerability and immunogenicity in humans of the APL-400-047 vaccine when administered intramuscularly by needle and syringe at 1 of 3 doses or by Biojector at the intermediate dose. [AS PER AMENDMENT 07/98: To evaluate the tolerability safety and immunogenicity of an increased dose in an additional group of volunteers.] DNA-based immunization mimics live-attenuated virus vaccination by stimulation of both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system; thus potentially providing the advantages of a live virus vaccination but without the potential risks. It is essential that novel vaccine strategies (including DNA-based immunizations) continue to be developed and enter Phase I human testing because to date no candidate vaccine from any of the approximately 30 AVEG Phase I or II trials has progressed to a Phase III efficacy trial. Use of a Biojector jet gun for vaccine delivery may also have potential psychological comfort safety and immunologic advantages over the traditional needle and syringe method of delivery.    ,NCT00001088
HIV,A Multicenter Randomized Placebo-Controlled Double-Blinded Phase I Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Live Recombinant Canarypox ALVAC-HIV vCP205 Combined With GM-CSF in Healthy HIV-1 Uninfected Volunteers, To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of live recombinant canarypox ALVAC-HIV vCP205 in combination with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) at 80 microg and 250 microg. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/30/99: To study the safety of following 4 ALVAC immunizations with a nucleic acid gag/pol HIV-1 immunogen (APL-400-047 Wyeth-Lederle). To assess the ability of this sequence of immunization to boost the LTL T-helper cell and antibody response.] ALVAC-HIV candidate vaccines have induced HIV-specific CTL responses in more than half of recipients in some protocols. Depending on the HIV-1 gene products expressed by the particular ALVAC-HIV candidate vaccine volunteers have generated anti-Envelope (vCP125 vCP205 and vCP300) anti-Gag (vCP205 and vCP300) and anti-Nef (vCP300) CTL activity. Although 3 to 4 immunizations with the different ALVAC-HIV experimental vaccines induce anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies in a portion often the majority of volunteers the geometric mean titers of these antibodies are modest usually less than 50. This study will determine whether there is an increase in the anti-HIV antibody titers when GM-CSF is used as an adjuvant with ALVAC-HIV vCP205 and will also examine the kinetics and magnitude of the HIV-specific CTL response.    ,NCT00001090
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Four Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Children and Teens, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give HIV-infected children and teens 1 of 4 anti-HIV drug combinations. Decreasing HIV levels in infected patients can slow down disease progression. Further study is needed to find out which drug combinations are most effective in doing this.    ,NCT00001091
HIV,The Biology of HIV Transmission, The purpose of this study is to look at the amount of HIV in the blood genital fluid and saliva of the partners of patients with early HIV infection. This study will also look at the strength of the immune systems of patients with early HIV infection. Because HIV multiplies very quickly in the early stages of infection patients with early HIV infection may be more likely to transmit HIV to their partners. The amount of HIV in blood genital fluid and saliva may determine the risk for transmission.    ,NCT00001092
HIV,Outcomes of Anti-HIV Therapy During Early HIV Infection, The purpose of this study is to find out if it is effective to give aggressive anti-HIV therapy to patients who have been infected recently with HIV. Many doctors recommend that patients who have recently been infected with HIV begin anti-HIV treatment as soon as possible. However early HIV infection is not yet completely understood so it is not known if this is the best approach. This study will look at the effects of beginning anti-HIV treatment during early HIV infection.    ,NCT00001093
HIV,A Comparison of Nelfinavir Plus Saquinavir Plus Delavirdine or 3TC/ZDV Versus Nelfinavir Plus 3TC/ZDV in HIV-Infected Patients, To compare the long-term virologic response to combination therapy with two protease inhibitors i.e. nelfinavir (NFV) + saquinavir soft gel capsule (SQVsgc) and delavirdine (DLV) or combination lamivudine/zidovudine (3TC/ZDV Combivir) versus NFV and 3TC/ZDV in the proportion of patients demonstrating virologic success (< 500 copies/ml HIV RNA) at week 48 without prior virologic or clinical failure. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of combination protease inhibitors. To evaluate the durability of virologic response as assessed by the Roche Ultra Sensitive assay (< 200 copies/ml) and culturable virus. To compare time to a confirmed virologic response (two consecutive plasma HIV RNA levels < 500 copies/ml) or to a confirmed treatment relapse following a confirmed virologic response across the treatment arms. To evaluate biologic phenotype (non-syncytium inducing versus syncytium inducing capacity) and the evolution and patterns of viral resistance among patients with confirmed treatment failures at or after weeks 16 to 24. To compare immunologic benefits as measured by longitudinal CD4/CD8 cell count profiles. To evaluate the influence of baseline virologic and immunologic parameters on the magnitude and duration of plasma HIV RNA response. To compare virologic response between the two dose schedules of NFV and SQVsgc (bid vs tid) and between NFV and SQVsgc with either DLV or combination 3TC/ZDV. To evaluate compliance and exploratory population pharmacometrics. Past studies have shown that combination therapies not only will result in better clinical outcomes but may prolong the effects of therapy. The enhanced effects seen with combination therapies are likely related to a greater suppression of HIV replication and alterations in resistance patterns. Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that triple-drug therapy may have an advantage over one- and two-drug regimens. Therefore triple-drug therapy appears to be an important strategy in the treatment of HIV infection.    ,NCT00001094
HIV,A Study of Three Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in Patients Who Have Taken Amprenavir," To determine the proportion of patients treated with amprenavir zidovudine (ZDV) stavudine (D4T) and lamivudine (3TC) whose HIV-1 RNA level remains below the level of detection during 96 weeks of therapy. To determine the proportion of patients treated with indinavir (IDV) nevirapine (NVP) 3TC and d4T whose HIV-1 RNA level decreases and then remains below the level of detection during the 96-week therapy period. To determine the viral effects safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics of amprenavir in combination with zidovudine stavudine and lamivudine.

HIV,A Phase I Multicenter Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of HIV-1 MN rsgp120 and Bivalent AIDSVAX B/E (HIV-1 MN rgp120/A244 rgp120) in Combination With QS-21 With or Without Alum in Healthy HIV-1 Uninfected Adults, To assess the safety and immune response to two experimental vaccines when formulated with QS-21 or QS-21 plus alum. To determine whether the new preparation of QS-21 in polysorbate 80 is less reactogenic than the QS-21 formulation used in AVEG Protocols 016 016A and 016B. To examine whether QS-21 is immunologically equivalent to that used in 16B. To determine if QS-21 when given with low doses of antigen induces measurable HIV-1-specific CTL activity. To evaluate if the QS-21 dose-sparing effect extends to an antigen dose of 0.5 micrograms. To determine if the bivalent vaccine gives responses equivalent to the monovalent product or if a broadening of the HIV-1-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses occurs. An effective vaccine to prevent HIV-1 infection may need to generate diverse and multifaceted immunologic responses. Required parts of the immune response may include: humoral antibodies which broadly neutralize non-syncytium-inducing strains of HIV-1; T cell help provided by both CD4 and CD8 positive subsets; and a class I-restricted cytotoxic lymphocyte response. Other effector responses such as the generation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity cytokines chemokines or other antiviral factors may also be critical in mounting protective immunity. Given the lack of a surrogate immunologic marker the most practical approach for possible efficacy trials would be to evaluate a candidate vaccine that elicits as many of these responses as possible.    ,NCT00001096
HIV,Long-Term Effects of HAART in Youth With Stronger Immune Systems Versus Youth With Weaker Immune Systems, The purpose of this study is to see if children and young adults with better immune systems before starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) do better than those who have weaker immune systems before starting HAART. HIV infection weakens the immune system's ability to fight other infections and diseases. HAART is a type of anti-HIV therapy shown to improve the immune system of adults. However not all patients show the same amount of improvement with HAART. Doctors believe that results may depend on how strong a patient's immune system is before starting HAART. Long-term effects of HAART in children and young adults have not yet been studied.    ,NCT00001097
HIV,The Effect of Anti-HIV Therapy on Fat Metabolism in HIV-Positive Patients, The purpose of this study is to see how taking certain anti-HIV drugs affects the way the body metabolizes fat. This study will evaluate patients who are enrolled in CPCRA 058 (the FIRST [Flexible Initial Retrovirus Suppressive Therapies] study) by looking for changes in cholesterol levels levels of fat in the blood and body fat distribution. Patients in the FIRST study receive an anti-HIV drug regimen which contains a protease inhibitor (PI) a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or both. Anti-HIV drug therapy using PIs has become very common treatment for HIV-positive patients. Recently however serious side effects involving how the body uses fat are being reported in patients taking PIs. Examples of these side effects are a redistribution of body fat high cholesterol level and development of diabetes. However some of these side effects have also been seen in patients who are not taking PIs. It is important to determine whether or not these side effects are directly related to PI use. In this study patients on different drug combinations either with or without a PI will be compared.    ,NCT00001102
HIV,A Study of Zidovudine in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Hemophilia, Study A: To determine whether treatment with zidovudine (ZDV) will delay or change the disease process in hemophilic patients who have HIV infection with no symptoms. The major clinical question is whether patients who receive chronic ZDV therapy will have a delay in the development of AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). The pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of ZDV in hemophilic patients will also be studied. Study B: To determine if ZDV therapy changes the risk of a hemophiliac transmitting HIV to his wife or other female sexual partner. To determine the effectiveness of counseling and education on the behaviors of the wives that place them at risk for HIV infection. To determine if antibodies to HIV either appear or disappear from the blood of any of the wives during the study. Study A: Individuals who are infected with HIV can benefit from therapy with an effective anti-AIDS virus agent. ZDV is a potent inhibitor of HIV in vitro (test tube) and is safe in humans at the dose planned. It may be effective in preventing the development of AIDS or ARC in hemophiliacs who have the HIV antibody in their blood. The pharmacokinetic studies are especially important because the high prevalence of hepatic disease in this population may affect the metabolism and blood levels of ZDV. Study B: HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and wives of infected hemophilic patients have become infected during long-term sexual relationships. Transmission of the virus does not occur during casual family contact. This study will aid in determining if therapy influences the transmission of HIV because the wives of hemophiliacs generally have no risk for HIV infection other than sexual contact with their spouse.    ,NCT00001104
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of Human Monoclonal Antibody F105 in the Treatment of HIV, To determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of F105 human monoclonal antibody both following a single dose and during intermittent administration in HIV-infected patients. To determine specific dose concentrations sufficient to achieve efficacy and avoid toxicity. To determine the effect of F105 on virologic immunologic and serologic parameters. Early in the course of HIV infection the primary humoral immune response appears to be highly strain specific and to be directed at a hypervariable portion of the viral gp120. The F105 human monoclonal antibody reacts with the CD4 binding region of gp120 and has been shown to neutralize the IIIB SF2 and MN strains of HIV at concentrations readily achievable in humans.    ,NCT00001105
HIV,A Study of Zidovudine in HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and Their Children, AMENDED: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered AZT to HIV-1 infected pregnant women in labor; to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion of AZT and its metabolites in newborns of HIV-1 infected mothers who receive IV AZT only during labor; to evaluate the safety of IV AZT administered by continuous infusion to HIV-1 infected laboring women and their infants. Original design: To determine the distribution and elimination of zidovudine (AZT) in the body as well as its safety in the treatment of pregnant women and their unborn children. The information derived from this study is required in order to design a future study that will assess the efficacy of AZT in reducing the transmission rate of HIV-1 from seropositive women to their fetus by treating them during the third trimester of pregnancy. An estimated 30 percent to 40 percent infected pregnant women risk transmission of HIV-1 to their infants whether they be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Zidovudine (AZT) has previously demonstrated its effectiveness as a potent inhibitor of HIV replication in vitro and in adult patients; benefits of treatment include decreased mortality rate decreased incidence of opportunistic infections and increased number of CD4 cells. Phase I AZT studies in children however have resulted in uncontrolled information regarding clinical efficacy. The present study therefore will investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) and oral AZT administration to HIV-1 infected pregnant women in the 3rd trimester as well as the safety and efficacy of such treatment in their newborns. It is hoped that the results will be instrumental in designing future studies to assess the efficacy of AZT in reducing the transmission risk of HIV-1.    ,NCT00001106
HIV,A Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of Treating Advanced AIDS Patients Between Ages 4 and 22 With 7 Drugs Some at Higher Than Usual Doses, The purpose of this study is to see if 7 drugs some of them given at higher doses than normal are safe and tolerated by young patients with AIDS who have failed to respond to other treatments. The study will also see what effect taking several anti-HIV drugs together at high doses has on the body's ability to fight HIV infection. The 7 drugs that will be given in this study are stavudine (d4T) didanosine (ddI) lamivudine (3TC) nelfinavir (NFV) ritonavir (RTV) saquinavir (SQV) and nevirapine (NVP). (This study has been changed from an 8-drug regimen to a 7-drug regimen. Patients no longer receive the drug hydroxyurea [HU].) Doctors are seeing many HIV-positive children who did not get good long-term results from the current anti-HIV drugs. Some doctors believe anti-HIV drugs fail because drug levels in the body are too low. In this study doctors will give patients 7 drugs some at higher doses than normal. Since it is very important that patients on the study take all of these drugs doctors will make it as easy as possible. Doctors want to try this because children with advanced AIDS have few treatment choices.    ,NCT00001108
HIV,A Blood Test to Look at Cells of the Immune System in Healthy Children, The purpose of this study is to learn more about some of the immune cells in the blood (CD4 cells for example) of healthy children in order to better understand the differences in the blood cells of children infected with HIV. Because children's bodies are still developing their cells are different from those of adults and their bodies respond differently to infections such as HIV. In order to understand how immune cells grow and mature so that they can fight HIV it is important to see how these cells behave in normal children.    ,NCT00001109
HIV,Effect of Anti-HIV Therapy (HAART) on HIV Levels in the Lungs and on Lung Cell Inflammation in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to see: (1) how the amount of HIV in the lungs compares to that in the blood; (2) if HAART reduces the amount of HIV in the lungs; and (3) if HAART reduces lung inflammation in HIV-infected patients. Lung-cell inflammation in HIV-infected patients is probably caused by HIV infection of these cells. The amount of inflammation may correspond to the amount of HIV (viral load) in the lungs (i.e. mild inflammation indicates a low amount of HIV; severe inflammation indicates a high amount of HIV). HAART is used to decrease the amount of HIV in the body. If HAART is able to decrease viral load in the lungs it should also be able to decrease lung-cell inflammation in these patients.    ,NCT00001110
HIV,A Study of Nevirapine Used Alone or in Combination With AZT in HIV-1-Infected Children, Monotherapy phase: To evaluate and compare the safety tolerance pharmacokinetics and preliminary activity of nevirapine administered alone in mildly to moderately symptomatic HIV-infected children ages 2 months to less than 18 years; to evaluate and compare the safety tolerance and pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in HIV-infected children ages 1 day to less than 2 months. Combination therapy phase: To evaluate and compare the safety tolerance pharmacokinetics and preliminary activity of nevirapine administered in combination with zidovudine (AZT) in mildly to moderately symptomatic HIV-infected children ages 2 months to less than 18 years. Compounds with reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity that are more potent and less toxic than the nucleoside analogues are needed. Nevirapine (BI-RG-587) has shown in vitro inhibitory activity against HIV-1reverse transcriptase and has shown a synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 replication when combined with zidovudine (AZT) in a plaque reduction assay.    ,NCT00001111
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of Injections of Human Recombinant Interferon-gamma in Patients With AIDS Who Have Taken Zidovudine, To find out which of four doses of (recombinant) human interferon gamma (IFN-G) is most effective in stimulating the white blood cells (monocytes) to fight infection and to see if treatment with IFN-G can strengthen the ability of AIDS patients to control infections. This study will also determine how long after a single injection of IFN-G white blood cells remain stimulated. AIDS is a disease that progressively destroys that aspect of the body's defense called the immune system. It is particularly harmful to a class of cells called helper T-lymphocytes. The specific opportunistic infections and malignancies associated with AIDS have been treated with therapies that are often poorly tolerated by the patients and are associated with dose-limiting toxicities. The principal focus of AIDS therapy research at present is to control the underlying retroviral infection and to restore immune function with recombinant lymphokines adoptive immunotherapy and/or lymphocyte transplants. These treatments include zidovudine (AZT) which has been shown to control the HIV infection and IFN-G a lymphokine which activates tumor-destroying and germ-killing functions. Studies are needed to find the dose by which IFN-G works best.    ,NCT00001112
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Ability of TNFR:Fc to Decrease the Amount of IL-6 (Interleukin-6) and TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor) in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to determine if TNFR:Fc (a molecule that attaches to TNF) can lower the amount of IL-6 in HIV-positive patients. This study will also examine the effect of TNFR:Fc on TNF-alpha. IL-6 and TNF-alpha are 2 substances produced by the immune system that may increase the rate of HIV replication. IL-6 and TNF-alpha are produced naturally by the body. High levels of TNF-alpha lead to increased IL-6 production and increased HIV replication therefore helping the virus infect the body. HIV-positive patients who receive IL-2 (interleukin-2 a protein that helps the immune system fight infection) tend to have higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha than patients not receiving IL-2. These increased levels may contribute to some of the flu-like symptoms related to IL-2 administration. TNFR:Fc can neutralize TNF-alpha to decrease the action of TNF-alpha and in turn decrease the amount of IL-6 in the body. TNFR:Fc may therefore have a role in the treatment of HIV disease or in relieving some of the symptoms related to IL-2 administration.    ,NCT00001116
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-Positive Patients Who Also Have Hepatitis C Infection, This study evaluates patients infected with both HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) who are receiving anti-HIV drugs.

HIV,Study of a New Anti-HIV Drug T-20 in HIV-Infected Children, The purpose of this study is to determine the best dose of T-20 a new anti-HIV drug to treat HIV-infected children. T-20 unlike other anti-HIV medications lessens the ability of HIV to infect certain cells (T cells) in the body. Doctors hope to better treat HIV by adding T-20 to anti-HIV drug combinations that include 1 or 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and/or a protease inhibitor (PI).    ,NCT00001118
HIV,Effects on the Immune System of Anti-HIV Drugs in Patients Recently Infected With HIV, The purpose of this study is to find out whether these powerful combinations of anti-HIV drugs are safe and effective for use in patients in the early stages of HIV infection and to find out how patients' immune systems react to HIV and anti-HIV drugs. Doctors generally treat patients in the early stages of HIV infection with the same anti-HIV drugs taken by patients who have had HIV for a long time. These drugs lower the level of HIV in the blood. However doctors do not know whether patients who take anti-HIV drugs in the early stages of HIV infection actually live longer or have fewer AIDS-related diseases. This study will help doctors answer these questions. In the main study doctors will look at how 2 different anti-HIV drug combinations affect the immune system. In the 2 substudies doctors will look at how the body reacts to the hepatitis B vaccine and the tetanus vaccine. These substudies may help doctors learn how HIV-infected patients respond to new infections.    ,NCT00001119
HIV,A Study to Monitor the Health of Participants in HIVNET 014 Who Become Infected With HIV-1, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term consequences of HIV-1 infections that occurred in association with known but discouraged high-risk behaviors in persons who have received HIV candidate vaccines or placebo in HIVNET 014. Doctors need to look at how these patients respond to HIV infection in order to develop new HIV vaccines and other treatments for HIV and AIDS. Patients who receive HIV vaccines are sometimes protected from HIV infection. More often these patients become HIV-positive but experience a boost in their immune system that helps their bodies fight HIV. Doctors need to look at how these patients respond to HIV infection in order to develop new HIV vaccines and other treatments for HIV and AIDS.    ,NCT00001121
HIV,A Study of an Adherence Plan to Help HIV-Positive Patients Take Their First Anti-HIV Medications Correctly," The purpose of this study is to see if observed therapy can help HIV-positive patients stick to their anti-HIV medication schedule. Observed therapy means that a nurse will watch patients take their medications to make sure that they take them correctly. It is very important that HIV-positive patients take their anti-HIV medications correctly so they get the best possible benefit from them. Taking the drugs correctly called ""adherence"" may keep HIV virus levels in the blood (viral load) low for a longer time. Adherence can also slow the development of drug resistance and this is especially important in patients with early HIV infection who are just beginning treatment. However anti-HIV medication schedules are often complicated and many patients have difficulty remembering to take their drugs at the correct time. This study will look at the effectiveness of a plan to help patients with this problem.    ",NCT00001122
HIV,Use of a Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) Vaccine to Prevent Shingles in HIV-Infected Children Who Have Already Had Chickenpox, The purpose of this study is to see if the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine will be safe and if it can help prevent shingles in HIV-infected children who have already had chickenpox. VZV is the virus that causes chickenpox. If this virus is reactivated in the body it can also cause shingles. Shingles is common in children with HIV who have had chickenpox although it is usually not life-threatening. The VZV vaccine used in this study may be able to prevent HIV-positive children who have had chickenpox from developing shingles.    ,NCT00001125
HIV,A Study of Two Adherence Plans to Help HIV-Positive Patients Take Their Medications Correctly," The purpose of this study is to look at different ways to help patients follow their anti-HIV medication schedules. It is very important that HIV-positive patients take their anti-HIV medications correctly so they get the best possible benefit from them. Taking the drugs correctly called ""adherence"" may keep HIV virus levels in the blood (viral load) low for a longer time. However anti-HIV medication schedules are often complicated and many patients have difficulty remembering to take their drugs at the correct time. This study will look at 2 different ways to teach patients about the importance of taking their medications correctly and to remind them when to take their medications.    ",NCT00001129
HIV,Identifying Emergency Room Patients Who Have Recently Been Infected With HIV, The purpose of this study is to identify patients who have early HIV infection. Patients who have been infected with HIV recently may develop flu-like symptoms within 3 to 8 weeks. Those who go to the hospital emergency room for these symptoms and who may have been exposed to HIV recently will be given a questionnaire and the opportunity to be tested for HIV. Most people develop flu-like symptoms shortly after becoming infected with HIV and many of these people go to a hospital emergency room for treatment. However most doctors do not think of testing people with flu-like symptoms for HIV. This study will look at a plan to change this because it is very important to identify patients who have early HIV infection. Viral load (level of HIV in the blood) is very high during early HIV infection and it is easy to spread HIV to others during this period. Patients who learn they are HIV-positive can stop risky behavior that might spread HIV to other people. Also patients who find out early that they are HIV positive are able to begin anti-HIV treatment sooner slowing the disease.    ,NCT00001130
HIV,Effectiveness of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) Plus Anti-HIV Therapy in HIV-Positive Patients, The purpose of this study is to find out if the immune systems of HIV-positive patients can be improved by treatment with anti-HIV medications plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the early stages of HIV infection. IL-2 is a protein found naturally in the blood that can help boost the immune system. HIV spreads throughout the body by invading CD4 cells which are cells of the immune system that fight infection. Doctors hope that adding IL-2 to a current anti-HIV drug combination can help restore the CD4 cell count and the immune functions. This study will look at how the HIV virus acts during the early stages of HIV infection how the immune system responds to HIV and what impact early treatment with anti-HIV medications has on the course of HIV infection.    ,NCT00001131
HIV,Effectiveness of the Early Addition of Abacavir to an Anti-HIV Drug Combination, The purpose of this study is to see if adding 1 drug to an anti-HIV drug combination early in treatment against HIV can lower the viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) to a level so low that it cannot be measured (undetectable). The drug that will be added to a treatment is abacavir (ABC). Many patients who take 3 anti-HIV drugs together are able to achieve very low viral loads for example viral loads below 50 copies/ml. However some patients taking only 3 drugs are not able to achieve a viral load this low. Doctors hope that by adding the drug ABC to a current treatment a viral load below 50 copies/ml can be achieved. Doctors would like to find out if it is effective to start patients on 3 drugs and then add another drug (treatment intensification) if the treatment is not working as well as hoped.    ,NCT00001132
HIV,Safety and Tolerance of Indinavir Plus Ritonavir in HIV-Positive Patients Failing Therapy With Amprenavir Nelfinavir or Saquinavir, In this study the protease inhibitors indinavir (IDV) and ritonavir (RTV) will be studied in patients who have high levels of virus while taking other protease inhibitors. The purpose of this study is to see how the body takes in distributes and gets rid of IDV and RTV. This study will also look at any side effects that IDV or RTV causes. IDV is an effective anti-HIV drug but it can be difficult for patients to take. For IDV to work against HIV it must be taken 3 times a day at a high dose and with a certain diet. Doctors believe IDV may be easier to take if it is given with RTV. Patients who take IDV and RTV together may be able to take IDV only twice a day and at a lower dose. This study will gather information about the safety and side effects of using IDV and RTV together.    ,NCT00001133
HIV,A Study of Nevirapine to Prevent HIV Transmission From Mothers to Their Infants, The purpose of this study is to see if giving the anti-HIV drug nevirapine (NVP) to HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants can help reduce the chance that a mother will give HIV to her baby during delivery. NVP is a promising medication for blocking HIV transmission from HIV-positive mothers to their infants. NVP is inexpensive and is easily absorbed by the mother and transferred to the infant. It is thought that even a single dose to the mother and infant may provide enough protection to the baby during the time of exposure to HIV at birth.    ,NCT00001135
HIV,A Study of the Effectiveness of an HIV Vaccine (ALVAC vCP205) to Boost Immune Functions in HIV-Negative Volunteers Who Have Already Received an HIV Vaccine, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give an HIV vaccine (vCP205) to volunteers who received an HIV vaccine at least 2 years ago and to study how the immune system responds to this vaccine. Vaccines are given to people to try to resist infection or prevent disease. There are a number of different HIV vaccines that are currently being tested. The vaccines that seem to be the most promising are canarypox vaccines known as ALVAC vaccines; the vaccine tested in this study is ALVAC-HIV vCP205. This study will look at the safety of the vaccine and how the immune system responds to it.    ,NCT00001136
HIV,Long-Term Data Collection From Participants in Adult AIDS Clinical Trials, The purpose of this study is to determine what combinations of anti-HIV drugs work best in patients treated over several years. The study will also assess the occurrence of side effects and opportunistic infections in patients with low viral loads compared to those with higher viral loads.    ,NCT00001137
HIV,Metabolism and Body Shape of Healthy Children and Children With Chronic Infections, Some HIV-infected adults develop lipodystrophy that includes significant changes in body shape with fat losses in the face arms and legs and fat gain in the trunk. This lipodystrophy is often accompanied by other disorders of metabolism such as increased levels of fat and insulin in the blood. The majority of these cases have been seen when patients are taking medications called protease inhibitors. These are anti-retroviral medications designed to treat patients with HIV. It is unclear if lipodystrophy is a result of having HIV or the medication used to treat HIV. It has been suggested but not proven that lipodystrophy is a direct side effect of protease inhibitors. In addition it is unknown if HIV-infected children develop significant lipodystrophy after taking protease inhibitors. This study will investigate the prevalence of metabolic disorders and changes in body fat distribution in children taking protease inhibitor anti-retroviral medications. The results will be compared to three other groups; (1) children suffering from other non-HIV chronic infections (2) HIV-infected children not taking protease inhibitors and (3) healthy children. The study will look at HIV-infected children who have already started taking protease inhibitors. It will evaluate these children for disorders in metabolism as well as body fat changes. In addition the study will follow HIV-infected children who will begin taking protease inhibitors. The study will follow these children for 18 months to detect the development of disorders in metabolism and / or body fat changes.    ,NCT00001142
HIV,Prediction and Testing of Antigenic Sites of the AIDS Virus HTLV-III Recognized by T Lymphocytes for the Development of Synthetic Vaccines, Subjects are healthy adult volunteers either at high risk for HIV infection or already known to be seropositive who will donate blood for in vitro tests of T-cell function and in vitro responses to synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences from HIV proteins.    ,NCT00001210
HIV,A Pilot Study of the Combination of Retinoic Acid and Interferon-Alpha2a for the Treatment of Lymphoproliferative Disorders in Children With Immunodeficiency Syndromes, Patients with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies are at an increased risk to develop polyclonal or oligoclonal lymphoid malignancies. Some develop a lymphoproliferative disorder that can follow a clinically aggressive course and may represent a pre-malignant lesion. Although most of these lymphoproliferative disorders are of B-cell origin T-cell or non-B-non-T-cell processes have also been observed. The pathogenesis is only partially understood. In the case of pre-malignant conditions it is often difficult to know when and whether a therapeutic intervention is necessary and a careful consideration of potential treatment-associated morbidity is indicated. Therapies have ranged from influencing the possible infectious etiology (by treating with acyclovir) decreasing the amount of immunosuppression (in transplant patients) to the use of immunomodulatory agents including interferons and interleukins. Recent data have indicated that the use of differentiating agents such as the retinoids might offer yet another treatment option. In the current study we will try to get a better understanding of the pathogenesis and natural course of lymphoproliferative disorders in immunodeficient children. The study will have two parts: an initial observation period to obtain information on the natural course of these disorders and then a six month treatment period with the combination of a differentiating agent (13-cis-retinoic acid was used until all-trans-retinoic acid became available on 7/96) with an immunomodulatory agent (interferon-alpha2a IFN-alpha2a).    ,NCT00001438
HIV,The Use of Bacteriophage Phi X174 to Assess the Immune Competence of HIV-Infected Patients In Vivo, The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and utility of bacteriophage phi X174 immunization as a tool to assess the immune competence of HIV-infected patients at different stages of disease in vivo and to assess the impact of viral load levels and therapy-induced changes in viral load levels on the response to immunization with the neo-antigen bacteriophage phi X174. Bacteriophage phi X174 immunization is a method that has been in use for more than 25 years to assess the immunity of patients with various types of primary and secondary immunodeficiencies including 48 HIV-infected patients. This is a prospective open-label controlled study which will enroll 39 HIV-infected patients and 13 healthy volunteers male or female with 18 years of age and over. The HIV-infected patients will be divided into 3 groups according to their CD4 cell count: less than 200 cells/mm(3) between 200 and 500 cells/mm(3) and greater than 500 cells/mm(3). After screening and a two week pre-study evaluation all eligible participants will receive a primary secondary and tertiary immunization with 2 x 10(9) PFU/kg of bacteriophage phi X174 six weeks apart. Patients who present with detectable levels of viral load at entry will be offered a more effective antiviral drug regimen. Patients will have to be on a stable antiviral regimen for at least one month prior to receiving the primary immunization. Patients will return for visits 1 2 and 4 weeks after each immunization for clinical and laboratory evaluations. The study endpoints are: safety (as measured by incidence of adverse events CD4 cell count and HIV plasma RNA) kinetics of bacteriophage clearance following primary immunization quantitation of bacteriophage phi X174 specific antibody titers following primary secondary and tertiary immunizations and determination of qualitative and quantitative antibody isotype switching following secondary and tertiary immunizations.    ,NCT00001540
HIV,A Pilot Study of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Chemotherapy and Blood Levels of Organochlorines, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is the third most rapidly increasing cancer in the United States. HIV-related NHL is responsible for some of the increase since the early 1980s. However it cannot explain the steady increase in the incidence rates in earlier years nor the entire increase shown recently. A possible role of environmental exposures is receiving attention. One possibility is that exposure to organochlorines (OCs) may be related to the occurrence of NHL. NCI is currently designing a large population-based case-control study to investigate this hypothesis further by analyzing OC levels in blood collected at the time of interview from cases of NHL and their matched controls. At the time of these interviews cases in the main case-control study would most likely have already received chemotherapy. If chemotherapy changes the blood levels of OCs this may lead to misclassification of exposure among cases and eventually to biased risk estimates. The purpose of this pilot study is to estimate the bias due to measuring the serum levels of OCs in cases during or after chemotherapy. Twenty newly diagnosed patients will be recruited for the study. From each patient four consecutive blood samples one prior to two during and one after chemotherapy will be collected. Forty pairs of pre-existing cryopreserved serum samples (pre- and post-treatment) taken from the NHL patients who participated in an earlier NCI clinical study will also be included in this study. Samples will be assayed for OC levels. The results will be used to plan and to interpret another large case-control study (the main study).    ,NCT00001571
HIV,Determination of HIV-1 Production by the Prostate, Virus present in semen likely contributes substantially to the sexual transmission of HIV. However the source of HIV in semen is unknown. Some evidence suggests that the prostate may be the source of at least some of the virus in semen. This study is designed to determine whether the prostate may serve as the source of virus in semen by comparing the concentration of HIV-1 RNA in semen donated normally in semen obtained following prostatic massage and in expressed prostatic secretions. Finding a source for semen HIV would provide important insights into several aspects of HIV sexual transmission. Since some drugs do not enter the prostate well the finding that virus is produced in the prostate might suggest the prostate could serve as a reservoir for HIV leading to the development of resistance to antiviral agents.    ,NCT00001584
HIV,A Pilot Study of the Patterns of Cellular Gene Expression in HIV-1 Patients Following Clinical Events Which Increase Plasma Virus Concentrations, The factors that influence HIV disease progression are not well understood. While larger amounts of circulating virus (high 'viral loads') predict future adverse clinical events many of the clinical factors responsible for high viral loads and disease progression remain unknown. Certain clinical events and defined interventions are associated with increases in plasma viral RNA concentrations. One of these clinical interventions is immunization; immunization with several vaccines have been shown to increase plasma HIV RNA concentrations. Even though vaccination can lead to transient increases in plasma HIV concentrations certain vaccines including influenza vaccine are still recommended for HIV patients because the risks of the disease targeted by the immunization are held to be greater than the immunization itself. Therefore immunization with influenza vaccine can be considered a model clinically indicated intervention given at a known time which stimulates HIV replication. For influenza immunization and for other treatments leading to increases in viral RNA concentrations is not available. We hypothesize that immunization with influenza vaccine and perhaps other immune stimulatory events lead to an increase in HIV replication through a regulatory system involving cytokines signal transduction systems transcription factors effects on the cell cycle and increased expression of additional gene products needed for viral replication such as genes of the nucleic acid biosynthetic pathways. While experiments aimed at investigating one or another particular part of this regulatory system can be performed with traditionally available technologies such technologies cannot provide comprehensive information concerning a large number of the regulatory events that may be involved in mediating the increase in HIV RNA concentration. In this protocol we aim to develop the methodologies needed to determine changes in expression of many of the genes which may be involved in mediating the regulation of HIV expression in HIV-infected patients using cDNA microarray technologies. Once the methodologies are developed such work may provide new insights into the regulatory systems controlling HIV expression in HIV-infected patients may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HIV disease.    ,NCT00001681
HIV,Influences on HIV Infected Subjects' Willingness to Participate in Research and Ability to Give Informed Consent, This protocol seeks to better understand the various factors which influence an HIV infected individual's decision to participate in clinical research and especially how the offer of payment influences the decision to participate and understanding of the risks benefits and purpose of the research. Subjects will be HIV infected individuals participating in or being screened for participation in intramural HIV studies being conducted by the NIAID CCMD and NCI. Willing subjects will be recruited from studies that offer payment and comparable studies that do not pay. The primary methodology is an interview via a survey schedule. Use of the interview schedule will be preceded by a focus group of about 7-10 individuals and pretesting of the survey instrument. Paid and unpaid subjects will be compared with respect to motivations understanding willingness to withdraw and sociodemographics.    ,NCT00001717

HIV,An Oral Dose-Ranging Finding Study in Patients With HIV Disease CDC Classification Groups IIB III and IV-C2, To establish the relationship between the oral dose of zidovudine (AZT) and its hematologic toxicity. AZT has preliminarily been shown to decrease significant events and death in a group of AIDS / Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and AIDS related complex (ARC) patients followed at this time for a limited period. If these data withstand further follow-up it appears that AZT is a potential antiretroviral agent that may have application in the use of all stages of HIV disease. At this time the optimal dose that will not cause significant toxicity is not known. If this drug has widespread application it becomes imperative to further study both the dose and the toxicity. Patients with documented HIV viremia and who are well will be evaluated in a dose-escalating protocol for toxicity persistent viremia evidence of improvement of immune dysfunction and the development of further manifestation of HIV disease. Drug levels will be monitored and correlated with the toxicity and viremia.    ,NCT00002023

This study also examines how the body handles this combination of anti-HIV drugs.    ,NCT00004580
HIV,A Study to Compare Two Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Previously Received Anti-HIV Treatment, The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of 2 anti-HIV drug combinations in HIV-infected patients. Both combinations will include nevirapine (NVP) 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and at least 1 protease inhibitor (PI). One combination will include a new protease inhibitor ABT-378 combined in a capsule with ritonavir (RTV).    ,NCT00004581
HIV,ABT-378/Ritonavir and Efavirenz in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Taken More Than One Protease Inhibitor in the Past, The purpose of this study is to see if ABT-378/ritonavir plus efavirenz is safe and effective in lowering the amount of HIV in the blood of patients who have been treated with more than 1 protease inhibitor (PI).    ,NCT00004582
HIV,A Phase III Study Comparing Two Different Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Positive Patients Without Previous Anti-HIV Drug Therapy, The purpose of this study is to see how safe a new protease inhibitor (PI) is and how well it fights HIV infection. A PI is a drug that stops HIV from using healthy cells to make more virus. This study will compare the new PI combination of ABT-378 plus ritonavir (RTV) with another PI nelfinavir (NFV). Earlier studies suggest ABT-378/RTV will be just as good as and perhaps better than NFV at fighting HIV infection.    ,NCT00004583
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of a New Protease Inhibitor BMS-232632 in HIV-Positive Patients Who Have Received Previous Treatment, The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and effectiveness of an experimental protease inhibitor (a type of anti-HIV drug) called BMS-232632. Doctors will compare an anti-HIV drug combination that includes BMS-232632 to a drug combination that includes ritonavir.    ,NCT00004584
HIV,A Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of Combination Anti-HIV Therapy in HIV-Infected Adults, The purpose of this study is to see if a certain combination of anti-HIV drugs is safe and effective in HIV-infected patients. The drug combination includes a tablet containing lamivudine and zidovudine (called Combivir) plus abacavir plus efavirenz.    ,NCT00004585
HIV,The Effects of Anti-HIV Therapy on the Immune Systems of Children and Young Adults Infected With HIV, The purpose of this study is to determine the number of newly formed CD4 cells in children who have taken anti-HIV drugs. The study will also evaluate the effectiveness of the new CD4 cells in producing an immune response to hepatitis A and tetanus toxoid vaccination. Study hypothesis: 1) Immunologic reconstitution of individuals who have less than 15% CD4 cells may or may not be associated with functional activity. 2) The functional immunologic responses to recall and newly experienced antigens may be different. 3) The functional responses to antigens delivered in vaccine format may be a function of CD4 level viral load or both.    ,NCT00004735
HIV,Effectiveness of Anti-HIV Therapy (HAART) in HIV-Infected Patients With Tuberculosis, The purpose of this study is to see if a type of anti-HIV therapy called HAART is effective in lowering levels of HIV and boosting the immune system in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis (TB). HIV-infected patients with TB have higher levels of HIV and lower CD4 cell counts (cells in the body that fight infection) than HIV-infected patients without TB. HAART has been effective in reducing HIV levels and increasing CD4 cells in patients without TB. However its effects in HIV-infected patients with TB are unknown.    ,NCT00004736
HIV,The Metabolic Effects of Protease Inhibitors in HIV Infected Children," The use of protease inhibitors is increasing in HIV-infected children because this treatment has resulted in improved body weight improved immune status and less hospitalizations. However recent reports suggest that these drugs may also be associated with some negative side-effects specifically a syndrome of diabetes and fat redistribution. Development of the fat redistribution/diabetes syndrome has recently been reported in HIV-infected children as well as in adults. Diabetes is associated with complications such as increased heart disease eye disease and loss of kidney function. Thus development of diabetes is a significant problem which could outweigh the benefits obtained by treating patients with protease inhibitors. One major cause of diabetes is lack of normal response to insulin (insulin resistance). Insulin resistance tends to be worse in family members where one or more parent has diabetes and is also worse in certain ethnic groups. The first major purpose of our study is measure insulin resistance in HIV-infected children who do not take protease inhibitors and compare our findings to those from patients who are treated with protease inhibitors. We will also follow patients newly treated with protease inhibitors for two years to evaluate changes in insulin sensitivity. These results will be correlated with each patient's family history of diabetes and with ethnicity and should help us better predict which children are ""at risk"" for development of diabetes from protease inhibitor therapy. Children with HIV infection often have problems with gaining enough weight and with poor linear growth (height). One likely reason for this is the way their bodies use and store protein. The second purpose of our study is measure protein turnover and to correlate our findings with growth data. We also plan to study the effects of protease inhibitor therapy on protein turnover. We believe that these studies will provide knowledge to help clinicians formulate recommendations for nutritional and medical therapy.    ",NCT00004739
HIV,Oral Manifestations of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in High Risk Groups, OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the development of oral manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus infection in relationship to the onset of immunologic alterations and systemic symptoms in different risk groups: gay/bisexual men male intravenous drug users and female intravenous drug users. II. Evaluate the immune and inflammatory response to periodontal and other microbial pathogens. III. Evaluate the bacterial species infecting the oral cavity in patients in these risk groups.    ,NCT00004781
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Lamivudine When Given Once a Day Versus Twice a Day in Combination With Other Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-Infected Adults Who Have Never Received Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and effectiveness of receiving lamivudine (3TC) once a day versus twice a day as part of an anti-HIV drug combination.    ,NCT00004852
HIV,Effects of Two Anti-HIV Drug Combinations on the Immune Systems of HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Never Received Anti-HIV Drugs, This study will compare an anti-HIV drug combination of protease inhibitor plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) to one that includes three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus an NNRTI. NNRTIs NRTIs and protease inhibitors are all types of anti-HIV drugs that block the virus in some way. This study will try to find out if a treatment regimen containing a protease inhibitor plus an NNRTI has a different effect on the rise of CD4 cells compared to a treatment made up of three NRTIs plus an NNRTI. CD4 cells are cells of the immune system that fight infection. This study will also try to see if the combination of drugs used in this study is safe to use in HIV-positive patients.    ,NCT00004855
HIV,An International Study to Evaluate Recombinant Interleukin-2 in HIV Positive Patients Taking Anti-retroviral Therapy, The purpose of this study is to see if it is effective to give HIV positive patients recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) in addition to anti-HIV therapy. Patients will be followed over a minimum of 4 years to study the long-term effects of rIL-2 on their HIV disease progression. Anti-HIV therapy has been very successful in treating HIV positive patients and in keeping viral load (level of HIV in the blood) low. However anti-HIV drugs cannot completely rid the body of the virus and the immune system is never completely restored in HIV positive patients. Doctors hope that giving patients recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) in addition to their anti-HIV therapy will help improve their immune systems and keep them healthier over a longer period of time. rIL-2 is a hormone naturally produced by the body during an immune response to a microbial infection.    ,NCT00004978
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Three Anti-HIV Drugs Combined in One Pill (Trizivir), The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and effectiveness of a pill called Trizivir that is a combination of three anti-HIV drugs (zidovudine lamivudine and abacavir). Zidovudine and lamivudine are often given combined in one pill (Combivir). In this study Trizivir will be compared to Combivir plus abacavir.    ,NCT00004981
HIV,Combination Treatment Using Capravirine (AG1549) Nelfinavir and Two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors in HIV Patients Who Failed Initial Combination Therapy, The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of an anti-HIV drug combination that adds capravirine in patients who have failed their first drug combination treatment.    ,NCT00004985
HIV,Treatment of Advanced AIDS Patients With Dextrin Sulfate, The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and effectiveness of dextrin sulfate in AIDS patients who have failed conventional anti-HIV treatment.    ,NCT00004987
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of a New Anti-HIV Drug (AG1549) in Combination With Other Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to see if two different doses of AG1549 plus other anti-HIV drugs are safe and effective in HIV-infected patients who are not taking anti-HIV drugs.    ,NCT00004998
HIV,Effectiveness of a New Anti-HIV Drug (AG1549) Plus Viracept (Nelfinavir) Plus Combivir (Zidovudine/Lamivudine) in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of giving a new anti-HIV drug (AG1549) plus Viracept (nelfinavir) plus Combivir (a tablet containing zidovudine plus lamivudine) to HIV-infected patients who are not taking anti-HIV drugs.    ,NCT00004999
HIV,Treatment With Nelfinavir or Efavirenz of HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Never Received Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to compare two drugs (nelfinavir [NFV] and efavirenz [EFV]) used in start-up anti-HIV treatment. Doctors want to see if one is better than the other in extending the time that viral load (level of HIV in the blood) is kept low. The study will also look at the response of the immune system to each drug.    ,NCT00005000
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Treating HIV-Positive Patients With an HIV Vaccine (Remune), The purpose of this study is to see if giving HIV-positive patients an HIV vaccine plus anti-HIV drugs can help lower HIV levels in the blood (viral load).    ,NCT00005001
HIV,Effectiveness of Treating HIV-Positive Patients With an HIV Vaccine (Remune), The purpose of this study is to see if it is effective to add an HIV vaccine (Remune) to the anti-HIV drug combination of Combivir (zidovudine plus lamivudine) and nelfinavir.    ,NCT00005002
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of PEG-Intron in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to see if it is effective to give PEG-Intron (PEG-IFN) to HIV-infected patients who are not doing well with their current anti-HIV drug combination (HAART).    ,NCT00005012
HIV,Effectiveness and Safety of Epivir/Ziagen/Zerit (3TC/ABC/d4T) Versus Epivir/Ziagen/Sustiva (3TC/ABC/EFV) Versus Epivir/Ziagen/Agenerase/Norvir (3TC/ABC/APV/RTV) in HIV Patients Who Have Never Received Treatment, The purpose of this study is to see how effective and safe it is to give 1 of the 3 following treatments to patients who may not have received anti-HIV treatment: 1) lamivudine (3TC)/abacavir (ABC)/stavudine (d4T); 2) 3TC/ABC/efavirenz (EFV); or 3) 3TC/ABC/amprenavir (APV)/ritonavir (RTV).    ,NCT00005017
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of a Combination Anti-HIV Drug Treatment, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give HIV-positive patients a combination of anti-HIV drugs (abacavir [ABC] plus efavirenz [EFV] plus didanosine [ddI]) with and without hydroxyurea (HU).    ,NCT00005018
HIV,Observing Patients With Early HIV Infection, The purpose of this study is to monitor patients who have recently been infected with HIV in order to learn how their immune systems respond to HIV infection and to study how the virus multiplies in their bodies. Patients who have been infected with HIV recently are considered to have acute or early HIV infection. During this period viral load (level of HIV in the body) rises sharply to a high level at first but then decreases significantly on its own. Doctors are not sure why this decrease in viral load happens and how the body is able to accomplish this. In this study patients with acute HIV infection will be monitored so that doctors can study their immune systems to try to learn more about this rise and fall in viral load.    ,NCT00005020
HIV,A Comparison of Three Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of different anti-HIV drug combinations on body fat changes in HIV-positive patients who have never received anti-HIV therapy before.    ,NCT00005106
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of Indinavir Plus Ritonavir Plus Two NRTIs in HIV-Infected Patients Who Need Early Intervention Treatment, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give indinavir plus ritonavir plus 2 NRTIs to HIV-infected patients who need early intervention treatment.    ,NCT00005118
HIV,The Safety and Effectiveness of (+)-Calanolide A in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Never Taken Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give calanolide A to HIV-infected adults who have not used anti-HIV drugs in the past.    ,NCT00005120
HIV,Effectiveness of Giving an HIV Vaccine (Remune) to HIV-Positive Patients Receiving an Anti-HIV Drug Combination, The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of the HIV vaccine Remune on viral load (level of HIV in the blood) and on the way the immune system responds to HIV. This study will also try to see if the effects of the vaccine are different in patients entering the study with a viral load below 50 copies/ml compared to those who have a viral load from 50 to 500 copies/ml. (This study is currently being redesigned and the purpose may be revised.) Treatment with anti-HIV drugs does not always keep HIV viral load undetectable (so low that it cannot be measured). This study originally added an HIV vaccine called Remune to treat patients. Remune was thought to reduce viral load and improve immune responses. However new information suggests that Remune may not be as effective as was first believed. The study has been changed to follow people already in the study and to let people enroll only if they participate in the substudy. The substudy will look at the effect of another HIV vaccine vCP1452 on the immune response and how it works in combination with Remune. Information about the safety of these vaccines in HIV-positive patients will be gathered.    ,NCT00005758
HIV,Drug Interactions of Amprenavir and Efavirenz in Combination With a Second Protease Inhibitor in HIV-Negative Volunteers, The purpose of this study is to measure the blood levels of amprenavir (APV) alone APV combined with efavirenz (EFV) and APV/EFV combined with a third drug (nelfinavir [NFV] indinavir [IDV] ritonavir soft gel capsules [RTV sgc] or saquinavir soft gel capsules [SQV sgc]). Anti-HIV therapy with 3 or 4 drugs is currently the recommended approach for treating HIV infections. Doctors need to know the best dosages of certain drugs when they are given in combination. This study will measure the blood levels of APV alone APV combined with EFV and APV/EFV plus a second PI in healthy volunteers. It will study the safety and tolerance of these drugs.    ,NCT00005762
HIV,A Study of Increased Lactic Acid and Abnormal Fat Distribution in HIV-Positive Patients, The purpose of this study is to see if the findings of increased lactic acid and abnormal fat distribution get better when d4T is replaced with abacavir abacavir plus lamivudine or Combivir (a pill containing lamivudine plus zidovudine) in HIV-positive patients taking anti-HIV therapy including stavudine (d4T).    ,NCT00005764
HIV,Safety of the Candidate Vaccine C4-V3 Alone or With Interleukin-12 (IL-12) in HIV-Infected Patients Receiving Effective Anti-HIV Drug Therapy, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give C4-V3 a possible HIV vaccine alone or in conjunction with 4 different doses of interleukin-12 (IL-12) to HIV-infected patients who are taking anti-HIV drugs that have lowered the amount of HIV in patients' blood. (This study has been changed so that vaccine is administered alone or with 4 different doses of IL-12.) Immune cells known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) help destroy HIV-infected cells. However in most patients CTLs decrease over time. This allows HIV levels to rise and AIDS symptoms to develop. The C4-V3 vaccine contains small pieces of HIV protein that can boost CTL levels allowing the body's immune system to fight HIV. Giving IL-12 a normal part of the immune system with C4-V3 may make the vaccine more effective.    ,NCT00005779
HIV,A Comparison of Two Anti-HIV Treatment Plans, The purpose of this study is to compare 2 treatment plans to try to increase the effects of anti-HIV drugs in patients who are resistant to the drug effects. Sometimes the increase in a patient's viral load (the level of HIV in the blood) can be slowed or stopped by taking anti-HIV drugs. This does not always happen. Sometimes anti-HIV drugs work at first but then stop working. When most of the usual anti-HIV drugs no longer seem to work the virus is called multidrug-resistant (MDR). This study will compare 2 treatment plans to try to increase the effects of anti-HIV drugs in patients with MDR virus.    ,NCT00005915
HIV,Effectiveness and Safety of Two Forms of Stavudine in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of 2 forms of stavudine (d4T). One form is taken once a day (extended release) and the other form is taken twice a day (immediate release).    ,NCT00005918
HIV,The Effect of Anti-HIV Treatment on Body Characteristics of HIV-Infected Children, The purpose of this study is to see how beginning or changing anti-HIV medications affects the body composition (weight height growth body fat and muscle mass or fat and muscle distribution) of HIV-infected children. This study also looks at how changes in body composition relate to changes in viral load (level of HIV in the blood) CD4 cell counts height and weight in HIV-infected children. This study also compares changes in body composition to levels of cytokines (proteins in the body that affect some immune cells) in HIV-infected children who are beginning or changing anti-HIV therapy. Though studies have been done on adults little is known about the effects of HIV infection and anti-HIV drugs on body composition in children. One theory is that changes in body composition can predict the failure of anti-HIV treatment. If this is true body composition measurements can be as useful as CD4+ cell counts in determining drug effectiveness.    ,NCT00006064
HIV,Interleukin-2 Plus Anti-HIV Therapy in HIV-Infected Children With Weakened Immune Systems, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of a drug called interleukin-2 (IL-2) given with anti-HIV therapy in children with HIV infection. This study will also determine the best dose of IL-2 to give children. IL-2 is an important substance produced by the body's white blood cells that helps the body fight infection. People with HIV infection do not produce enough IL-2. It is hoped that IL-2 treatment will help boost the immune system in people with HIV infection. It has not been studied very much in children and doctors need to know what doses are safe to give.    ,NCT00006066
HIV,A Study of Chlorhexidine in the Prevention of HIV-1 Transmission From Mothers to Their Babies, The purpose of this study is to find the best strength of chlorhexidine (a solution that kills germs) for washing the mother's vagina during labor and the newborn baby that may reduce the chance of HIV being passed from an HIV-positive mother to the baby. When used as a wash on the vagina during labor and on a newborn shortly after birth a higher dose of chlorhexidine is more likely to reduce the rate of HIV-1 transmission from mother to baby. Laboratory tests suggest that a higher dose of chlorhexidine will be more effective in killing HIV.    ,NCT00006075
HIV,Growth Hormone Treatment of Children With HIV-Associated Growth Failure, The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH) on growth in HIV-infected children. Studies have shown that HIV-infected children do not grow at a normal rate and are shorter than HIV-uninfected children who are the same age. Growth hormone has been used for many years to treat children with growth hormone deficiency and has been safe and effective in helping them to grow normally. The growth hormone to be used in this study r-hGH is an investigational hormone (not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) made in the laboratory. It has helped HIV-positive adults gain weight and improve their physical performance. This study has been changed to include a needle-free device for drug delivery which will improve patient comfort and acceptability. Patients will no longer receive growth hormone through traditional needles but through a needle-free device.    ,NCT00006143
HIV,A Study of HIV-Disease Development in Aging, The purpose of this study is to better understand the relationship between age and HIV disease progression. This study will explore the possible relationship between age and HIV disease progression. Older age is an important risk factor for faster disease development but older people may respond better to combination drug therapy. This relationship needs to be understood better.    ,NCT00006144
HIV,A Study to See If Taking One or Two Extra Drugs Can Lower HIV Levels in Patients Who Have Failed Their Anti-HIV Drug Treatment," The purpose of this study is to see if adding 1 or 2 drugs to the anti-HIV therapy of patients whose HIV levels increased while taking their anti-HIV drugs can lower viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) and keep it low up to Week 24. (This study has been changed. Previously only patients whose levels increased on their first round of anti-HIV drugs were being studied.) Anti-HIV drug treatments that contain a combination of 3 or more drugs can lower HIV levels raise CD4 cell counts and improve survival. Unfortunately many patients ""fail"" their anti-HIV drug treatment when their HIV levels go above 500 copies/ml. Usually the next step is to switch the patient to different anti-HIV drugs. Doctors would like to see whether adding 1 or 2 different drugs to the ""failed"" treatment also can lower HIV levels. Adding 1 or 2 drugs might be better than switching all of the drugs since patients who take many different drugs can develop drug-resistant HIV. (This study has been changed. Previously only patients taking protease inhibitors (PI) whose levels increased on their first round of anti-HIV drugs were being studied.)    ",NCT00006152
HIV,Effectiveness of Adding Remune to Your Current Anti-HIV Drug Combination," The purpose of this study is to see if giving a vaccine (Remune) is effective in HIV-positive patients who are also taking anti-HIV therapy. Regular treatment of HIV-positive patients with anti-HIV drugs slows the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body. A vaccine called Remune works to stop the virus infection by ""boosting"" the body's immune cell defense against the HIV virus before the virus enters cells. It also blocks the virus from entering the cells. This study will see whether Remune will improve the immune cell natural defense in patients who are also taking anti-HIV drugs.    ",NCT00006153
HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Use of a Protease Inhibitor and of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the Treatment of Early HIV Infection, The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of combination anti-HIV drug therapy (with protease inhibitors [PIs] or without) in patients with early HIV infections. This study also looks at whether a drug called interleukin-2 (IL-2) can boost the immune system of these patients. Doctors are not sure which anti-HIV drug combination is best to use in patients who have early HIV infection and have never received anti-HIV treatment. PIs are anti-HIV drugs that decrease viral load (level of HIV in the blood). However PIs can cause serious side effects in some patients. Doctors would like to know if a drug combination that does not contain a PI is just as good as one that contains PIs.    ,NCT00006154
HIV,Underlying Abnormalities in Fat and Muscle Leading to Lipodystrophy Syndrome, With the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy(HAART) patients with HIV disease are developing a series of metabolic abnormalities including peripheral fat wasting increase in truncal fat high serum triglyceride levels insulin(a hormone that controls blood sugar) resistance with an increased incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and elevated blood pressure. The premise of this study is that abnormalities in the ability of fat and muscle tissue to respond to the hormone insulin may be the cause of the diabetes mellitus high serum triglyceride levels and abnormal fat distribution. The purpose of the study is to assess how insulin resistant patients with HIV disease are and if their fat and muscle tissue are responding abnormally to insulin. This is done by administering insulin and taking small tissue samples of fat and muscle from the upper thigh and assessing how good insulin acts in these tissues. Patients with HIV disease will be admitted into the study after undergoing a screening medical history and examination. Once patients qualify they will have their insulin resistance measured as well as the response of their fat and muscle to insulin; blood levels of glucose (sugar) cholesterol and triglycerides will be measured; body fat will be assessed using radiological tests; a detailed medical history will be obtained to assess risk factors for developing this syndrome. Patients who are found to be insulin resistant will be offered a trial of an insulin sensitizing agent called Avandia for 6-12 weeks. It is hoped that the Avandia will restore the body's ability to respond normally to insulin (as it does in patients with Diabetes) and perhaps improve the fat abnormalities as well. All the same measures will be performed at the end of the course of Avandia as were done at baseline. Patients who are not insulin resistant will be asked to come back yearly to assess whether they develop insulin resistance over time. This study will continue to recruit patients over the next 3 years.    ,NCT00006185
HIV,A Study to Determine How and Why HIV-Infected Subjects on Anti-viral Treatment Develop Lipodystrophy, HIV infection is a major global health problem. Survival and quality of life for HIV subjects has tremendously improved with the advent of a class of antivirals called protease inhibitors and the utilization of highly active combination therapy. However such therapy has been associated with a syndrome called lipodystrophy. This lipodystrophy syndrome causes body shape changes; typically thinning and loss of fat from the arms legs and face with increased fat appearing in the abdomen and neck. There are also metabolic changes which occur and subjects can develop increased triglycerides increased cholesterol and an increased risk for diabetes as indicated by increasing insulin resistance. This study will take HIV positive subjects who have not yet started antiviral medications (treatment naive)and randomly assign them to one of two treatment arms. These treatment arms will be: Sustiva/Zerit/Epivir vs. Viracept/Zerit/Epivir The subjects will be treated and followed for two years and have extensive metabolic testing skinfold thickness measurements MRI scans and other measures to determine if and how they are experiencing changes in metabolism or body shape and to discover the mechanism of why this occurs. Understanding the mechanism should allow researchers to design interventions for subjects who have lipodystrophy and strategies to prevent lipodystrophy from occurring to subjects treated with antivirals in the future.    ,NCT00006190
HIV,Safety and Tolerability of the Vaginal Gel PRO 2000/5, The purpose of this study is to determine whether the vaginal gel PRO 2000/5 causes irritation when used daily. Studies have shown PRO 2000/5 is safe and well tolerated as a vaginal gel in healthy women who are not sexually active. However it was not determined what side effects to skin in the vaginal area there might be in sexually active women.    ,NCT00006207
HIV,A Comparison of Emtricitabine and Stavudine Used With Didanosine Plus Efavirenz in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Not Taken Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of emtricitabine and stavudine when given with didanosine plus efavirenz to HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT00006208
HIV,A Study of Tucaresol in HIV-Infected Patients Who Are Taking Other Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give tucaresol to HIV-infected patients who are taking combination anti-HIV therapy (HAART). This study also examines the effect tucaresol has on viral load (level of HIV in the body) when tucaresol is used with HAART.    ,NCT00006209
HIV,A Study of Capravirine Plus VIRACEPT Plus Two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors in HIV-Infected Patients Who Failed Previous Anti-HIV Treatments, The purpose of this study is to see if the addition of capravirine to VIRACEPT (nelfinavir mesylate) plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is an effective combination drug therapy for HIV patients who have failed a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) therapy.    ,NCT00006211
HIV,The Safety of Nevirapine When Given to Breast-Feeding Babies From Birth to Age 6 Months, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give nevirapine (NVP) to breast-feeding babies from birth to the age of 6 months and to determine what dose of NVP should be given. Breast-feeding has been shown to be very important for the physical and mental health of infants. This is especially true during the first 6 months of life. However an HIV-positive mother can pass the virus on to her baby by breast-feeding. Because of this risk HIV-positive mothers are encouraged to formula-feed not breast-feed their babies. In developing countries however some women cannot afford to formula-feed. If they do formula-feed these women risk exposing their HIV status. These women have great need for methods that can lower the chance that they will pass HIV on to their babies. This study will test NVP as a way of doing this.    ,NCT00006279
HIV,Perceived Changes in Body Build and Image in Patients Who Are Now Taking or Recently Have Stopped Taking Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to learn how changes in body build affect the lives of people taking anti-HIV medications. By learning this a set of questions can be created to help understand how changes in body build and image affect people living with HIV infection. A set of questions used to measure body image might be useful in future HIV studies. It may help doctors understand patient concerns about their body image and why some patients stop taking their anti-HIV medications.    ,NCT00006290
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Adding Either an HIV Vaccine Interleukin-2 or Both to a Patient's Anti-HIV Drug Combination, The purpose of this study is to see if adding an HIV vaccine (ALVAC-HIV vCP1452) IL-2 (interleukin-2 a protein found in the blood that helps boost the immune system) or both to anti-HIV-drug therapy is safe tolerable and effective in controlling viral load (level of HIV in the body). (This study has been changed to clarify drug name.) Anti-HIV drugs can help reduce a patient's viral load. However HIV can still remain in CD4 cells (cells of the immune system that help fight infection). Combining an HIV vaccine IL-2 or both with anti-HIV drugs may help reduce the number of HIV-infected cells.    ,NCT00006291
HIV,Studies of HIV-1 Infection in Newly Infected Individuals in Southern Africa, The main goal of this study is to find out how the immune system responds to a specific type of HIV infection known as C HIV-1 in order to develop a vaccine against this type of infection. The study involves Southern African populations. The HIV-1 virus changes rapidly and many different subtypes have been found. In South Africa limited data have suggested Subtype C HIV-1 is the most common. This study strives to verify the most common subtype and also look at genetic differences and immune responses among newly infected individuals. Results will aid in the development of vaccines specific for certain geographical areas.    ,NCT00006298
HIV,Long-Term Effects of HIV Exposure and Infection in Children, As new drugs and vaccines are developed to prevent HIV disease progression and prolong survival of HIV infected patients the short-term safety and effectiveness of these treatments are evaluated in research studies. However the long-term effects whether they are benefits or side effects need to be studied as well. These long-term effects may have a greater impact on infants and children who are still growing and developing. The purpose of this study is to follow HIV-exposed and HIV infected infants children and adolescents who are seen at Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) study sites. These patients will be observed for long-term benefits or any late harmful effects of medications or vaccines.    ,NCT00006304
HIV,Withdrawal of Antifungal Treatment for Histoplasmosis in Patients After Improved Immune Response to Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to determine whether stopping preventive histoplasmosis medications in patients who are currently receiving effective anti-HIV drugs will place them at risk for getting histoplasmosis again. Histoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic (AIDS-related) infection that responds well to antifungal medications. Before anti-HIV drugs patients with histoplasmosis required lifelong antifungal therapy. Patients who take anti-HIV drugs for a long time may see an improvement in their immune system functions. Improved immune function may eliminate the need for long-term preventive treatment with antifungal agents. Doctors want to see if the improved immune functions allow preventive treatment for histoplasmosis to be stopped. (This study has been changed to include histoplasmosis treatment with drugs other than itraconazole.)    ,NCT00006316
HIV,Hormonal Birth Control and the Risk of Acquiring HIV, The purpose of this study is to find out whether hormonal birth control increases decreases or does not change the risk of women becoming infected with HIV. Sexual intercourse between men and women is the main way HIV is transmitted. About 90 percent of HIV infections in women are caused by sexual intercourse. Also hormonal birth controls are widely used. This study hopes to find out whether hormonal birth control changes the risk of women becoming infected with HIV.    ,NCT00006324
HIV,Safety Tolerability and Anti-HIV Activity of PEG-Intron in HIV-Positive Children, The purpose of this study is to see if PEG-Intron is safe and tolerated when given to children to see how much gets into the blood and how long it stays in the blood and to see how well it works to reduce viral load (level of HIV in the blood). PEG-Intron is an experimental drug that works differently than other anti-HIV medications. It decreases the ability of HIV to infect the T cells (a special type of cell that helps fight infection). PEG-Intron has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hepatitis C in adults but in this study it is being used as an investigational agent for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It has not been tested in children before and experience with PEG-Intron in adults is limited. (This protocol has been changed to reflect FDA approval of PEG-Intron for treating hepatitic C in adults.)    ,NCT00006325
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of 3 Anti-HIV Treatments in Patients Who Have Failed Previous Treatments Containing Nelfinavir, The purpose of this study is to see if 3 anti-HIV drug combinations are safe and effective in patients who have failed previous anti-HIV treatments using nelfinavir (NFV).    ,NCT00006326
HIV,Effectiveness of AIDSVAX B/E Vaccine in Intravenous Drug Users in Bangkok Thailand, The purpose of this study is to determine if the vaccine AIDSVAX B/E will protect intravenous drug users from becoming infected with HIV.    ,NCT00006327
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of an Anti-HIV Drug Combination With and Without Hydroxyurea in Patients With Early HIV Infection, The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of an anti-HIV drug combination with and without hydroxyurea in patients with early HIV infection. Certain combinations of anti-HIV drugs have been effective in lowering levels of HIV in the blood and keeping them down. However these treatments are not effective in some patients. This study will see if using a combination containing more drugs will help in patients with early HIV infection.    ,NCT00006339
HIV,Effectiveness of AZT and Nevirapine in Preventing HIV Transmission From Ugandan Mothers to Their Newborns, The purpose of this study is to see if nevirapine (NVP) or zidovudine (AZT) given to mothers during labor and delivery and to their babies during the first week of life can reduce the rate of mothers passing HIV to their babies. About 25 percent of HIV-infected mothers pass HIV infection to their babies during labor and delivery. There is an urgent need to find a simpler way to prevent mother-to-infant transmission during labor and delivery. The proposed NVP schedule is simpler and possibly could be used in Uganda.    ,NCT00006396
HIV,Differences Between Women and Men Taking a Combination of Indinavir Ritonavir Enteric-Coated Didanosine and Stavudine Who Previously Took Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective it is to give multi-drug treatment with indinavir (IDV) plus ritonavir (RTV) plus enteric-coated didanosine (ddI) plus stavudine (d4T) and if there are differences in responses between men and women.    ,NCT00006397
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Fenofibrate and Pravastatin in HIV-Positive Patients With Abnormal Blood Lipids, The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of fenofibrate and pravastatin in treating HIV-positive patients who have abnormal levels of fat (lipids) in the blood. Increased lipids in the blood associated with HIV infection and anti-HIV drugs is a growing problem. The drugs used in this study are known to reduce certain lipids but little is known about their safety and effectiveness. This study will see if one of the drugs is safer and more effective than the other or if combining the drugs is the safest and most effective way to lower lipids. This study has been changed. On June 26 2001 this study was reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB is an independent board monitoring the progress of the study. The review showed that neither pravastatin nor fenofibrate alone were effective in reaching all the cholesterol and triglyceride goals. There were no safety concerns. It is not known if the combination of fenofibrate and pravastatin is effective and safe. Therefore it is important to continue this study.    ,NCT00006412
HIV,A Study of Patients Who Recently Have Been Infected With HIV, The purpose of this study is to find out if anti-HIV drugs taken by patients who are newly infected with HIV can make the level of HIV in the body too low to detect. Studying patients who recently have been infected with HIV may help researchers understand how HIV infection works and how anti-HIV drugs may help these patients. Approved anti-HIV drugs can reduce the amount of HIV but more research needs to be done in newly infected patients. This study will look at recently HIV-infected patients to study the progression of HIV disease and to see whether anti-HIV drugs can reduce the level of HIV.    ,NCT00006415
HIV,Effects of Home Visits on Medication Adherence in Children and Youth With HIV, Adherence to complex medication regimens is critical to successful treatment of HIV infection. Unfortunately adherence to medical regimens with conventional interventions averages 50% in chronic disease. We have observed that adherence barriers that were unrecognized by providers in the clinic setting have been detected during home visits. It is possible that recognition and interventions to resolve adherence barriers observed during home visits may improve adherence. This proposal will test the hypothesis that home-visits which identify previously unrecognized adherence barriers and provide support and education will increase medication adherence among children and youth with HIV infection and improve the patient/health care provider relationship. Specific aims of the study are: 1. Determine the impact of a series of home-visits on adherence to medication regimens for HIV infected youth and children. 1a. Adherence to medical regimens will be assessed before and after the series of home-visits using a self-report questionnaire and Microelectronic Monitoring System (MEMS) or in-home pill count. 1b. For each of these measures a percentage of adherence will be calculated and compared from a baseline to after the final home visit and after the six month follow up period. 2. Assess the changes in patient satisfaction from baseline to after the home-visits using a questionnaire completed by the patient/family. 3. Incorporate a pilot study to assess the changes in the provider's knowledge of the patient's family characteristics and home circumstances relevant to adherence following the home visits.    ,NCT00006439
HIV,A Test of Behavioral Intervention for Women at High Risk for HIV Infection, The purpose of this study is to find out if it is possible to conduct a group counseling program for women at risk for HIV infection. Women have been the fastest-growing group with new AIDS diagnoses. The need for ways to reduce HIV infection in women is urgent. It is important to reduce the risk of HIV infection through sexual contact but it is also important to address drug use. Group counseling may be an effective method.    ,NCT00006440
HIV,Effectiveness of Adding Interleukin-2 to Anti-HIV Drugs in Patients Recently Infected With HIV, The purpose of this study is to see whether taking interleukin-2 (IL-2) and other anti-HIV drugs affects the course of HIV disease in patients with primary HIV infection (the time period that immediately follows infection with HIV). After primary HIV infection the actual infection is spread through an increasing amount of HIV virus in the body. Studies have shown that by taking a combination of anti-HIV drugs it is possible to reduce the amount of HIV in the body to almost undetectable levels. This study will find out if starting anti-HIV drugs during primary infection will interrupt or reduce the spread of HIV in patients' bodies.    ,NCT00006441
HIV,The Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs on the HIV Virus in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to examine the HIV virus in the blood and lymphoid tissues of patients taking anti-HIV medications. HIV infection is closely linked to the growth of the HIV virus in the body. Much of this information was obtained from studying how the HIV virus grows in circulating blood. Recent studies have shown that the lymphoid tissue (part of the immune system) is a major site where HIV is found in the body and is also where much of the HIV virus growth occurs. This study will examine not only blood but also lymphoid tissue to gain a better understanding of the disease and how to treat it.    ,NCT00006442
HIV,Effectiveness of Anti-HIV Drugs in Patients Who Have Not Received Previous Anti-HIV Drugs During Different Stages of HIV Infection, The purpose of this study is to compare changes in HIV levels and certain immune cells among patients at different stages of HIV infection. This study will also see how a combination of stavudine (d4T) lamivudine (3TC) indinavir (IDV) and nelfinavir (NFV) affects these levels. Current findings in anti-HIV drug treatment have led to a greater understanding of the background of HIV. To find the best anti-HIV treatment to eliminate all HIV viruses cells and tissues infected with the HIV virus are examined after combination anti-HIV treatment when the level of HIV infection is low. The ERADICATE study will examine the idea that HIV viruses can be eliminated at any stage of infection over time.    ,NCT00006443
HIV,The Effects of Combination Anti-HIV Medication on Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in HIV-Infected Women, The purpose of this study is to see how often human papillomavirus (HPV) occurs in HIV-infected women who have not taken anti-HIV drugs and to learn whether taking anti-HIV drugs will affect HPV in women. HIV infection increases the risk of getting HPV infection. Findings suggest that HIV infection as well as a weakened immune system may increase the chances of getting HPV. Aggressive anti-HIV medication has been shown to strengthen the immune system. Researchers want to learn whether anti-HIV drugs affect the HPV virus or decrease the chances of getting HPV. This study is important because it may provide important information to help manage a woman's health and to determine a woman's risk for developing problems with the cervix (outer end of the uterus).    ,NCT00006444
HIV,A Comparison of Two Tests for Anti-HIV Drug Resistance, The purpose of this study is to compare 2 different types of tests of the HIV virus to see which specific anti-HIV drugs would work the best. Drug resistance is a major reason for therapy failure in HIV patients. Two types of tests can detect resistance to drugs: 1) genotyping (sequencing) which looks at the DNA sequence of a virus to see whether it has developed any genetic resistance; 2) phenotyping which looks at the ability of different drugs to suppress virus growth in the laboratory. Genotyping and phenotyping can help doctors give patients the most effective drug therapy.    ,NCT00006490
HIV,Rosiglitazone in the Treatment of HIV-Associated Hyperlipidemia," The purpose of this research is to study the effects of rosiglitazone a drug usually taken for Type II diabetes on HIV-associated hyperlipidemia. HIV-associated lipodystrophy is a medical condition characterized by gradual changes in the distribution of body fat. The body fat located in the extremities and face disappears while body fat around the abdomen and upper back increases. Certain biochemical changes occur in association with these changes in fat distribution. Lipid levels particularly serum triglycerides are increased. HDL the ""good cholesterol"" is decreased. Higher than normal level of insulin or insulin resistance is also found in this condition. This latter condition is one of the hallmarks of Type II diabetes. The protease inhibitors a class of HIV medications are associated with the occurrence of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. It has been suggested that a biochemical pathway known as the peripheral peroxisomal activating receptor (PPAR) gamma system is blocked leading to the onset of this condition. Rosiglitazone is a new drug approved by the FDA in 1999 for the treatment of type II diabetes. It lowers blood sugar by improving insulin resistance which as mentioned before is the hallmark of Type II diabetes. It has also been noted to improve blood lipid levels. Rosiglitazone works by stimulating the PPAR gamma system. It is hoped that this drug can turn on the PPAR system and reverse the HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome.    ",NCT00006493
HIV,Immune Responses in HIV-Positive Patients Receiving an Anti-HIV Drug Combination When Given the HIV Vaccines Remune and vCP1452, The purpose of this study is to see how the vaccines Remune (HIV-1 immunogen) and vCP1452 affect immune responses in patients who also are taking anti-HIV medications. This study also will see if these vaccines are safe to use either alone or in combination. Treatment with anti-HIV drugs does not always keep HIV viral load low and under control. This study will look at the effect of the HIV vaccine vCP1452 on the immune response and how it works in combination with Remune. Information about immune responses and the safety of these vaccines in HIV-positive patients will be gathered.    ,NCT00006495
HIV,A Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of an HIV Vaccine for HIV-Positive Patients Receiving Anti-HIV Drugs for at Least 2 Years, The purpose of this study is to see if 2 study vaccines ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452) and gp160 MN/LAI-2 are safe and effective in boosting the body's attacks on HIV in HIV-positive patients. HIV-infected patients who have been treated with anti-HIV drugs for a long time may have weakened immune responses. One way to strengthen these responses may be to have a safe and effective vaccine which will boost immune responses that are specific to HIV.    ,NCT00006509
HIV,Evaluation of Specific Infection-Fighting Cells For Prediction of Immune Response to Anti-HIV and Immune-Boosting Medication, The purpose of this study is to see if the amount of stem cells (cells that can develop into many kinds of cells) in the blood before anti-HIV drugs are taken can predict if the immune system will become stronger after anti-HIV drugs are given and if anti-HIV drugs can restore stem cells. HIV infection has been shown to cause stem cells not to function well. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) which causes stem cells to go from the bone marrow (tissues in the bones where blood cells are formed) into the bloodstream could possibly help boost immunity after anti-HIV treatment. This study examines the effects of G-CSF in helping the immune system become stronger after beginning anti-HIV treatment.    ,NCT00006578
HIV,Ritonavir and Agenerase Treatment for Patients Who Have Failed Previous Anti-HIV Treatment, The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with an anti-HIV drug containing ritonavir and Agenerase is safe and can lower the level of HIV in the blood in patients who have failed an anti-HIV drug treatment containing nelfinavir.    ,NCT00006591
HIV,Atazanavir Used in Combination With Other Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-Infected Infants Children and Adolescents, The purpose of this study was to find a safe and tolerable dose of the protease inhibitor (PI) atazanavir (ATV) with or without a low-dose boost of the PI ritonavir (RTV) when taken with other anti-HIV drugs in HIV infected infants children and adolescents. Advancements in anti-HIV drugs for HIV infected children and adolescents have been hard to make in part because these patients often do not take the drugs as prescribed. ATV may be a better option because it is available in the form of powder which children and adolescents may be more willing to take regularly. Using a low dose of RTV as a boosting agent for ATV may also increase the chances of virologic response of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART)-experienced patients. This study aimed to find safe and tolerable doses of ATV with or without low-dose RTV boost in infants children and adolescents. For this study participants were enrolled in the United States and South Africa.    ,NCT00006604
HIV,Four-Drug Combination Therapy With Zidovudine Lamivudine 1592U89 (Abacavir) and 141W94 (Amprenavir) in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to see if the multidrug combination of zidovudine (ZDV) lamivudine (3TC) 1592U89 (abacavir [ABC]) and 141W94 (amprenavir [APV]) is a safe and effective treatment for HIV-infected patients and if there is a reduction of active HIV in blood and other tissues. HIV infection is a life-changing illness and new HIV treatments must be tested. This study will test if a 4-drug combination will reduce HIV virus activity in blood and other tissues and if it is safe and well tolerated. Doctors also want to know if the multidrug combination is able to decrease viral activity over a long time period.    ,NCT00006617
HIV,Comparing Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Liver Biopsy to Evaluate the Liver in Patients With HIV and Hepatitis C Virus, The purpose of this study is to find if the Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scan is as effective as a liver biopsy (using a special needle to remove tissue from the liver) in examining liver damage in patients with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). A standard way to examine the liver for disease has been to perform a liver biopsy. The SPECT scan which takes a picture of the liver has been found to be effective in determining liver damage but studies need to be done in patients with hepatitis. This study will compare the effectiveness of the liver biopsy and SPECT scan in determining liver disease in patients with HIV and HCV. The SPECT scan might be a good replacement for the liver biopsy if it is found to be as good as or better than liver biopsies.    ,NCT00006643
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of a Three-Drug Combination Treatment for Recently Infected or Converted HIV Patients, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of stavudine (d4T) didanosine (ddI) and BMS-232632 when given early in the course of HIV infection. Acute HIV infection may develop in patients that are exposed to the HIV virus. Following infection the viral load (level of HIV in the blood) rises rapidly over the next few days to weeks. It is not known which is the best treatment in patients with very early HIV infection. Researchers believe these patients may respond well to strong early treatment. A combination consisting of enteric-coated didanosine (ddI-EC) stavudine (d4T) and the HIV-1 protease inhibitor BMS-232632 will be tested.    ,NCT00007202
HIV,Carotid Artery Thickness in HIV Infected and Uninfected Adults, The intima-media thickness (IMT) test is a low cost non-invasive way to measure the thickness of the carotid artery (the large artery in the neck). The purpose of this study is to compare the thickness of the carotid artery among HIV infected adults taking protease inhibitors (PIs) HIV infected adults not taking PIs and HIV uninfected adults and to examine how the thickness may change over time.    ,NCT00007319
HIV,Safety and Immune Response Study of the Vaccine ALVAC vCP1452 Alone or in Combination With AIDSVAX B/B, The purpose of this study is to see if the vaccines tested are safe when given alone and when given together and how the immune system responds to the vaccines. Vaccines are given to people to try to prevent an infection or disease. Early testing in a few people has shown that the HIV vaccines ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX B/B seem to be safe to use.    ,NCT00007332
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of the Vaccine ALVAC-HIV vCP205 in HIV-Negative Adult Volunteers in Uganda, The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give ALVAC-HIV vCP205 a possible HIV vaccine and to study the immune responses in adult HIV-1 uninfected volunteers. Uganda has been severely affected by HIV infection and AIDS and has been selected to participate in HIV-vaccine development. The HIV viruses commonly isolated from Uganda are 2 kinds that are not used in making current vaccines. Current vaccines generate several kinds of immune responses. Researchers would like to see if a response to the kind of virus in a current vaccine will also protect people from the viruses commonly found in Uganda.    ,NCT00007423
HIV,The Safety of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Taken With Other Anti-HIV Drugs to Treat HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) in combination with other anti-HIV drugs in patients who have participated in other tenofovir DF studies (GS-98-902 or GS-99-907) are able to tolerate the drug at different doses and may benefit from having tenofovir DF treatment.    ,NCT00007436
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of the Drug DPC 083 in Combination With Nucleoside Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors in HIV-1-Infected Patients Who Are Failing Treatment With Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the study drug DPC 083 combined with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-infected patients who are failing their nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) treatment. In some studies DPC 083 (an NNRTI) has been found to lower the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) where drug-resistant types of HIV were not lowered by other NNRTIs. This study will attempt to determine how safe DPC 083 is when it is taken in combination with 2 NRTIs.    ,NCT00007449
HIV,HIV in Specific Parts of the Body of Patients Who Are Changing or Starting Potent Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to gain information on how the type and amount of HIV present in certain places in the body and in the blood are affected when potent (powerful) anti-HIV drugs are given. Researchers know that the type and amount of HIV may differ in certain places in the body (called compartments) but are not sure how anti-HIV treatment affects these differences. This study gathers information to help understand how the virus grows and changes between blood and nonblood compartments in patients receiving anti-HIV treatment.    ,NCT00007488
HIV,A Comparison of the Effectiveness Safety and Tolerability of Two Different Hepatitis C Treatments in Patients Infected With Both HIV and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), The purpose of this study is to see if treatment with PEG-interferon-alfa-2a (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin is a more effective treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) than interferon-alfa-2a (IFN) plus ribavirin for patients infected with both HCV and HIV. The study will also compare the 2 regimens to see which has fewer side effects. HCV infection is common in patients infected with HIV. Patients infected with both HIV and HCV viruses seem to have more severe hepatitis C. A combination of IFN and ribavirin has been shown to lessen the severity of HCV. PEG-IFN is a modified form of IFN that stays in the blood longer which means that patients would not have to take the treatment as often. This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of PEG-IFN to IFN when each is combined with ribavirin.    ,NCT00008463
HIV,Comparing Side Effects of Two Forms of Videx in HIV-Infected Adults, The purpose of this study is to compare gastrointestinal (stomach and intestines) side effects of 2 forms of Videx in HIV-infected patients. Videx can be an effective anti-HIV treatment but many patients will not take the medication due to its side effects. Videx EC is a capsule form of the drug and may have fewer side effects. Also patients would not have to take as many pills since patients taking Videx EC would have to take only 1 capsule per day instead of 2 tablets per day. This study will see if patients taking Videx EC have fewer side effects.    ,NCT00008489
HIV,T-20 With Anti-HIV Combination Therapy for Patients With Prior Anti-HIV Drug Treatment and/or Drug Resistance to Each of the Three Classes of Approved Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to compare the change in viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) of patients who receive T-20 with selected anti-HIV drugs to that of patients who receive only selected anti-HIV drugs.    ,NCT00008528
HIV,Comparison of GW433908 and Nelfinavir in HIV Patients Who Have Not Had Antiretroviral Therapy, The purpose of this study is to compare GW433908 and nelfinavir when each is given with abacavir and lamivudine to HIV patients who have not taken antiretroviral drugs.    ,NCT00008554
HIV,Effectiveness of Early or Delayed Addition of Hydroxyurea to a Three-Drug Anti-HIV Drug Combination Including Didanosine in Advanced HIV Patients Who Failed a First or Second Anti-HIV Triple-Drug Therapy, The purpose of this study is to find out whether or not the addition of hydroxyurea to didanosine (ddI) and other anti-HIV medications will result in better control of HIV infection. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ddI for treating HIV infections. Hydroxyurea is approved for treating some cancers and blood disorders. It works against HIV-1 when combined with ddI. Researchers need to look at how well patients may respond to hydroxyurea in combination with ddI and other anti-HIV drugs and at any side effects.    ,NCT00008866
HIV,Comparison of GW433908/Ritonavir to Nelfinavir When Used With Abacavir and Lamivudine in Patients That Have Not Taken Antiretroviral Drugs, The purpose of this study is to compare virus response to GW433908/ritonavir (RTV) to viral response to nelfinavir (NFV) when used with abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) in patients that have not taken antiretroviral (ART) drugs.    ,NCT00009061
HIV,Testosterone for HIV-Positive Men With Reduced Serum Testosterone Levels and Abdominal Fat, The purpose of this study is to see if treatment with testosterone will reduce abdominal fat in HIV-positive men. Many HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy show an increase in abdominal fat. Studies have shown that treatment with testosterone may decrease abdominal fat. This study will determine if testosterone will reduce abdominal fat in HIV patients.    ,NCT00009555
HIV,Study of Total Body Irradiation in Combination With Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplantation Followed By Cyclosporine and Mycophenolate Mofetil in High Risk-Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1, OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of total body irradiation and post-transplant cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil in high-risk patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1. II. Determine whether this regimen results in stable mixed donor lymphocyte chimerism (5-95% donor CD3) in this patient population. III. Determine the kinetics of immune reconstruction following this treatment regimen in this patient population. IV. Determine the effect of this treatment regimen on viral load in this patient population.    ,NCT00010348
HIV,Acupuncture and Moxa: A Randomized Clinical Trial for Chronic Diarrhea in HIV Patients," The objective of this study is to test alternative treatment strategies to reduce the frequency of chronic diarrhea among HIV positive individuals. 60 percent of patients with HIV disease in the U.S. will have diarrhea at some point in their illness. Although in general many of the opportunistic infections (OI's) associated with HIV have decreased due to new ""drug cocktails"" many of these drugs however have diarrhea as a side effect. In Asian countries acupuncture (including moxibustion) has been widely used for the treatment of various gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. However there are no published studies that test treatment protocols using acupuncture or moxibustion on patients with HIV experiencing chronic diarrhea.    ",NCT00010491
HIV,Vaccine (ALVAC-HIV vCP1452) Use and Intermittent Withdrawal of Anti-HIV Drugs in Patients With HIV, Long-term control of HIV depends on improvement in an individual's immune system. The purpose of this study is to see if either stopping anti-HIV drugs for short periods of time and/or adding a vaccine to the anti-HIV drugs being taken will help to better control HIV infection. The study will test whether these treatment approaches are safe. The HIV vaccine in this study has been tested in people who did not have HIV infection and improved the way their immune system worked. This study will evaluate whether these same immune system changes happen in people with HIV and if such changes do occur assess whether these changes help to improve control of HIV in these patients.    ,NCT00011011
HIV,ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 Alone and Combined With MN rgp120, The purpose of this study is to test how the body's immune system responds to the vaccine ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 and to determine if the vaccine is safe when given alone and with MN rgp120. HIV infection and AIDS have no cure in spite of recent advances in anti-HIV drugs. Many worldwide populations cannot afford the antiviral treatments for infected people. HIV vaccines offer hope for disease prevention. In this trial 2 experimental HIV vaccines called ALVAC vCP1452 and MN rgp120 will be given to volunteers in Haiti Brazil Peru and Trinidad and Tobago. The study will determine how volunteers' immune systems respond to the vaccines. (This protocol has been changed by adding new international sites.)    ,NCT00011037
HIV,Effects of Storage on Lactate in Blood Samples, The purpose of this study is to determine whether laboratory storage of samples affects the amount of lactate over 3 years. Lactate is a natural substance normally present in the body. Lactate levels can go up for many different reasons including treatment with nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs. This study will help researchers know if stored blood samples can be used to test lactate levels.    ,NCT00011050
HIV,Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Not Had Success With Other Anti-HIV Drug Combinations, The purpose of this study is to make tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) available to HIV-infected patients who have failed other anti-HIV drug combinations who have few treatment choices available and whose disease may get worse. This study will allow patients to obtain tenofovir DF before it is approved for marketing.    ,NCT00011089
HIV,Salvage Treatment Resistance Testing and Withdrawal of Anti-HIV Drugs for HIV Patients Failing Current Anti-HIV Treatment, The purpose of this study is to test another way to control the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load). Studies show that stopping all anti-HIV drugs for a time before switching to new anti-HIV drugs may improve the response in some individuals who are failing treatment. Other studies suggest a benefit if drug-resistance tests are used in selecting a new anti-HIV drug treatment. This study tests the effect of stopping anti-HIV drugs for a time before switching to anti-HIV drugs selected using drug-resistance test results.    ,NCT00011128
HIV,Blood Levels of Abacavir After One Dose in HIV-Infected Children and Adolescents, The purpose of this study is to measure blood levels of abacavir in children and adolescents over a period of time following a single dose so that a dosage for adolescents can be determined. Little is known about how abacavir is cleared by the body in adolescents. It has been shown that young children require a higher abacavir dose based on weight than adults. Older children or adolescents may not require as high a dose. This study may provide information as to whether the children's dose or the adult dose is better for HIV-infected adolescents.    ,NCT00011479
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of TRIZIVIR (Abacavir/Lamivudine/Zidovudine) With Efavirenz in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Never Taken Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of treatment with Trizivir (TZV) plus efavirenz (EFV) or TZV alone on viral load (level of HIV in the blood).    ,NCT00011895
HIV,Ritonavir and Indinavir in Children Failing Other Anti-HIV Treatment, Both ritonavir (RTV) and indinavir (IDV) are approved by the FDA to treat HIV but IDV has not been approved for use in children and the doses for the combination of the two drugs has not been studied in children. The purpose of this study is to find a combination of RTV and IDV that is safe well tolerated and produces drug levels in the blood of children that are comparable to effective drug levels in the blood of adults. The effectiveness of the drug combination in decreasing the amount of virus in the body will also be studied. The children enrolled in this study will have high HIV viral loads despite taking anti-HIV drugs.    ,NCT00012519
HIV,Comparison of Three Different Initial Treatments Without Protease Inhibitors for HIV Infection, The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness safety and tolerability of 3 anti-HIV combination treatments that do not use protease inhibitors (PIs). The current rule for starting treatment of HIV infection is to combine members from different classes of anti-HIV drugs such as 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and either a PI or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). However these combinations can be complicated and difficult to take can cause a number of side effects and may become ineffective. Combinations that are simpler better tolerated and more effective are needed. Because PIs can cause long-term side effects and because HIV can become resistant to many of them at the same time anti-HIV combination treatments that do not use PIs are being tested.    ,NCT00013520
HIV,HIV Candidate Vaccine ALVAC-HIV-1 Administration in HIV-Negative Adults, The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to administer the candidate HIV vaccine ALVAC HIV-1 (vCP205).    ,NCT00013572
HIV,Immune Therapies and Anti-HIV Therapy Withdrawal in Controlling Viral Load, The purpose of this study is to determine if HIV-specific canarypox vaccine and/or interleukin-2 (IL-2) will control viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) after HIV treatment is withdrawn for a certain time period.    ,NCT00013663
HIV,Pneumococcal Vaccine and Routine Pediatric Immunizations in HIV-Infected Children Receiving Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to determine if 2 doses of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) followed by 1 dose of Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPV) in HIV-infected children on anti-HIV therapy is helpful and safe in fighting pneumococcal infections in this group of children. This study will also look at the protection provided by childhood vaccination against measles pertussis and hepatitis B virus. Pneumococcal infections are the most common AIDS-related infection in HIV-infected children. PCV may help reduce the chances of HIV-infected children getting pneumococcal infections. This study will look at whether pneumococcal vaccines are safe and effective in HIV-infected children receiving HAART. It will look at whether HIV-infected children are protected by childhood vaccines received previously and if more doses are safe and improve protection.    ,NCT00013871
HIV,A Comparison of BMS-232632 With Efavirenz Each in Combination With Zidovudine-Lamivudine, The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of treatment with BMS-232632 to that of efavirenz (EFV) when both are used with zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (3TC).    ,NCT00013897
HIV,Zidovudine and Lamivudine Given Once Versus Twice Daily, The purpose of this study is to see if the full daily dose of Combivir (zidovudine [ZDV]/lamivudine [3TC]) taken once a day is as effective as the usual recommended twice-a-day dose. Studies have shown that the antiviral activity of ZDV can continue in the body even after there does not appear to be any ZDV left in the blood. This occurs because the body breaks down the drug into substances that remain active against HIV. The body also breaks down 3TC a drug that is combined with ZDV in the Combivir product in a similar way. Since antiviral activity may continue after Combivir is removed from the body it may not be necessary to take the drug as often as once thought. This study carefully measures levels of the active substances in order to find out whether the same amount of antiviral activity occurs with less-frequent dosing.    ,NCT00014014
HIV,A Study of Immune System Activity in Healthy Adults, The purpose of this study is to compare immune system activity in young people and older people who do not have HIV. This information will be compared to that of HIV patients in another study. Aging affects immune system activity. This study will look at some of the factors involved. HIV also affects immune system activity. The results from this study using healthy volunteers will be compared to those in another study of HIV-infected patients. This may provide information on immune system activity in aging and HIV.    ,NCT00014053
HIV,Simplified Drug Regimens for HIV Patients in ACTG 388 or Patients Who Responded to A First Potent Combination Regimen, ACTG 388 was a clinical trial that compared three- and four-drug anti-HIV drug regimens and demonstrated the effectiveness of a three-drug regimen. This study will compare the ability of two different three-drug anti-HIV drug regimens to reduce levels of HIV in the blood. The study will also evaluate whether patients discontinue the regimens because of drug side effects.    ,NCT00014937
HIV,Interleukin-2 (IL-2) Pegylated Interferon (PEG-IFN Alfa-2b) and Ribavirin (RBV) Treatment in Patients With Hepatitis C and HIV Coinfection," This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a new treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) in patients who also have HIV. The usual treatment for HCV in people who are not HIV-infected is interferon-alfa (IFN) with ribavirin (RBV) an approved treatment by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study will use a new longer acting form of IFN called PEG-IFN alfa-2b. PEG-IFN alfa-2b is approved by the FDA for use in treating HCV but has not yet been approved for use with RBV. This study also will use IL-2 which is a substance that the body naturally produces. People with HIV infection usually do not make enough IL-2. IL-2 is being tested in this study to see if it will ""boost"" the immune system's response to HCV. The FDA has approved IL-2 for the treatment of some cancers.    ",NCT00015652
HIV,Metformin and Rosiglitazone Alone or in Combination in HIV-Infected Patients With Insulin and Fat Abnormalities, The purpose of this study is to see whether metformin alone rosiglitazone alone or metformin and rosiglitazone together will lower insulin levels in the blood and decrease fat in the abdomen or other parts of the body. Studies have shown that certain anti-HIV medications can cause a number of side effects including high blood sugar (resulting from the body's failure to use insulin) high insulin and excess fat build-up in the abdominal area. These side effects are known to increase the risk of heart disease. Metformin and rosiglitazone are 2 drugs that have been shown to lower insulin resistance and lessen abdominal fat in patients who are not HIV-infected. This study will investigate the use of these drugs in HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT00015691
HIV,Effect of Interleukin-2 on HIV Treatment Interruption, Interleukin-2 (IL-2) helps the body make infection-fighting white blood cells including CD4 and CD8 T cells. One HIV treatment strategy is planned treatment interruption (stopping anti-HIV drugs when CD4 count and level of virus in the blood are at certain levels). The purpose of this study is to see if IL-2 used with potent anti-HIV drugs allows for longer HIV treatment interruptions.    ,NCT00015704
HIV,Effects of BufferGel and PRO 2000/5 Gel in Men, The purpose of this study is to find out if there are any bad effects when BufferGel or PRO 2000/5 Gel are applied to the penis of HIV-infected men. Microbicides are products to be used by women for placing into the vagina to prevent passing HIV from 1 person to another during sex. Studies have shown 2 investigational microbicides BufferGel and PRO 2000/5 Gel to be safe and acceptable for women and HIV-negative men. It is important to see if the side effects of these products are the same in men as those in women and to see if there is any difference in the side effects between circumcised and uncircumcised men.    ,NCT00016536
HIV,Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) in HIV-1 Patients Who Have Never Taken Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in HIV-infected patients who have never taken anti-HIV drugs.    ,NCT00016588
HIV,Depo-Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA Depo-Provera) Use With Certain Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-Infected Women, The purpose of this study is to look at the level of depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA or Depo-Provera) in the blood to see if is affected by certain anti-HIV drugs (nelfinavir [NFV] efavirenz [EFV] indinavir [IDV] in combination with ritonavir [RTV] and nevirapine [NVP]). This study will also look at the levels of these anti-HIV drugs to see if they are affected by DMPA. DMPA is a hormonal birth control method that is given as an injection. It is not known if taking DMPA together with anti-HIV drugs changes the amount of DMPA and/or the amount of anti-HIV drugs in the blood. If higher levels of DMPA occur side effects may increase. If lower levels of anti-HIV drugs occur the drugs may become less effective against HIV. This study will look at the levels of anti-HIV drugs and DMPA in the blood when these medications are used together.    ,NCT00016601
HIV,Safety and Tolerability of Z-100 in Patients With Early HIV Infection, The purpose of the study is to see if Z-100 (an investigational drug) treatment is safe in HIV patients who have never received treatment for their HIV who have not been taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 8 weeks or who have been stable on their current first or second HAART regimen for at least 12 weeks.    ,NCT00016692
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Emtricitabine Efavirenz and Didanosine in HIV Infected Children Who Have Taken Few or No Anti-HIV Drugs, Treatment of HIV-infected patients involves combining drugs from different classes of anti-HIV drugs. One preferred regimen for adults is 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and 1 protease inhibitor (PI). For children this regimen may be too complicated or the drugs may be too difficult to take by mouth. The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of daily didanosine (ddI) efavirenz (EFV) and emtricitabine (FTC) in pediatric patients who have taken few or no anti-HIV drugs.    ,NCT00016718
HIV,Stopping and Restarting Anti-HIV Drugs in Children and Adolescents With Low Blood Levels of HIV, Some patients taking anti-HIV drugs as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) do not show any HIV in the blood; however some HIV will remain hidden in the body and if the drugs are stopped will return to the blood. The purpose of this study is to determine if short periods of stopping HAART increase the activity of CD8 and CD4 cells (cells of the immune system that fight infection) if repeated stopping of these drugs for longer periods of time and restarting them will increase effectiveness of HAART and if the increased immune system activity as a result of stopping treatment leads to lower levels of HIV over time.    ,NCT00016783
HIV,Combination Treatment With and Without Protease Inhibitors for Women Who Begin Therapy for HIV Infection During Pregnancy, The best anti-HIV treatment regimen for pregnant women is not known. Protease inhibitors (PIs) are often used but they have side effects that may be harmful for pregnant women. It is not known if treatment regimens that do not include PIs are as effective in pregnant women as those that include PIs. This trial will compare two anti-HIV treatment plans one with and one without PIs in women who start HIV treatment during pregnancy. The study will evaluate the effects of the anti-HIV drugs on the developing infant and prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission during pregnancy.    ,NCT00017719
HIV,The Effect of Efavirenz and Nelfinavir on the Blood Levels of Certain Lipid-Lowering Drugs, The purpose of this study is to find out whether certain anti-HIV drugs (efavirenz [EFV] and nelfinavir [NFV]) affect the amount of certain fat-lowering drugs (atorvastatin pravastatin and simvastatin) in the blood. Protease inhibitors (PIs) a type of anti-HIV drug are known to cause increased lipids (fats) in the blood of HIV-infected patients. EFV also is known to increase blood fats. HIV-infected patients who take PIs and/or EFV may need to take fat-lowering drugs to correct this problem. So it is important to look at possible drug interactions when these drugs are taken together. This study will see if taking EFV or NFV a protease inhibitor affects the blood level of simvastatin atorvastatin or pravastatin (all fat-lowering drugs). To obtain results more quickly the study population will be healthy HIV-negative volunteers.    ,NCT00017758
HIV,Nerve Damage in Patients With HIV Infection Who Have Been Treated With Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to find out what might increase nerve damage in people with HIV who have taken drugs for treatment of HIV disease. Another purpose is to see if nerve exams are done correctly before clinical research sites enroll HIV-infected patients. Nerve damage is common in patients with HIV infection and can cause serious problems. The factors that place patients at risk are not well understood. This study will examine these factors in patients with advanced HIV infection and who have been taking anti-HIV drugs.    ,NCT00017771
HIV,Problems Associated With the Use of Anti-HIV Drugs in HIV-Infected Pregnant Women, The purpose of this study is to find out if HIV-infected pregnant women who take protease inhibitors (PIs) are more likely to have blood sugar problems than those who do not take PIs. HIV-infected people generally are treated with a combination of different types of anti-HIV drugs 1 of which is usually a PI. The same holds true for pregnant women but not much is known about the use of these drugs in pregnancy. Blood sugar and liver problems caused by anti-HIV drugs in nonpregnant patients are well known but their effects in pregnancy are not. Also certain physical changes brought about by pregnancy may affect the way drugs are handled in the body. There remains a need for further study into the use of anti-HIV drugs during pregnancy and their effect on the safety of the mother and baby.    ,NCT00017797
HIV,Acupressure to Treat Nausea and Vomiting in HIV/AIDS Patients, The purpose of this study is to see whether acupressure (acupuncture using pressure applied by the hands instead of needles) can help nausea and vomiting in persons with HIV/AIDS.    ,NCT00017823
HIV,Emtricitabine Given Once A Day With Other Anti-HIV Drugs in Children With HIV, The purpose of this study is to see if emtricitabine is safe in children infected with HIV and to determine the best dose.    ,NCT00017992
HIV,Changing to Nonprotease Inhibitor Treatment to Improve Side Effects, The purpose of this study is to learn whether changing from a type of anti-HIV drug called a protease inhibitor (PI) to another type of anti-HIV drug will help to lower the amount of fats or sugars in the blood. PIs have been effective at keeping HIV viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) down. However some people who take PIs have higher than normal levels of fats and/or sugars in the blood. Doctors believe that switching to anti-HIV drugs that do not contain PIs will improve the abnormal side effects. This study will test 3 different combinations of non-PI drugs to see which may improve side effects while keeping viral loads low.    ,NCT00021463
HIV,Mycophenolate Mofetil and Abacavir Treatment in HIV Patients With Failed Anti-HIV Treatment, The purpose of this study is to learn how safe and well-tolerated mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is when given with abacavir (ABC). Another purpose is to see if adding MMF to ABC decreases viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) more than ABC alone. Many HIV-infected patients who have had heavy exposure to anti-HIV drugs and have experienced treatment failure need new treatment combinations. One promising combination is ABC and MMF as part of a drug combination. Laboratory studies show that MMF helps ABC destroy HIV in the cells and further clinical testing is needed. MMF is not FDA-approved as a treatment for HIV infection but has been approved by FDA to prevent rejection of organ transplants. Doses of MMF tested in this study will be lower than those used to treat people with organ transplants.    ,NCT00021489
HIV,T-20 in HIV Patients With Prior Drug Treatment and/or Resistance to Each of the Three Classes of Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to show if a dose of T-20 added to an anti-HIV combination (chosen specifically for each patient) lowers viral load by at least a certain level after 24 weeks as compared to an anti-HIV combination (chosen specifically for each patient) alone. Another purpose is to show if the patient response to T-20 will be maintained for 48 weeks.    ,NCT00021554
HIV,Effects of Ribavirin on Zidovudine or Stavudine, The purpose of this study is to see how treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) patients with ribavirin (RBV) affects the anti-HIV drugs stavudine (d4T) or zidovudine (ZDV). Studies have shown that RBV may interfere with the action of ZDV and d4T. There is little information about the way these drugs interact in the body. This study will examine how the drug RBV affects levels of ZDV or d4T in patients who are currently on stable anti-HIV therapy.    ,NCT00021632
HIV,Antibiotics to Reduce Chorioamnionitis-Related Perinatal HIV Transmission, The purpose of this study is to see if antibiotic drugs given to treat an infection of the uterus during pregnancy can reduce the chances of HIV being passed from an HIV-positive mother to her baby. A link between bacterial disease of the vagina premature birth infection of the uterus during pregnancy and the passing of HIV from a mother to her baby has been found. Early treatment of these problems may reduce the risk of passing HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her baby. [Note: As of 02/21/03 enrollment into this study was halted because preliminary data showed that the study antibiotics were not effective in preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission.]    ,NCT00021671
HIV,Effects of Immunization With HIV-1 Immunogen Plus Anti-HIV Treatment Interruption on the Levels of HIV, The purpose of this study is to see whether or not an HIV vaccination will help the body control the amount of HIV virus in blood (viral load) in patients who are not taking anti-HIV medicines. Doctors are not sure why the body fails to control HIV viral load in most people infected with HIV. The vaccine Remune has been shown to boost part of the body's immune response to HIV in patients whose viral load has been lowered with anti-HIV drugs. This study will test the ability of Remune to improve the body's immune response and to lower HIV viral load in patients who stop taking anti-HIV drugs for short periods of time.    ,NCT00021762
HIV,HIV Prevention Preparedness Study in Russia China and India, The purpose of this study is to set up a system for doing research on HIV prevention in various parts of the world. In order to plan large long-term studies on the prevention of HIV in different areas of the world it is necessary to get certain information first. It is important to know about the rate of HIV infection and how to get people to enroll for any future studies. This study will be done at 4 study locations.    ,NCT00021775
HIV,T-20 Plus a Selected Anti-HIV Treatment in HIV-Infected Children and Adolescents, This study will evaluate T-20 in children.    ,NCT00022763
HIV,Lamivudine and Adefovir to Treat Chronic Hepatitis B Infection in People With and Without HIV Infection, This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of adefovir plus lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B infection in people with and without HIV infection. Lamuvidine an FDA-approved treatment for hepatitis B infection also works against HIV. In some patients the hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues to reproduce despite lamivudine treatment. Adefovir is an experimental drug that inhibits HBV replication and may work against some strains of the virus that have become resistant to lamivudine. Patients 21 years of age or older with active hepatitis B infection despite treatment with lamivudine for at least 1 year may be eligible for this 48-week study. Patients both with or without HIV infection may participate. Candidates will be screened with a medical history blood and urine tests liver ultrasound exam electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest X-ray. Participants will have a physical examination review of their medical history blood tests and a 24-hour urine collection. They will be admitted to the hospital for a liver biopsy to determine if they can receive the study drug. For this procedure the patient is given a sedative for relaxation. The skin over the biopsy is numbed with an anesthetic and the biopsy needle is passed rapidly into and out of the liver to collect a tissue specimen. Patients are monitored in the hospital overnight for possible complications. After discharge they return home and begin taking the study medications. Patients will be randomized to two treatment groups. One group will take 10 milligrams/day of adefovir by mouth and the other will take a placebo-a lookalike pill with no active ingredient. Both groups will also take 150 mg lamivudine by mouth and L-carnitine pills or liquid. Patients with HIV infection will continue to take antiretroviral therapy as well. Patients will be followed in the clinic at study weeks 2 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 and 44 for blood and urine tests to determine the safety of the drug and to evaluate the response to treatment. On week 48 a repeat 24-hour urine test and repeat liver biopsy will be done. At the end of the 48 weeks patients may continue to receive adefovir for another 48 weeks and possibly longer. All those who participate in this extension phase will receive active adefovir regardless of whether they had previously taken adefovir or placebo. All patients will have the option to enroll in a separate study to examine the levels of HBV (and levels of HIV in HIV-infected patients) in the blood immediately after starting treatment and to determine if these initial levels can predict later outcome. This involves seven additional visits for which participants will be compensated. At these visits blood will be drawn on study days 0 (before starting drug treatment) 1 3 5 7 10 and 21 for HIV and HBV viral loads and specialized immunology tests.    ,NCT00023153
HIV,Effect of a Change in HIV Therapy on Liver Steatosis Inflammation and Fibrosis, The purpose of this study is to look at how 2 different anti-HIV drug treatments affect the liver. The use of anti-HIV drugs like the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) may be linked to liver problems like fatty changes scarring abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and lactic acidemia (an increase in lactic acid in the blood). Increased liver enzymes may mean liver damage. The way that the liver changes in people with abnormal LFTs and lactic acidemia is not completely understood.    ,NCT00023218
HIV,TBTC Study 23A: Pharmacokinetics of Intermittent Isoniazid and Rifabutin in HIV-TB, Primary Objectives: 1) To determine the proportion of patients with HIV-related tuberculosis who have abnormal pharmacokinetic parameters for isoniazid and rifabutin. Secondary Objectives:   1. To determine risk factors for abnormal pharmacokinetic parameters for isoniazid and rifabutin.   2. To evaluate the correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters of isoniazid and rifabutin and the occurrence of toxicity attributed to antituberculous therapy.   3. To evaluate the correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters of isoniazid and rifabutin and the efficacy of TB therapy.   4. To define and correlate phenotypic INH acetylator status with the results of genotypic acetylator data obtained in the parent trial.    ,NCT00023348
HIV,TBTC Study 23: Treatment of HIV-Related Tuberculosis Using a Rifabutin-Based Regimen, Primary objective: To determine the rate of confirmed treatment failure and relapse with an intermittent rifabutin-based regimen for the treatment of isoniazid and rifamycin-susceptible HIV-related tuberculosis (TB).    ,NCT00023361
HIV,TBTC Study 23B:Intensive PK of the Nelfinavir Rifabutin Interaction in Patients With HIV-TB, Primary Objective: To define the impact of nelfinavir (given at 1250mg bid as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen) on peak levels and area under the curve for rifabutin and the rifabutin metabolite 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin when rifabutin is given at 300 mg bi-weekly as part of tuberculosis chemotherapy. Secondary Objectives: To compare the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir given twice daily at 1250 mg bid with twice-weekly isoniazid and rifabutin to the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir 1250 mg twice-daily in historical HIV-infected patients not receiving isoniazid and rifabutin. To evaluate the correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters of rifabutin and 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin and the occurrence of toxicity attributed to rifabutin in patients with HIV-related tuberculosis. To define detailed pharmacokinetics of isoniazid given at 15mg/kg or 900 mg in patients with HIV-related tuberculosis. To attempt to derive optimal sampling times for nelfinavir and rifabutin pharmacokinetic studies.    ,NCT00023400
HIV,TBTC Study 23C: Pharmacokinetics of Intermittent Rifabutin and Isoniazid With Daily Efavirenz, The aim of this trial is to study the efavirenz-rifabutin interaction. Thus this trial will enroll patients with HIV and tuberculosis co-infections who are receiving a rifabutin-based regimen and who plan to begin an antiretroviral regimen containing efavirenz dosed at 600 mg daily. Enrollment in TB Trials Consortium Study 23 is not a requirement for participation in this study. Primary Objective: To compare the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin at 600 mg twice a week in combination with efavirenz 600 mg daily to the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin 300 mg twice a week without efavirenz.    ,NCT00023413
HIV,HIV and Genital Herpes Among High-Risk Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM) in Lima Peru, The purpose of this study is to provide biomedical and behavioral information that is necessary for planning and starting HIV prevention trials in Lima Peru. The occurrence of HIV is high among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Lima Peru and bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HSV-2 (genital herpes) are very prevalent in HIV-positive and -negative MSM there. Methods to reduce both HIV and STDs are urgently needed among MSM in Peru. The information gained from this study is very important for future HIV prevention and vaccine trials that will take place in Peru.    ,NCT00023582
HIV,Comparison of Two Dosing Regimens of GW433908/Ritonavir Versus Lopinavir/Ritonavir for 48 Weeks in HIV Patients Who Have Taken Protease Inhibitors and Experienced Virological Failure, The purpose of this study is to test 2 different dosing regimens of GW433908/ritonavir (RTV) versus lopinavir (LPV)/RTV when each is given with 2 active reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) in patients who have taken anti-HIV drugs without success.    ,NCT00025727
HIV,Rosiglitazone and Exercise Training: Effects on HIV-Infected People With Insulin Resistance Hypertriglyceridemia and Adipose Tissue Maldistribution, Several complications have become prevalent in people living with HIV/AIDS including increased blood sugar increased blood fats and cholesterol and fat tissue redistribution. The causes of these complications are not well understood and effective treatments have not been identified. We propose to test the efficacy and safety of 2 treatments for these complications in people living with HIV/AIDS: aerobic weight lifting exercise training and a new insulin-sensitizing agent called rosiglitazone (Avandia). Exercise and rosiglitazone have been effective and moderately safe when used in HIV-seronegative people with diabetes but a specific trial is needed to test efficacy and safety in people living with HIV/AIDS.    ,NCT00025753
HIV,Safety/Immunogenicity of Immunizations of ALVAC-DC-SC vs ALVAC-SC, The purpose of this study is to determine how safe it is to give patients a shot that has a mixture of a vaccine and dendritic cells (DCs) a special kind of immune cell and how safe it is to give a shot of the vaccine alone. Current HIV vaccines have not been strong enough to give good immune responses. Research has shown that the immune response to a vaccine delivered by DCs is greater than the response without DC delivery. A5130 is a study that seeks to give good delivery of the vaccine to important immune cells of the body.    ,NCT00026624
HIV,Use of a Test That Evaluates How the Body Handles Insulin and Glucose, The purpose of this study is to find out if testosterone gel affects how the body handles insulin and glucose. Specific anti-HIV treatments may increase a patient's risk of certain diseases by causing metabolic problems such as reduced sensitivity to insulin. This substudy will examine how testosterone affects insulin sensitivity. If testosterone increases insulin sensitivity in the patients then giving testosterone to HIV-infected patients may allow the continuation of anti-HIV treatments without increasing the patients' risk of disease. The test used to determine insulin sensitivity will be a modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) which can accurately measure insulin sensitivity.    ,NCT00027092
HIV,Safety and Immune Response Study of High-Dose Canarypox ALVAC-HIV Vaccine in Healthy HIV Uninfected Adults, The purpose of this study is to see if the experimental vaccine ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452) is safe and to study how the immune system responds to the vaccine. This trial is designed to determine whether a higher vaccine dose (6 times the usual dose) will elicit a higher immune response. As of May 2001 over 200 people received the ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452) vaccine at the lower dose. The higher dose of the vaccine to be used in this study has not been given to humans previously. High doses of a similar vaccine have been given to a few people without serious side effects. In a recent study done in mice higher doses of ALVAC-HIV produced stronger immune responses. It is possible that the doses of ALVAC-HIV given to humans are below the amount needed for the maximum immune response. Because the exact relationship between an increased immune response and its effectiveness in preventing HIV infection is uncertain the HVTN will use the highest dose that can be manufactured.    ,NCT00027261
HIV,Using Drug Levels and Drug Resistance Testing to Select Effective Anti-HIV Drug Combinations in Patients With Drug-resistant HIV, Because people infected with HIV strains that are resistant to anti-HIV drugs have fewer effective treatment options selecting an effective anti-HIV drug combination is difficult. A combination of protease inhibitors (PIs) when added to a patient's current anti-HIV therapy may decrease viral load and increase drug activity. Tests that measure drug levels in the blood and tests to evaluate the drug resistance of HIV may also be helpful in choosing the best anti-HIV drug combination for a patient. This study will determine whether using these tests to choose a drug combination and adding PIs to that combination will improve the patient's response to anti-HIV therapy.    ,NCT00027339
HIV,A Comparison of Two Ways to Manage Anti-HIV Treatment (The SMART Study), The purpose of this study is to compare two ways of using anti-HIV drugs to help health care providers and patients decide how to best use anti-HIV treatments over many years. Many health care providers now treat patients with daily drugs to keep the viral load as low as possible. This approach helps patients with CD4 counts less than 200-250 cells/mm3 live longer without serious diseases. But it is not known if this is the best way to treat patients with higher CD4 counts. There is information suggesting that these patients may be able to wait to use anti-HIV drugs while CD4 counts are above 250 cells/mm3. Because this study will be carried out over several years it will provide information on the long-term advantages and disadvantages of these two treatment strategies.    ,NCT00027352
HIV,An Investigational Combination Vaccine Given to People Who Are Not Infected With HIV, The purpose of this study is to see if the investigational vaccines NefTat and gp120w61d are safe and tolerable in humans and to see how the immune system responds to the vaccines. There have been advances in the treatment and prevention of HIV but the spread of HIV/AIDS is getting worse. HIV/AIDS is the main infectious cause of death in the world. A vaccine to prevent HIV disease is the best way to try to deal with this situation. Several vaccine products have been tested but only 2 are still in trial. There is a need for a new product.    ,NCT00027365
HIV,A Comparison of Atazanavir and Nelfinavir Each in Combination With 2 NRTIs in Patients Who Have Failed Treatments Without a Protease Inhibitor, The purpose of this study is to compare the atazanavir and nelfinavir (NFV) treatments in their ability to reduce viral load.    ,NCT00028067
HIV,HIV Incidence and Participation Retention in Pune India, The purpose of this study is to ensure that the HIV Prevention Trials Unit (HPTU) in Pune will be able to enroll and retain participants for 2 upcoming HPTN clinical trials. Specifically this study seeks to find the rate of HIV infection and follow-up among a group of high-risk HIV-negative non-sexworker women in Pune as well as among HIV-discordant couples (couples where 1 partner is HIV-infected and the other is not). Phase III studies of HIV prevention require the participation of a large number of people at high risk for HIV infection. It is also important that these participants continue and follow through with the study through the extended period of follow-up. A measurement of HIV incidence and retention rate among high-risk women and HIV-discordant couples is necessary for upcoming HPTN trials. Taken together with the need for estimates of HIV incidence and the need for data to ensure high retention rates this protocol is important for the HPTN generally and for HPTU in Pune in particular.    ,NCT00028119
HIV,Safety and Acceptability of the Anti-Microbe Vaginal Gel PMPA Gel, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the PMPA gel which kills microbes in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women. The majority of new HIV infections occur through heterosexual contact. A product that stops or slows the replication of HIV during sexual contact is needed. At present there are no products that are completely effective. PMPA gel also known as tenofovir is an anti-microbe agent that may fight against sexual transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It is applied to the vagina and gives women the ability to control their disease-prevention activity.    ,NCT00028132
HIV,Prenatal and Postnatal Studies of Interventions for Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission, The purpose of this study is to collect and study clinical and laboratory information about a pregnant or new mother and her medical care that will increase our knowledge of the best care for HIV-infected pregnant women and their children. The rate of transmission of HIV from mothers to their infants has gone down. Specific U.S. Public Health Service guidelines recommend that HIV-infected pregnant women be treated with anti-HIV therapies; but the effectiveness of treatment and safety for the mother and her infant have not been fully examined. This study will monitor the health of women and their infants while they receive anti-HIV therapy. Also this study will provide information that may be used for future studies.    ,NCT00028145
HIV,Atazanavir Versus Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/RTV) in Patients Who Have Not Had Success With Protease Inhibitor-Containing HAART Regimen(s), This study will compare 2 treatments in the way they affect cholesterol levels and the amount of HIV in the blood.    ,NCT00028301
HIV,Effects of Treatment Changes on Fat Wasting in the Arms and Legs of HIV Patients, The goals of this study are to find out if fat wasting and weight loss in the arms and legs of HIV patients taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are caused by nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and if wasting can be reversed if the NRTI is stopped and replaced with other anti-HIV drugs.    ,NCT00028314
HIV,Potent Antiviral Therapy for Critically Ill HIV Infected Patients Admitted to Intensive Care, Many HIV infected patients admitted to the intensive care area (ICA) have never taken anti-HIV drugs. The purpose of this study is to learn whether starting anti-HIV drugs while patients are in an ICA will help them to survive and get better faster. This study will also evaluate patients who though not in an ICA have been admitted to the hospital for serious illnesses or infections.    ,NCT00028327
HIV,Dual Versus Triple Protease Inhibitor Combinations Including Ritonavir in HIV Infected People, Ritonavir (RTV) is a protease inhibitor (PI) commonly used to increase drug levels of other PIs in HIV drug treatment. The purpose of this study is to compare a combination of drugs which includes RTV and 2 protease inhibitors (PIs) with 2 combinations that include RTV and another PI. This study also will compare the effectiveness safety tolerability and drug levels in the blood of these anti-HIV drug combinations.    ,NCT00028366
HIV,Alternative Stress Management Approaches in HIV Disease, The overall purpose of the proposed study is to determine whether three short-term stress management interventions along with booster strategies will improve and sustain improvements in psychosocial functioning quality of life and somatic health among persons with varying stages of HIV disease. The 10-week group interventions are designed to reduce perceived stress and increase coping effectiveness and include cognitive-behavioral stress management focused on positively living (+LIVE) focused Tai Chi (TCHI) training and spiritual growth groups (SPRT). Effects of the interventions will be evaluated immediately upon completion of the group training and at 6 months and 12 months following stress management training.    ,NCT00029237
HIV,Garlic in Hyperlipidemia Caused by HAART, The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and tolerability of garlic pills in lowering cholesterol and triglycerides in hyperlipidemic HIV-infected individuals who are being treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).    ,NCT00029250
HIV,A Study to Demonstrate That Anti-HIV Drug Therapy Can be Stopped Without Causing Viral Resistance and to Characterize Drug Elimination From the Body, The purpose of this study is to find out if anti-HIV drugs can be stopped without the virus becoming resistant to the drugs. The study will also examine how fast anti-HIV drugs leave the body. Not all HIV-infected patients may require continuous and indefinite anti-HIV therapy. There is evidence that stopping anti-HIV therapy will not make the virus resistant to efavirenz (EFV) an anti-HIV drug that remains in the body longer than most treatment drugs. In another study patients were treated with EFV zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (3TC). The patients' virus was controlled despite the fact that some patients missed medication dosages. Many patients stop anti-HIV therapy because of negative effects. This study will examine the body's ability to fight and control virus in patients who stop therapy.    ,NCT00029341
HIV,A Study to Prepare for Future HIV Vaccine Studies, The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of HVTN sites to recruit and retain people at risk for HIV infection for possible future HIV vaccine research studies. This study also aims to learn more about the risk behaviors of people at high risk for HIV infection. In order for studies to be successful study sites must be able to recruit enroll retain and inform groups at high risk for HIV infection. The plan for Phase III HIV vaccine trials will depend on the number of participants enrolled the rate at which participants become HIV-infected the length of follow-up and the number of participants who continue and follow through with the entire study. At existing sites it is necessary to evaluate the potential to recruit new groups. At possible expansion sites work is necessary to establish effective procedures to recruit and retain participants and to identify HIV incidence rates. This study will accomplish those goals.    ,NCT00029744
HIV,A Study of Patients Who Develop HIV Infection After Enrolling in HIV Vaccine Trials or HIV Vaccine Preparedness Trials, Despite risk reduction counseling some individuals in HIV vaccine trials or vaccine preparedness studies may engage in risk behavior that results in HIV infection. The purpose of the HVTN 403 study is to find out more about how persons respond to HIV infection if they have received an experimental HIV-1 vaccine before they became HIV infected. Some people in HVTN 403 received an experimental HIV vaccine as a participant in a clinical trial before getting infected with HIV. Other people in this study were in a vaccine preparedness study when they got infected with HIV. None of these individuals became infected with HIV as result of their participation in an HIV vaccine or vaccine preparedness study. HVTN 403 will compare immune responses between those who previously received an experimental HIV vaccine and those who did not. Information learned from this study may be important in guiding future developments of new HIV vaccines and other treatments for HIV and AIDS.    ,NCT00029913
HIV,Adding New Drugs for HIV Infected Patients Failing Current Therapy, Even though powerful anti-HIV drug combinations have been successful in patients with little or no prior anti-HIV therapy studies have shown that these treatments are less effective in patients who have been treated with nucleoside analogues. This study will test the safety and effectiveness of adding one or two new drugs to a personalized anti-HIV regimen for patients whose previous HIV treatments have failed.    ,NCT00031044
HIV,Vitamin B Therapy for Hyperlactatemia, The purpose of this study is to see if vitamin B can treat mild hyperlactatemia (a higher than normal level of lactate in the blood) in patients who take nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Hyperlactatemia is a potentially life-threatening condition that can be associated with NRTI therapy. A lack of vitamin B may be related to the development of hyperlactatemia. However no studies have been done to evaluate this. This study proposes that high doses of vitamin B may bring elevated lactate levels back to normal among patients taking NRTIs.    ,NCT00031057
HIV,Increasing HAART-Induced Immune Restoration With Cyclosporine, The purpose of this study is to see if cyclosporine taken when a patient begins highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) increases the number of CD4 T-cells (blood cells that fight infection) in a patient's blood. This study also will explore the safety of briefly giving cyclosporine to patients starting HAART.    ,NCT00031070
HIV,The Effectiveness of Human Antibodies in Influencing an AIDS-Like Disease in Monkeys, The purpose of this study is to see if an investigational vaccine can make antibodies (proteins found in blood) in humans that will influence the course of an AIDS-like disease in monkeys. Hopefully the results of this study can be applied to humans. AIDS which is caused by infection with HIV is associated with many deaths and occurrences of disease. Although recent advances have been made in anti-HIV therapy for AIDS there is no cure for HIV infection or AIDS and drug therapy is too expensive for most infected populations. Some organizations are trying to make safe and effective vaccines that may prevent HIV infection and AIDS worldwide. Certain vaccines can generate specific antibodies in humans but they do not inhibit HIV infection in laboratory tests. It is possible however that these antibodies may make HIV disease less severe following infection. For this reason monkeys will be used to evaluate the role of specific human antibodies.    ,NCT00031109
HIV,The Impact of HAART on Response to Hepatitis C Treatment in Patients Taking Peginterferon Alpha-2b and Ribavirin, This study will evaluate how controlling HIV infection with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) affects the response to hepatitis C treatment with peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C. HIV worsens liver disease caused by hepatitis C. Since treatment of HIV infection with HAART improves immune function it may be beneficial to start HAART before treating HCV. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis C infection may be eligible for this study. Patients must have an HCV viral load greater than 2000 copies/mL and a CD4 count that is either more than 500 cells/mm3 or more than 350 cells/mm3 with an HIV viral load no greater than 40000 particles/mL. Candidates will be screened for current or previous diseases conditions or treatments that may exclude them from this study. Screening includes a medical history and physical examination eye examination blood and urine tests chest X-ray electrocardiogram (EKG) liver ultrasound and possibly a liver biopsy if a recent one is not available. The liver biopsy is optional and is done to determine the severity of liver disease. Patients will be sedated for this test. The skin in the area over the biopsy site is numbed with a local anesthetic and a needle is inserted rapidly into and out of the liver to obtain a small tissue sample. Patients remain in the hospital overnight for monitoring. Women of childbearing age will have a pregnancy test. Patients enrolled in the study will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: 1) pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks (control group); or 2) HAART for 6 months followed by 48 weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. HAART group - Patients taking HAART will be followed in the clinic every 2 weeks for the first month and then monthly for the next 5 months. After 6 months of HAART they will begin taking pegylated interferon and ribavirin and will follow the dosing and follow-up schedule outlined below for patients in the control group. Control group - Patients will have weekly injections under the skin of peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin pills daily by mouth. Clinic visits will be scheduled as follows:   -  Days 1 3 7 and 21 - Blood will be drawn for safety tests and to measure blood levels of HIV and HCV. HCV medications will be injected on days 7 and 21.   -  Weeks 2 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 52 56 and 64 - Blood and urine tests will be done to determine the side effects of pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment and its effect on the HCV infection. Eye examinations will be done every 3 months.   -  Week 48 or end of treatment - Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin will stop after 48 weeks. At this time (or earlier for those who do not complete the 48 weeks of treatment) patients will return to the clinic for a routine visit blood tests (including a test for hepatitis B) and abdominal ultrasound. Patients may also be hospitalized for 2 days for a repeat optional liver biopsy.   -  Week 72 and extended follow-up visits - At week 72 patients will return for blood tests and a routine clinic visit. HCV viral load will be measured. Follow-up visits every 3 months for an additional year will include a blood test to measure HCV viral load and a complete physical examination.    ,NCT00031343
HIV,Consent for Use of Stored Patient Specimens for Future Testing, The purpose of this study is to obtain informed consent to use stored human biological materials (HBM) (e.g. blood and other tissues) for future studies that may include genetic testing.    ,NCT00031408
HIV,Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Viral Resistance Testing in the Treatment of HIV-Infected Children, This study will evaluate a new treatment strategy called therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in HIV-infected children and adolescents. TDM involves analyzing the virus giving drugs the virus is most sensitive to monitoring drug blood levels to make sure there is enough drug to work against the virus and changing the drug dose if it is too low. HIV-infected children between 0 and 21 years of age who may benefit from treatment with a protease inhibitor and who are not benefiting from their current antiretroviral drug treatment regimen may be enrolled in this 48-week study. Patients who are not currently receiving antiretroviral treatment including patients who have never received antiretroviral treatment may be enrolled in the study. Participants will have blood drawn to learn what anti-HIV drugs the patient's virus is resistant to-that is what drugs are no longer effective against the virus. This is determined by analyzing the virus's genotype (detailed genetic structure) and phenotype (response to exposure to anti-viral drugs). Based on these test results and the patient's prior medication history a drug regimen tailored to the individual patient will be prescribed. It may include one or two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as zidovudine didanosine lamuvidine zalcitabine stavudine) a non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor such as nevirapine or efavirenz and a protease inhibitor such as amprenavir nelfinavir saquinavir ritonavir or Kaletra (a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir). After the patients begin treatment the amount of the protease inhibitor in the blood will be measured. If not enough of the drug is found in the blood the dose of the drug will be increased and the amount of the drug in the blood will be checked again. In this study the dose may be increased up to three times. Patients will be seen in clinic for 6 days when treatment begins to measure blood levels of the medicines and evaluate the response of the virus. Treatment will then continue on an outpatient basis. Drug levels will be measured periodically throughout the study. The viral load will also be measured and additional tests to determine whether the resistance pattern of the patients' virus has changed. In addition patients will undergo the following tests and procedures at various times throughout the study more frequently for the first few months and then less often:   -  Blood tests to measure cell counts and viral load   -  Routine laboratory tests to measure kidney liver bone marrow and other organ functioning   -  Eye and neuropsychologic examinations   -  Echocardiogram (heart ultrasound)   -  Electrocardiogram (EKG - heart rhythm test)   -  Chest X-ray   -  Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head   -  Skin tests To make sure the medicines work they must be taken as directed. In addition since higher than usual doses of some of the anti-HIV drugs may be given it will be important to know whether the patients are taking all of the medicine that has been prescribed. This study will therefore also measure patients' adherence to their medication regimen in two ways: 1) some medicines will be packaged in a bottle with an electronic medicine bottle cap that will record when the bottle is opened and 2) patients and their parents will be interviewed by phone or in person at various times during the study about adherence and may be asked to fill out forms that record the number of doses taken. This will allow the doctor and patient to work together to make sure the medicines are being taken properly. Patients and parents will also be interviewed periodically about their understanding of HIV disease about social supports that are available and about the child's emotional adjustment.    ,NCT00032669
HIV,A Comparison of Adefovir and Tenofovir for the Treatment of Lamivudine-Resistant Hepatitis B Virus in People With HIV, Control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can be difficult in HIV infected people who have taken the antiviral lamivudine (3TC). These people may have HBV that has become resistant to 3TC. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has shown promising anti-HBV activity in clinical trials; tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is used to treat HIV and may also be effective against HBV. The purpose of this study is to find out if adding ADV or TDF to a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen that includes 3TC has an effect on HBV infection in patients coinfected with HIV and HBV. The tolerability and safety of these drugs will be examined.    ,NCT00033163
HIV,Study of Anti-HIV Therapy Intensification, The purpose of this study is to see how the body's immune system changes after replacing and adding new anti-HIV drugs to a patient's current anti-HIV therapy. This study will also see whether adding drugs is safe. Patients who take part in A5136 are also eligible to take part in 2 substudies. The purpose of substudy A5140s is to see how many latently infected cells (cells in which the HIV virus survives) are in the lymph node (small rounded structures that make disease-fighting cells). Substudy A5155s will be performed to see how many latently infected cells are in the blood before and after replacing and adding anti-HIV drugs. ACTG A5136 is a follow-up study to ACTG 315 and ACTG 375 which were designed to examine the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in certain HIV-infected patients. Many HIV-infected patients have undergone long-term anti-HIV therapy and have had the virus suppressed. However most of these patients still have problems with their immune systems. The reason for these problems is unknown. This study may help researchers understand what causes immune system problems in people who have low levels of HIV in their blood.    ,NCT00034086
HIV,Dose Ranging Trial of Tipranavir/Ritonavir in Treatment-Experienced HIV Infected Individuals, The purpose of this research study is to determine which of three different dose combinations of tipranavir and ritonavir when taken with a standard approved anti-HIV drug therapy is most effective and safe. Tipranavir is an investigational protease inhibitor which has been demonstrated to have in vitro activity against HIV-1.    ,NCT00034866
HIV,Phase III PEG-Intron in HIV-infected Patients (Study P00738), This is a randomized double-blind multicenter trial testing 2 doses of PEG-Intron 1.0mcg/kg/week and 3.0mcg/kg/week in heavily treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients compared to placebo. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEG-Intron when added to stable optimized background antiretroviral therapy in this patient population.    ,NCT00035360
HIV,Atazanavir (BMS-232632) in Combination With Ritonavir or Saquinavir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir Each With Tenofovir and a Nucleoside in Subjects With HIV, The purpose of this study is to learn how well atazanavir (ATV) works in combination with ritonavir (RTV) or saquinavir (SQV) with tenofovir (TDF) and a nucleoside to reduce the viral load of treatment experienced subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There is a comparison arm with lopinavir (LPV)/RTV and TDF and a nucleoside.    ,NCT00035932
HIV,A Study to Compare Anti-HIV Drugs Given Twice a Day or Once a Day With or Without Direct Observation, Anti-HIV drug therapy works best when the drugs are taken exactly as prescribed by a doctor. Because anti-HIV therapy often involves multiple drugs some people have difficulty taking them all correctly. The easier it is to take anti-HIV drugs the more likely people will take them as prescribed and get the best results. This study will see if people are more successful in taking anti-HIV drugs once a day or twice a day. It also will determine if having a health care professional oversee each weekday dose helps people control their HIV infection. The study will compare taking a three-drug combination twice a day versus taking a three-drug combination just once a day. The study will also compare patients taking the drugs on their own to patients taking the drugs in the presence of a clinical worker. Viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) and drug side effects will be measured.    ,NCT00036452
HIV,Effects of Changing HIV Therapy at Lower Versus Higher Viral Loads, This study will look at people who have been taking anti-HIV drugs but still have detectable levels of HIV. The purpose of the study is to find out what happens in those people who change anti-HIV drugs when their viral load reaches 200 copies compared to those who change anti-HIV drugs when their viral load reaches 10000 copies. This study will also look at drug resistance (how well HIV responds to drugs) viral fitness (how well drug-resistant HIV copies itself) and immunologic reconstitution (how well the immune system recognizes various infections including HIV). Many patients experience virologic relapse (increase in viral load after sustained viral load suppression) within 1 to 2 years of taking anti-HIV drugs. The approach to treatment for patients who experience virologic relapse while on a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has not been defined. Current guidelines recommend switching to a new treatment regimen as soon as possible to prevent HIV from becoming even more resistant to anti-HIV drugs. However there is evidence that patients can benefit from staying on the same HAART drugs even after virologic relapse. This study wants to find what happens when drugs are changed immediately after virologic relapse (when the viral load is lower) compared to what happens if drugs are changed only after a delay (when the viral load is higher).    ,NCT00036465
HIV,Use of Muscle Spectroscopy to Evaluate Mitochondrial Dysfunction in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to see if magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to detect damage to the mitochondria in HIV-infected patients taking nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drugs. HIV-infected patients taking NRTI drugs may have an increase in a chemical in their blood called lactate. High lactate levels may damage the energy source of the cell (mitochondria). Damage to mitochondria may cause lactic acidosis liver failure and other problems. It is important to find effective ways to see if the mitochondria of HIV-infected patients have been damaged. This study will see if MRS can be used to determine mitochondrial damage.    ,NCT00036478
HIV,A Dose Escalation Study of Tenofovir Alafenamide in Treatment-Naive Patients, This study evaluated two doses of tenofovir alafenamide versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF).    ,NCT00036634
HIV,A Study to See if Certain Antioxidants and Vitamins Will Keep Lactate Levels Down in Patients Taking Anti-HIV Drugs, The purpose of this study is to see if certain vitamins (C E B1 and B2) can keep lactate levels from becoming too high in patients who are taking nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) anti-HIV drugs. Some patients taking anti-HIV drugs develop hyperlactatemia. Hyperlactatemia is a condition in which lactate (a natural substance normally present in the body) levels are too high. Too much lactate in the body can lead to serious health problems. When patients suffer from hyperlactatemia while taking anti-HIV drugs most doctors temporarily stop the drugs. Patients then restart the anti-HIV drugs when their lactate levels return to normal. If patients restart the same drugs they were taking when they developed hyperlactatemia there is a risk that they may develop high lactate levels again. This study wants to find out if taking antioxidants (substances that reduce tissue damage due to oxygen radicals) and certain B vitamins may help prevent patients from developing hyperlactatemia when they restart the same anti-HIV drugs.    ,NCT00037063
HIV,Prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus Infection in HIV-Infected Children, The purpose of this study is to find out how many children who are infected with HIV are also infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV infection is a major health concern. HIV-infected adults who are co-infected with HCV appear to have more rapid HIV disease progression. There is little data on how widespread HCV is among children who are HIV-infected. Information from this study will help determine the need for future HCV studies. This study also will obtain blood samples for future testing for other hepatitis viruses such as hepatitis G virus (HGV or GB virus C).    ,NCT00037076
HIV,Effectiveness of ABT-378/Ritonavir Plus Lamivudine Plus Efavirenz Plus Tenofovir DF in HIV-Infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to see if a novel 4-drug anti-HIV combination can suppress the growth of HIV in patients infected with the virus.    ,NCT00038220
HIV,Interleukin-2 (IL-2) Treatment for HIV Infected Patients Who Have Interrupted Their Anti-HIV Drug Therapy, When an HIV infected person taking strong anti-HIV drugs temporarily stops taking them viral load rises and the body's immune system is exposed to more HIV. This may lead to the body mounting a better immune response against the virus. The purpose of this study is to find out if taking interleukin-2 (also called IL-2 or aldesleukin) while stopping anti-HIV drugs for short periods of time can help patients control their HIV viral load. Study hypothesis: Patients in this study will have lower virologic rebound and will maintain their CD4 cell counts for a longer time than other patients in comparative studies.    ,NCT00038259
HIV,A Study of DAPD Alone Versus DAPD Plus MMF for Treatment of HIV Infection, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety efficacy and side effects of beta-D-26-diaminopurine dioxolane (DAPD) compared to DAPD plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) when these drugs are added to the anti-HIV treatment regimens of people infected with HIV. Some studies have shown that DAPD and MMF can help fight HIV. However neither DAPD nor MMF has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating HIV infection. This study will help doctors decide if DAPD and MMF are good drugs for treating HIV.    ,NCT00038272
HIV,Safety and Effectiveness of Lopinavir/Ritonavir in HIV Infected Infants, The purpose of this study is to find out if the drug lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) is safe and well tolerated in HIV infected infants. This study will also determine the most effective dose of LPV/RTV for infants.    ,NCT00038480
HIV,Amprenavir/Ritonavir or Saquinavir/Ritonavir in HIV-Infected Subjects Following Failure With Kaletra as Their Second Protease Inhibitor, The purpose of this study is to study the safety and efficacy of Amprenavir/ritonavir or saquinavir/ritonavir in HIV infected patients that have failed Kaletra as their second protease inhibitor based HAART.    ,NCT00038519
HIV,Amprenavir/Ritonavir Saquinavir/Ritonavir or Efavirenz in HIV-Infected Subjects Following Failure With Kaletra (ABT-378/Ritonavir) as Their First Protease Inhibitor Based HAART, The purpose of this study is to study amprenavir/ritonavir saquinavir/ritonavir or efavirenz in HIV-infected patients following failure with Kaletra (ABT-378/ritonavir) as their first protease inhibitor based HAART.    ,NCT00038532
HIV,A Study of Two Different Doses of ABT-378/Ritonavir in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Taken Protease Inhibitors and Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of a high dose of ABT-378/ritonavir    ,NCT00038636
HIV,A Study of Peer Education to Prevent HIV Transmission Among Injection Drug Users and Their HIV Risk Contacts, Injection drug use is the major mode of HIV transmission in many countries. Injection drug users (IDUs) transmit HIV not only through shared drug injection equipment but also through heterosexual and homosexual transmission and mother-to-child transmission. Studies have shown that peer education programs can reduce HIV risk behavior in IDUs. However it is not known if reduced HIV risk behavior leads to fewer HIV infections. The purpose of this study is to find out if a peer education program can reduce the number of new HIV infections by changing the behavior of IDUs and their HIV risk contacts.    ,NCT00038688
HIV,Endothelial Dysfunction as a Risk Factor in HIV Study, Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven effective in altering the natural history of HIV infection in many patients. However this therapy may not be sustainable because of the toxicities of the medications. Evidence suggests that HIV-infected patients on HAART may be at risk for premature coronary artery disease. The exact cause is unknown. It is possible that the medications directly affect the endothelium (the lining of the arteries that supply blood to the heart) and lead to premature heart disease. Or because the medications cause lipid abnormalities (high cholesterol) and a condition of relative insulin resistance in which the body has a difficult time processing sugars; known risk factors for endothelial dysfunction and heart disease. Therapeutic intervention that reverses these lipid abnormalities and/or insulin resistance may lower these risk factors normalize endothelial function and decrease the risk of heart disease. This protocol aims to assess endothelial function among a group of HIV-infected patients with varying degrees of viral activity and levels of immune function on a variety of HAART regimens. It also aims to evaluate the effect of three different medications on lipids insulin resistance and thus endothelial function. Understanding the factors involved in causing endothelial dysfunction will help better characterize the relative risks and benefits of early versus late and continuous versus intermittent HAART therapy. The research may offer some insights into the causes of premature heart disease among HIV-infected patients on HAART that could be more thoroughly investigated in subsequent clinical trials. A total of 75 patients will be recruited: 25 for each arm of the study. Each arm evaluates the potential benefit of a particular medication and will enroll sequentially. An endothelial function test will be performed on an outpatient basis. The first 25 patients will be assigned at random to receive pravastatin sodium or placebo; the next 25 will receive gemfibrozil or placebo; the final 25 will receive rosiglitazone or placebo. Patients will take the pills for 6 weeks no pills for the next 4 weeks and then the opposite treatment for 6 more weeks. Two weeks after the start of the study drug blood will be taken to check for potential toxic side effects. After each 6-week treatment blood will be drawn and endothelial function tests will be performed.    ,NCT00039663
HIV,Anti-HIV Drug Regimens and Treatment-Switching Guidelines in HIV Infected Children, Little is known about what treatment combinations are best for HIV infected children. This study examined the long-term effectiveness of different anti-HIV drug combinations in children and strategies for switching treatment if the first treatment does not work. The study enrolled children who had not previously taken anti-HIV medication. Participants in this study were recruited in the United States South America and Europe. Some European children may also enroll in a substudy that will observe changes in body fat in children taking anti-HIV medications.    ,NCT00039741
HIV,Interactions Between HIV Protease Inhibitors and Calcium Channel Blockers, Diltiazem CD and amlodipine are drugs used to treat heart disease and high blood pressure. The purpose of this study is to find out if these drugs interact with the anti-HIV drugs indinavir and ritonavir. The study will also look at the safety of taking the study drugs together. Heart disease and high blood pressure are major health concerns for people with HIV. Standard treatment for these illnesses often includes calcium channel blockers (CCBs). There is a potential for significant drug interactions between CCBs and HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) that may influence the dosing monitoring and choosing of CCBs and PIs when used in people infected with HIV. This study will examine the drug interactions between 2 commonly used CCBs and the PI combination indinavir and ritonavir (IDV/RTV). This information should help doctors choose the appropriate treatment for high blood pressure or heart disease in people taking PIs.    ,NCT00039975

HIV,Using Drug Levels in the Blood to Guide Therapy in HIV Infected Patients Taking a Protease Inhibitor, Drug resistance testing can be used to see which anti-HIV drugs are likely to suppress the growth of HIV and to select an anti-HIV regimen for HIV infected patients who have failed previous drug regimens. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a process that involves measuring blood levels of a drug and may further increase the benefits that resistance testing offers by optimizing protease inhibitor (PI) drug concentrations. The purpose of this study is to determine whether changing the dose of PIs as indicated by TDM reduces the viral load in PI-experienced patients. Hypothesis: Treatment-naive study participants who undergo TDM and whose clinicians' interpret their TDM results and adjust their PI doses will have better virologic response rates and decreased toxicities (and thus better treatment outcomes) than participants who do not undergo TDM.    ,NCT00041769
HIV,A Study of HIV Levels During Pregnancy and After Childbirth, The purpose of this study is to find out if HIV-infected pregnant women taking anti-HIV drugs have an increased amount of HIV in their blood (viral load) after having the baby. The purpose of A5153s a substudy of A5150 is to characterize two anti-HIV drugs (nelfinavir [NFV] and lopinavir/ritonavir [LPV/r]) in HIV-infected women during pregnancy and after childbirth.

HIV,Safety of an HIV DNA Vaccine Given to HIV Uninfected Adults, The purpose of this study is to see if the experimental HIV vaccine pGA2/JS2 is safe and is well tolerated at two different doses. Another important purpose of this study is to observe how the immune system responds to the vaccine at different dose levels. Vaccines are given to people to help their bodies fight infection. The vaccine being tested in this study is a DNA vaccine. The pGA2/JS2 plasmid DNA vaccine instructs the body to make some HIV proteins. These HIV proteins may trigger an immune response. Because only a few of the many proteins HIV needs are made through DNA vaccination there is no risk of getting HIV from the vaccination. This and other similar DNA vaccines have been tested for safety in mice rabbits and monkeys. The vaccine has been well tolerated at doses to be used in this study.    ,NCT00043511
HIV,HIV Expression in Patients With Low Viral Load on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), This study will investigate low-level viral loads in HIV-infected patients taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Although HAART reduces viral levels and restores immune function to some degree it does not cure HIV infection. The virus persists even at levels below that which it can be detected. This study will examine where this residual virus comes from in order to better understand the infection and the effectiveness of therapies. In addition the study will 1) evaluate the ability of a new test to detect the virus at low levels; and 2) determine whether adding the protease inhibitor Kaletra to the HAART treatment regimen for patients with a low viral load will further decrease their viral load. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Patients involved in the viral load test will be recruited from an NIAID HIV study in which they are already participating. Three groups of patients will be enrolled: those with a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml plasma those with 51-500 copies/ml and those with 501-5000 copies/ml. Patients involved in the Kaletra trial must have been taking HAART for 6 months or more and have less than 50 viral copies/ml plasma. They will be screened for this study with a history physical examination and routine laboratory tests. Participants in the viral load test evaluation will donate 70 ml of blood up to four times. No more than one sample will be collected per day. Participants in the Kaletra trial will have blood samples drawn on two successive days and will then be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group will begin Kaletra therapy (four capsules two times a day) immediately; the other will undergo observation for 4 weeks before starting Kaletra. Depending on what group they are in patients will provide blood samples for viral load measurements and clinical samples according to the following schedule: Immediate Kaletra One sample each during weeks 1 2 and 3 of therapy and two samples during week 4. Delayed Kaletra One sample each during weeks 1 2 and 3 of observation and two samples during week 4. After starting therapy one sample will be collected each week during weeks 1 2 and 3 of therapy and two samples during week 4. In both groups after the last dose of medicine on day 28 Kaletra therapy will be complete. At the end of therapy additional blood will be collected for viral sampling as follows: one sample each during weeks 1 2 and 3 and two samples during week 4 after Kaletra therapy.    ,NCT00043641

They will be vaccinated annually for 3 years. A blood sample (10 ml) will be drawn 1 month after each vaccination to measure the immune response. Some of the blood drawn for this study will be stored and used for research purposes. TEPVAC Participants will have 10 ml of blood drawn to assess their baseline antibody levels. They will receive two vaccinations (tetanus and pneumococcus) 12 months after enrolling in ESPRIT and another two vaccinations 24 months after enrollment. A blood sample (10 ml) will be drawn 1 month after each vaccination to measure the immune response. Some of the blood drawn for this study will be stored and used for research purposes.    ,NCT00050726
HIV,Fuzeon (Enfuvirtide) Early Access Program for Patients With HIV-1 Infection, This study will determine the safety and tolerability of Fuzeon (enfuvirtide) used together with other treatments for HIV infection in patients with advanced HIV disease. Fuzeon is an antiretroviral drug. Unlike other antiretrovirals however which work against the virus once it is already in the cell Fuzeon prevents the virus from getting into healthy cells. Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced HIV-1 infection who do not respond to approved antiretroviral therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have a CD4 lymphocyte count less than 100 cells/mm3 and a viral load greater than 10000 copies/mL. They will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood tests and may also have an electrocardiogram (ECG) chest x-ray and urine test. Patients enrolled in the study will be re-examined and have additional blood tests before beginning treatment with Fuzeon. They will then be taught how to self-inject the medicine under the skin and will take two doses daily (less than 1/4 teaspoon each) 12 hours apart. After the first treatment participants will have follow-up visits at weeks 1 2 4 8 12 24 36 48 and every 12 weeks after that if necessary until 12 weeks after the drug becomes commercially available. Visits may be scheduled more often if a problem arises. During the follow-up visits patients will have blood drawn and their blood pressure pulse rate and temperature will be checked. They will also report any drug side effects they have experienced. Patients may continue to take Fuzeon as long as they benefit from therapy and do not experience severe side effects from the treatment. The drug will be provided to participants until 12 weeks after it is sold in the United States.    ,NCT00050856

HIV,Immune Response to Influenza Vaccine in HIV-Infected Individuals, This study will evaluate how HIV infection including CD4 cell count and viral load affects the patient's ability to produce antibodies in response to vaccination with the influenza (flu) vaccine. Earlier studies have shown that people with HIV infection do not respond as well as healthy subjects to flu vaccine; that is they don't make as many antibodies in response to the vaccine. Before the use of current anti-HIV medications antibodies made to flu vaccination in HIV-positive individuals was related to their CD4 cell count. This trial will examine how CD4 counts and the amount of virus in the blood affect how much and what kind of antibodies the body makes to the flu vaccine. HIV-infected patients and healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Healthy subjects will serve as controls to make sure the flu vaccine works (i.e. stimulates production of enough antibody to protect against the flu) and to compare the amount of antibodies made by HIV-positive and HIV-negative people. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and blood tests (see below). Women who are able to have children will have a pregnancy test. Pregnant women are excluded from the study. Participants will undergo the following procedures:   1. Blood drawing for the following tests:   -  Routine tests (complete blood count kidney and liver functions electrolyte levels).   -  CD4 cell count.   -  HLA typing (a genetic marker of the immune system) if it has not already been done at the NIH.

HIV,Phase II/III Study Evaluating the Effect of IL-2 on Preservation of the CD4 T-Lymphocytes After Interruption of Antiretroviral Treatment in HIV-Infected Patients With CD4 T-Lymphocyte Count Greater Than 500 Cells/mm3 Who Received Antiretroviral Tx, This study will examine whether interleukin-2 (IL-2) given before the interruption of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment could significantly extend the period of time that a patient is temporarily not taking ARV treatment and also preserve CD4 counts above 350 cells per microliter. There will be an evaluation of the toxicity or extremely harmful effects of ARV and the effect on quality of life. The use of ARV medications has greatly improved the condition and mortality of HIV-infected patients. But when used long term those medications have been associated with great toxicities and medication fatigue. As a result patients may not adhere to ARV use and resistance to viruses may grow. The CD4 molecule is on the surface of helper T-lymphocytes or T-helper cells. It serves as the primary receptor for HIV-1 and HIV-2 allowing the virus to gain entry into its host. The CD4 count increases immediately in response to ARV giving an estimate of the state of a patient's immune system. Thus it is a strong marker of the immediate risk of an opportunistic infection one that takes advantage of a person's weakened immune system. IL-2 is a molecule naturally produced by activated T cells. In patients with HIV IL-2 treatment can increase CD4 counts but the clinical importance of this increase is not clear. This study will compare the decline in CD4 count when ARV is interrupted in two random groups of participants: (1) those who will receive three cycles of IL-2 (one every 8 weeks) in combination with ARV therapy for the first 24 weeks of the study before stopping ARV and (2) those who will receive ARV therapy without IL-2 for 24 weeks before stopping ARV. Patients 18 years of age or older who have HIV-1 infection and who have been on ARV therapy for at least 1 year and who currently have a CD4 count 500 cells per microliter or higher and never had a CD4 count of less than 200 cells per microliter and a viral load less than the limit of detection may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo the following procedures and tests:   -  Physical examination.   -  Blood tests to measure blood lipids (fats) sugar complete blood count including platelets and chemistries.   -  Assessment of fat distribution.   -  Questionnaire about quality of life. In addition those participants who are randomly placed in the group receiving IL-2 and ARV will get an echocardiogram at the beginning of the study and at week 24. They will receive a starting dose of 6 million units of IL-2 as an injection under the skin twice a day. Each of the three IL-2 cycles will last 5 days. After the 24-week period participants in both groups will stop taking ARV medications if their CD4 count is still equal to or greater than 500 cells per microliter. The study will continue into 120 weeks. Participants will be asked to continue to visit the clinic every 8 weeks for evaluation of their viral load and CD4 counts. Every 24 weeks they will be asked to answer a questionnaire about their quality of life. Blood tests and other measurements will also be done as follow-up.    ,NCT00071890

HIV,Effectiveness of and Immune Response to HIV Vaccination Followed by Treatment Interruption in HIV Infected Patients, HIV vaccines may help the immune systems of HIV infected patients better control the virus. The goal of this study is to determine whether patients on anti-HIV medications can stop taking those medications if they receive an HIV vaccine. While taking anti-HIV medications participants will receive either an HIV vaccine or a placebo. Participants will then stop taking their anti-HIV medications and the study will compare the viral loads of participants who received the vaccine with the viral loads of participants who received the placebo. Primary study hypotheses: 1)The Week 12 and Week 16 post-ART interruption geometric mean HIV-1 RNA levels will be lower among participants who had received MRK Ad5 vaccine prior to ART interruption than among participants who received placebo; 2) the time averaged area under the curve of the log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml versus day function in the 16 week post-ART interruption step will be lower among participants who received the MRK Ad5 vaccine prior to ART interruption than among participants who receive placebo.    ,NCT00080106
HIV,Daclizumab to Treat HIV-Infected Patients, This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of daclizumab (also called Zenapax or anti-CD25) in reducing viral replication in patients with HIV infection. Although HAART an intensive anti-HIV treatment regimen can suppress HIV in blood below the limit of detection it cannot completely eradicate the virus. This study will focus on the effectiveness of daclizumab in further reducing viral replication in patients with low viral counts. The Food and Drug Administration approved daclizumab in 1997 for preventing kidney transplant rejection and it has also been studied in people with an eye infection called uveitis. The drug works by binding to a protein on T cells (white blood cells of the immune system) called CD25. This prevents another protein called interleukin-2 (IL-2) from binding to this site thus preventing a series of events that normally results in inflammation. Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with HIV infection who have stable HIV levels at less than 30000 copies/mL of blood and CD4 T cell counts higher than 400 cells/cmm may be eligible for this study. Patients who have taken drugs that affect the immune system such as IL-2 and interferon in the past 5 years may not participate. Candidates are screened with a comprehensive medical examination including physical examination and laboratory studies. X-rays consultations and biopsies are done only if medically indicated. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  Daclizumab therapy: Patients receive daclizumab as a 25-minute infusion through an intravenous catheter (plastic tube placed in a vein) at the NIH Clinical Center outpatient clinic. A total of three doses of drug are given. The first dose is given on study day 1 the second dose is given 2 weeks later and the third dose is given 4 weeks later. Patients are observed for at least 1 hour after each infusion before being discharged from the clinic.   -  Follow-up visits: Patients return to the outpatient clinic every 2 weeks while they are on medication and then every month until 3 months after the final dose to evaluate their infection status response to therapy and medication side effects. The visits include a physical examination blood draws and possibly x-rays if medically indicated.   -  Apheresis: Patients undergo apheresis a procedure for collecting large amounts of white blood cells three times during the study - once before starting daclizumab therapy 4 weeks after beginning therapy and 12 weeks after beginning therapy. For apheresis blood is removed through a needle in the vein of one arm and spun in a machine that separates it into its components. The white blood cells and plasma are removed and the red cells and platelets are re-infused either through the same needle or through a needle in a vein in the other arm.    ,NCT00080431

The purpose of this study is to determine whether two drugs atazanavir (ATV) and ritonavir (RTV) will control HIV infection when taken together without any other anti-HIV drugs after 48 weeks of viral suppression. Hypothesis: Simplified maintenance therapy with ATV and RTV alone after virologic suppression does not markedly increase the risk of virologic failure.    ,NCT00084019
HIV,Anti-HIV Medications and Structured Treatment Interruptions for People Recently Infected With HIV, People recently infected with HIV who are treated with anti-HIV medications may develop strong immune system responses to HIV and may be able to control the virus without continuing to take these medications. The purpose of this study is to see if giving anti-HIV medications to people soon after they have been infected with HIV can help them control HIV. The study will also see if the immune system can control the amount of HIV virus in the blood (viral load) even after a person has stopped taking the medications. The study will evaluate three different schedules of stopping and starting anti-HIV medications to see which schedule is best able to boost a patient's immune system to control HIV viral load. Hypothesis: Combination therapy started in primary HIV infection in conjunction with structured treatment interruptions will result in greater control of viremia off treatment than induction therapy alone.    ,NCT00084032

HIV,Effect of Tenofovir DF on Bone Metabolism in Children, This study will examine the long-term effects particularly on bone metabolism of the drug tenofovir DF in children with HIV infection. Tenofovir DF is approved for treating HIV-infected adults but its use in children has not yet been approved. The drug may be helpful for children who have been treated with many other drugs and still have detectable HIV in their blood despite ongoing therapy. In a previous study many children given tenofovir DF responded well with increases in T-cell counts and decreases in viral load. However many children also experienced bone thinning. This study will explore the problem of bone thinning in children taking tenofovir DF in combination with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HIV-infected patients from 4 to 20 years old who are taking tenofovir DF or for whom tenofovir DF treatment has been recommended may be eligible for this 3-year study. Participants take tenofovir DF every day in addition to their antiretroviral therapy. They have frequent follow-up visits for tests and procedures as follows:   -  Study days 0 2 and 4: blood tests.   -  Screening and every study visit starting day 6: Physical exam medical history blood and urine tests.   -  Baseline and every 48 weeks: Dental and eye examinations kidney ultrasound tuberculin skin testing chest x-ray electrocardiogram and echocardiogram computed tomography (CT) scan neuropsychological testing and neurologic assessment.   -  The bone age hand x-rays are done every 24 weeks unless the growth plates are fused (i.e. the child has stopped growing)   -  DEXAs are done at 0 12 24 weeks and every 24 weeks thereafter. Dual energy x-ray absorptionometry (DEXA) scan is used to assess bone density. The patient lies still on a table while the spine and hip are scanned using a small amount of radiation. Only the spine and hip are scanned in the DEXA scan test.   -  Baseline and week 24: Optional bone biopsy. Some patients are asked to undergo a bone biopsy to better understand the effect of Tenofovir DF on bone. For the procedure the child is given a sedative. The skin over the hipbone is numbed with a small needle a small incision is made and a larger needle is inserted into the bone. Some of the bone tissue is withdrawn through the needle and the incision is closed.   -  Possible lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This optional procedure analyzes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. The patient is given a local anesthetic and a needle is inserted into the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the needle. There is no specific schedule for this procedure if the patient opts for it. Patients who are benefiting from tenofovir DF therapy but show signs of bone effects are offered treatment with pamidronate (Aredia) a drug used to treat hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood). Patients who stop taking tenofovir DF because of bone toxicity continue to be followed on the regular study schedule. Those who stop the drug for toxicity other than bone toxicity or for toxicity not related to tenofovir DF are followed every 4 weeks until their laboratory test results improve.    ,NCT00088309

HIV,NNRTI vs PI Regimens for HIV Infected Women After They Have Taken Nevirapine to Prevent Mother-To-Child HIV Transmission, Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are commonly included in anti-HIV drug regimens. However HIV infected women who have previously taken the single dose NNRTI nevirapine (SD NVP) for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV may not respond as well to NNRTIs as women who have never taken NVP. Another class of anti-HIV drugs protease inhibitors (PIs) may be more effective for women who have previously taken NNRTIs. This study will compare the effectiveness of NNRTI- and PI-based regimens in women who have taken NVP for prevention of MTCT of HIV. This study will also compare regimens including an NNRTI with regimens including a PI in women who have never taken NVP.    ,NCT00089505

HIV,Candidate HIV Vaccine," This study will evaluate whether an experimental vaccine intended to prevent HIV infection is safe and whether it causes any side effects. It will also examine whether the vaccine called VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP causes an immune response and will monitor participants for the social impact of being in an HIV vaccine study. VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP contains synthetic DNA that codes for parts of four HIV proteins. It also contains a ""promoter"" piece of DNA that is needed to start protein production. The promoter DNA is also synthetic and is like the promoter in another virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV). The vaccine contains no live HIV virus or CMV and cannot cause either of these illnesses. Healthy volunteers between 18 and 44 years old who are HIV-negative may be eligible for this 32-week study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests. Participants receive three injections of the experimental vaccine approximately 28 days apart. The injections are given with a system called the Biojector 2000 that delivers the vaccine through the skin into the muscle without the use of a needle. Subjects are observed for side effects for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination and are required to telephone the clinic staff 1 to 2 days after the injection to report how they are doing. In addition they are given a diary card to take home on which they record their temperature and any symptoms daily for five days. Participants return to the clinic two weeks after each injection. They return the completed diary card and are checked for any health changes or problems since the last visit. They are asked how they are feeling and what medications if any they have taken. Blood and urine samples are collected. Some subjects may be asked to have laboratory tests between regular visits if needed to evaluate a change in health. Participants are also asked about any social effects they may have experienced as a result of their participation in the study.    ",NCT00089531

HIV,Trial of Maraviroc (UK-427857) in Combination With Optimized Background Therapy Versus Optimized Background Therapy Alone for the Treatment of Antiretroviral-Experienced NonCCR5-Tropic HIV-1 Infected Subjects, Maraviroc (UK-427857) a selective and reversible CCR5 co-receptor antagonist has been shown to be active in vitro against a wide range of clinical isolates (including those resistant to existing classes). In HIV-1 infected patients in the United States maraviroc (UK-427857) is approved for use as part of combination antiretroviral treatment in treatment-experienced and treatment-naive adult subjects. At least 50% of treatment-experienced patients are infected with R5-tropic HIV-1 exclusively. However even in patients infected with a dual tropic (R5 + X4) phenotype a large proportion of the virus population still uses CCR5 exclusively. Thus the purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiretroviral activity and safety of maraviroc (UK-427857) (in combination with other agents) in HIV infected treatment experienced patients who are failing their current antiretroviral regimen and not infected with R5-tropic virus exclusively. This study will involve more than 200 centers globally to achieve a total randomized subject population of 192 subjects. Patients will be randomly (1:1:1) assigned to one of three groups: Optimized Background Therapy [OBT (3-6 drugs based on treatment history and resistance testing)] + maraviroc (UK-427857) 150 mg taken once daily OBT + maraviroc (UK-427857) 150 mg taken twice daily or OBT alone.

HIV,Comparison of Three Anti-HIV Regimens to Prevent Nevirapine Resistance in Women Who Take Nevirapine During Pregnancy, HIV infected pregnant women may take single-dose nevirapine (SD NVP) prior to giving birth to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. However SD NVP may cause NVP resistance in the mother potentially ruling out some treatment options in the future. The purpose of this study is to determine which of three anti-HIV drug regimens most effectively reduces the development of maternal NVP resistance in HIV infected pregnant women. The effectiveness of short-term (7 day therapy) versus long-term (21-day therapy) regimens will also be compared. The study hypotheses are: 1) intrapartum SD NVP with a 21-day course of antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in less frequent selection of NVP-resistant HIV-1 variants than intrapartum SD NVP with a 7-day course of ART and 2) a 7- or 21-day course of lamivudine/zidovudine (3TC/ZDV) emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) following SD NVP will not select nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)- or protease inhibitor (PI)- resistant HIV-1 variants.    ,NCT00099632

HIV,Effect of Leflunomide on T Cell Proliferation in HIV-Infected Patients, This study will evaluate the effect of leflunomide on the life cycle of a specific immune cell called CD4+ T cell in HIV-infected patients. Leflunomide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating rheumatoid arthritis. It works by blocking cell division in activated T cells. In HIV infection the HIV virus causes increased activation of T cells. The activated cells become infected and die. Activation may also cause the death of T cells that are not infected with HIV. T cells are necessary for the body to fight infections and cancer. This study will see if leflunomide can block T-cell division and possibly reduce the number of cells that die reduce the number of cells in which HIV can reproduce and lead to a lower level of HIV virus in the body. HIV-infected patients between 18 and 65 years of age who have 1) HIV viral levels of 1000 copies/mL or more 2) a CD4+ T-cell count of 350 cells/mm3 or more and 3) a CD4+ T-cell count that has never been less than 200 cells/mm3 may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination blood and urine tests chest x-ray and electrocardiogram (EKG). Participants are randomly assigned to take leflunomide or placebo (a substance with no active ingredient) every day for 28 days. They come to the clinic three times during the first 29 days of the study (days 1 15 and 29) for a physical examination and review of any drug side effects. Patients taking placebo end their participation on day 29. Patients taking leflunomide stop taking the drug on day 29 and begin taking cholestyramine three times a day for 11 days out of the next 14 days to clear the leflunomide from their body. On day 43 they return to the clinic to have their leflunomide level checked to make sure that only very little or none of the drug remains in the body. If the level is low patients end their participation on or around day 57. If the level remains high they repeat the cholestyramine treatment.    ,NCT00101374

HIV,Relationship Between Fatigue and Mitochondrial Damage in Patients With HIV/AIDS, This study will examine abnormalities in mitochondria (energy-producing machinery of cells) and in genes related to mitochondria in the blood cells muscle and fat of HIV-positive patients who are taking nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and in patients not currently taking HIV medications and compare the results to healthy volunteers. Many patients with HIV infection take NRTIs to help control the infection. These medications may damage cell mitochondria possibly causing side effects such as fatigue. This study will explore the relationship between changes in mitochondria and related genes and patient reports of energy level mood and quality of life. Healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients between 18 and 55 years of age may be eligible for this study. Healthy volunteers must test negative for the HIV antibody. HIV-positive patients must have been diagnosed positive for at least 1 year. Patients who are taking antiretroviral therapy must have been taking the same drug regimen (with at least two NTRIs and no protease inhibitors) for at least 3 months. HIV positive patients not taking antiretroviral medication must not have had antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year. Candidates are screened with a medical history brief physical examination blood and urine tests and questionnaires related to mood and energy. Qualified volunteers will undergo the following procedures during three or four study visits: Visit 1 Complete history and physical examination blood tests and questionnaires about energy level mood and quality of life. Visit 2 Muscle and fat biopsy: Before the biopsy blood is drawn to check blood counts and to test for pregnancy in women who can become pregnant. The biopsy is done on an outpatient basis in the operating room. The site of the biopsy (an area on the upper arm or upper leg) is numbed with an injection under the skin. A 1-inch incision is made over the muscle to be biopsied and a small sample of muscle tissue and small sample of fat are removed. The incision is then closed and bandaged. Following the biopsy you will be monitored for about 4 hours in the clinic. Strenuous physical activity should be restricted in the week following biopsy to allow healing. Visit 3 Examination of biopsy site and possible apheresis: The biopsy site is examined for healing. Apheresis may be scheduled for this visit or for an extra visit between the biopsy and the final visit. This procedure for obtaining white blood cells for study is optional. For apheresis blood is withdrawn from a needle placed in a vein in the arm and the white cells are separated from the rest of the blood. The white cells are extracted and the red cells and plasma are then returned to the body through a second needle.    ,NCT00106795

HIV,"""Prime-Boost"" Vaccine Schedule for Prevention of HIV Infection"," This study will determine the safety and side effects of two experimental HIV vaccines given in a ""prime-boost"" schedule. It will also monitor participants for the social impact of being in an HIV vaccine study (e.g. problems with insurance health care friends family employment housing and so forth). The vaccines are VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP (called the DNA vaccine) and VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (called the rAd vaccine). The DNA vaccine codes for four HIV proteins. The rAd vaccine is made using an adenovirus (a common virus that causes upper respiratory infections such as the common cold) that has been modified to contain DNA that codes for three HIV proteins. These vaccines cannot cause HIV or adenoviral infections. The study will also see if the vaccines cause an immune response; if the injection of the DNA vaccine given using a needle and syringe is similar in safety and immune response to giving them with a needleless injection device called a Biojector 2000; if people who already have antibodies to adenovirus still have an immune response to rAd vaccine; and if there are social harms that result from participating in an HIV vaccine study. Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this 42-week study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination blood and urine tests (including pregnancy test for women) and questions regarding sexual behavior and other practices. Participants receive three injections (shots) of the DNA vaccine and one injection of the rAd vaccine. All injections are given into a muscle in the upper arm (alternating right and left arms with each injection) using a needle and syringe or the needleless Biojector 2000. The first vaccination is given the day of enrollment into the study and the DNA vaccinations are given about 4 weeks apart from each other with a minimum of 21 days between injections. The rAd ""booster""vaccination is given at Week 24. Participants fill out a diary card at home for 5 days after each vaccination recording their temperature and any symptoms. They come to the clinic for follow-up 3 days each DNA vaccine injection and call or return again 7 days after each injection. They call a study nurse 1 or 2 days after the rAd injection. There are 15 to 18 clinic visits during the course of the study. At each visit participants are checked for health changes or problems. Blood and urine samples are collected at some visits. Participants are periodically tested for HIV and asked questions about their sexual behavior and drug use and are counseled throughout the study on HIV risk reduction. They are also asked about any social effects they may have experienced as a result of their participation in this study.    ",NCT00109629
HIV,Central Nervous System Disease in HIV-infected Children on HAART, This study will examine how HIV affects the brain and nervous system learning and behavior in children on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Although HAART has resulted in fewer HIV-infected children getting sick and even fewer dying from AIDS many children on this treatment regimen develop significant brain or nervous system problems such as learning difficulties attention problems hyperactivity and depression. People who acquired HIV disease in the first decade of life and who have evidence of central nervous system (CNS) disease (e.g. encephalopathy CNS compromise ADHD bipolar disease major depression or psychosis) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination neuropsychological testing and a CT scan of the head if one has not been done within 12 months of entering the study. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  MRI and MRS scan of the head: These tests use a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain and detect changes in certain brain chemicals that may be affected by HIV infection. Both procedures are done at the same time. The patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder) wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 50 to 60 minutes during which time the patient can communicate with the staff.   -  Neuropsychological testing: Patients' thinking and behavior are evaluated with tests to measure their memory attention language problem-solving academic and motor skills and questionnaires to assess behavioral and emotional functioning quality of life and adherence to HIV medication. Parents are also asked to complete questionnaires assessing their child's behavioral and emotional functioning quality of life important life events and adherence to HIV medication.   -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected for analysis. For this procedure a local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. Some fluid is collected through the needle. Blood tests and a physical examination are done before the procedure to make sure it can be done as safely as possible. Patients may also be sedated to prevent any discomfort.   -  Follow-up: The blood tests MRI and MRS scans and spinal tap are repeated 1 and 2 years after the initial evaluation. Some blood and spinal fluid samples from participants are stored for possible future studies related to HIV research    ,NCT00110331

Moreover in in vitro testing SP01A: (1) demonstrated comparable or greater efficacy than currently approved anti-HIV drugs in preventing HIV virus replication; (2) was observed to have minimal toxic effect on human cells; and (3) demonstrated significant efficacy in preventing virus replication of HIV virus strains that resist currently approved anti-HIV treatments. Based on these results SP01A demonstrates promise as a new and novel anti-HIV treatment. The goal of this study is to further look at the dose response efficacy and safety of SP01A as monotherapy given as a capsule to be swallowed in the treatment of HIV-infected subjects. The investigators want to see if SP01A will lower the amount of HIV in blood. Subjects will be assigned by chance to 1 of 4 groups. Neither the subject nor the study doctor or nurse will know which dose of the study drug the subject is taking or if the subject is receiving the placebo (a capsule that looks like the study drug but does not contain any active ingredient). At the end of the 10-day study the subject will be offered testing of their virus for resistance to approved drugs (genotype) and transferred to their physician for continued treatment with FDA-approved antiretroviral therapies. If the subject experiences a side effect which continues past the end of the study they will be further monitored until the side effect goes away.    ,NCT00113412

HIV,Study of the HIV gp120/NefTat/AS02A Vaccine to Treat Individuals With Chronic HIV-1 Infection on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), This study will test the safety and immunogenicity of the gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine candidate in individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection successfully treated with HAART. The rationale for this study is based on previous scientific experiments including data indicating that this vaccine can elicit strong HIV-1-specific T cell immune responses in humans and monkeys and lead to a retardation of HIV-1 disease progression in animal models of HIV-1 infection. The HIV vaccine to be administered during this study consists of three recombinant HIV clade B viral antigens: the envelope glycoprotein gp120 and two regulatory proteins Nef and Tat.The antigens are formulated in a proprietary adjuvant AS02A comprised of two immunostimulants in an oil-in-water emulsion (gp120/NefTat/AS02A). The vaccine and the adjuvant are manufactured and provided for the study by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals Rixensart Belgium. The drugs will be given by intramuscular (IM) injection at a standard dose of 20 mg together with 0.5 ml of the AS02A adjuvant. Twenty HIV-1 infected individuals will be randomly enrolled into three different study groups receiving either the gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine (10 individuals) the AS02A adjuvant alone (5 individuals) or a placebo (5 individuals). After obtaining informed consent subjects will have a history and physical exam performed and have laboratory tests to confirm they meet all inclusion and exclusion entry criteria. Women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test prior to each injection of the investigational product. Injections with vaccine adjuvant alone or placebo will then be performed at weeks 0 4 and 12. Study participants will undergo close monitoring after each vaccination. Blood samples will be obtained for immunological assays at study baseline (2 times) and weeks 2 4 6 12 14 24 and 48. All patients will maintain their antiretroviral treatment regimen during the entire study period.    ,NCT00117429

HIV,Effectiveness of Nucleoside Supplementation and Substituting Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate for Other Drugs in Anti-HIV Regimens in Reversing Fat Loss in HIV Infected Adults, HIV lipoatrophy is a condition marked by fat loss; it occurs in many patients taking antiretroviral (ARV) therapy that includes nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Lipoatrophy may be related to mitochondrial toxicity a condition that can damage the heart nerves muscles kidneys and liver and can affect the body's ability to produce energy. NucleomaxX is a food supplement consisting of a sugar cane extract high in nucleosides which are building blocks that may counteract the negative effects of NRTIs. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is an NRTI that may cause less lipoatrophy than other drugs in its class such as zidovudine (ZDV) or stavudine (d4T). The purpose of this study is to determine whether nucleoside supplementation with NucleomaxX and substitution of TDF for ZDV or d4T in an ARV regimen can reverse fat loss caused by mitochondrial toxicity in HIV infected adults. Study hypotheses: 1) The substitution of TDF for d4T or ZDV in patients with HIV lipoatrophy will result in an increase in mitochondrial DNA content in fat skeletal muscle and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) which in turn will lead to an improvement in mitochondrial function as assessed by electron transport chain (ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OXPHOS) activity. The latter should lead to a decrease in fat apoptosis and in mitochondrial and lipid oxidative damage biomarkers. 2) Supplementation with uridine (via NucleomaxX) will increase mtDNA content in adipose tissue and increase body fat content.    ,NCT00119379
HIV,Observational Study of Fat Loss in HIV Infected Adults Taking Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs), Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are a class of anti-HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) drug that can be an important part of an HIV treatment regimen. Because anti-HIV therapy may have negative side effects there is a great need to carefully study HIV infected patients on such regimens. One negative side effect observed in many HIV infected patients is lipoatrophy a condition that results in fat loss in the body. It is unclear if NRTIs also have a role in the development of mitochondrial toxicity a condition that affects the body's ability to produce energy. The purpose of this study is to observe the effects of an NRTI-based protease inhibitor (PI)-sparing drug regimen on fat loss in HIV infected treatment-naive adults. Study hypothesis: The initiation of NRTI-containing PI-sparing therapy will inhibit mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesis and lead to a decrease in mtDNA content in adipose tissue skeletal muscle and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will cause deterioration in mitochondrial function will increase fat apoptosis and oxidative damage biomarkers and will lead to progressive decrease in body fat content.    ,NCT00119405

HIV,Study Comparing Racivir and Lamivudine in Treatment-Experienced HIV Subjects," Racivir ® (RCV) is an experimental drug which means it is not approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but it can be used in research studies like this one. RCV (Racivir®) is part of a class of drugs known as ""Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors"" (NRTIs) which are intended to block a further increase in the amount of HIV virus in the body. Laboratory research suggests that RCV (Racivir®) may be effective in patients who have developed resistance to other NRTIs particularly 3TC (lamivudine Epivir®). However a study of RCV (Racivir®) has not been done with patients who have previously been treated with other HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy -- taking multiple HIV drugs at once) medications including 3TC (lamivudine Epivir®). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of RCV (Racivir®) when used together with other HIV drugs in people who have previously been treated with 3TC (lamivudine Epivir®) and are failing with their current HAART treatments. This study will include a total of 60 HIV infected HAART-experienced subjects currently receiving 3TC (lamivudine Epivir®) as part of their HAART therapy. The study will take place at approximately 11 study sites in the US and Latin America.    ",NCT00121979

HIV,Effect of Multiple Micronutrient Supplementation on Growth Morbidity and Mortality of HIV Infected Children in Uganda, Micronutrient deficiencies are common in HIV infected children and are aggravated by poor nutrition especially in poor resource countries such as Uganda. It appears that micronutrient deficiencies contribute to immune dysfunction increased morbidity and HIV disease progression. Hitherto there has been no randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of multiple micronutrient supplementation on morbidity and mortality in HIV infected children in Africa. Therefore the investigators shall carry out a randomised controlled trial to determine the effect of multiple micronutrient supplementation on morbidity weight gain and mortality among HIV infected children aged 1 to 5 years in Uganda. Hypothesis: Daily administration of twice the recommended dietary allowance (2RDA) of multiple micronutrients to HIV infected children aged one to five years for 6 months will reduce all cause mortality from 24% to 14.4% in one year and result in a weight gain difference of 150 grams.    ,NCT00122941

HIV,Trial of Male Circumcision: HIV Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) and Behavioral Effects in Men Women and the Community, This randomized controlled trial conducted in Rakai District Uganda has enrolled 997 HIV positive men and 500 men who declined to learn HIV results (regardless of HIV status). The hypotheses are that male circumcision will be acceptable to and safe in both groups and will reduce the rates of STD acquisition in both groups and of HIV acquisition in HIV-negative men. Enrollment was ended on Dec 12 2006 following an interim Data Monitoring and Safety Board (DSMB) review of a closed report. At that time the DSMB determined that futility with respect to the female HIV outcome. There was an non-significantly higher rate of HIV acquisition in women partners of HIV+ men in couples who had resumed sex prior to certified post-surgical wound healing. The data indicated significant reductions (~50%) in GUD symptoms among circumcised HIV+ men. The DSMB recommended: 1) that men and women should continue to be followed in complete two year follow up on all 2) that circumcision for remaining HIV+ intervention arm men and for control arm men who had completed their 2 year follow should continue contingent on a) revision of the study protocol to add additional post-surgical visits to assess wound healing b) protocol revision to further strengthen education for both male and female partners on the need to postpone sex until certified wound healing and c) approval of the revised protocol by the IRBs in both the US and Uganda. 3) An additional follow up visit for women be instituted at 18 months after enrollment. Protocol revision and IRB approvals have been finalized in June 2007. The study has also enrolled and is following 3700 women sexual partners of men enrolled in this study and in a complementary National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded study (U1 AI51171 which is separately registered).

HIV,A Pharmacokinetic (PK) Study of a Combination of Indinavir Ritonavir and Amprenavir, When individuals who are infected with HIV are started on treatment with HIV medications the effect of these drugs only lasts for a limited period of time often because of development of drug resistance by the HIV virus. When this happens such patients have to be switched to different combinations of HIV medications. However since the availability of new HIV drugs that are active against resistant virus is limited HIV care providers are resorting to curtail medications that contain three or more protease inhibitors (PIs). The reason for this is Norvir (ritonavir) a PI that has the ability to boost or increase the blood levels of other PIs in a way that can sometimes overcome the resistance of HIV virus. In addition it may be more difficult for the virus to overcome two or more drugs with high blood levels than it is to overcome just one. For these reasons many clinicians are now using Norvir in combination with two other PIs including Crixivan (indinavir) plus Lexiva (fosamprenavir) for treating patients who have been exposed to many other HIV medications. While this may be the case researchers also know that when two or more PIs are combined the effects each drug may have on the blood level of other drugs could be different. For example researchers know from some recent studies that the combination of Norvir Lexiva and Kaletra another PI leads to an unacceptably low level of both Kaletra and Lexiva. Because researchers can not always assume that when multiple HIV medications are combined the levels will remain high enough to be effective the investigators think it will always be reasonable that before any combination of drugs are used on HIV-infected patients the effect a combination has on the levels of each of the drugs in the combination should be investigated. AIMS: The aim of this pilot study therefore is to examine the blood levels of Crixivan Lexiva and Norvir when these three drugs are used together as part of a combination treatment for HIV infection. METHODS: Fifteen (15) HIV-infected volunteers already being treated with a Crixivan and Norvir containing regimen will be recruited from the Grady Infectious Disease Clinic (IDP). Lexiva will be added to this regimen for 5 days at the end of which participants will be admitted to the Grady General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) where blood samples will be collected at 9 different time points over 12 hours for measurement of blood drug levels. Pharmacokinetic Analysis: The blood concentrations of Crixivan Lexiva and Norvir will be measured by a special technique known as reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Statistical Analysis: The blood level information will be summarized by a statistical method. The researchers will then compare the levels of Lexiva in this combination with historically published levels of Lexiva in a study of Lexiva plus Norvir; and that of Crixivan in a study of Crixivan plus Norvir. A difference of 30% or more in drug levels between this study and historical reports will be considered a significant difference.    ,NCT00148785

HIV,ARVs to Prevent Breastmilk HIV:Viral and Immune Responses, Identifying new approaches for preventing breastmilk transmission of HIV-1 is an important research priority. To this end clinical trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy of HAART (zidovudine lamivudine nevirapine) during late pregnancy/lactation versus zidovudine/nevirapine peripartum for prevention of breastmilk HIV-1 transmission. It is important to understand the mechanism of effect of these antiretroviral (ARV) strategies on prevention of breastmilk HIV-1 transmission. This phase II trial will compare HAART vs peripartum zidovudine/nevirapine for effect on breastmilk HIV-1 breastmilk HIV-1 specific immune responses and infant HIV-1 specific immune responses. 100 pregnant HIV-1 seropositive women in Nairobi with CD4 counts between 200 to 500 who have chosen to breastfeed will receive either ARV regimen. Mother-infant pairs will be followed for 1 year after delivery. Home visits will be conducted in the first month (~10 visits) to collect 2-5 mls of breastmilk per visit. Mother-infant pairs will be seen in the study clinic with maternal blood and breastmilk and infant blood collected at months 1 3 and 6 for HIV-1 and HIV-1 Elispot assays. Breastmilk HIV-1 RNA and DNA levels will be quantified in Dr. Overbaugh's laboratory in Seattle and Elispot assays conducted in Nairobi with validation of a subset in Dr. Rowland-Jones laboratory in Oxford. Viral loads decay curves half-life and re-population following ARV cessation will be estimated for each regimen and regimens compared. These studies will provide insight into the viral and immune responses to ARV regimens proposed for prevention of breastfeeding HIV-1 transmission and will be important for rational design of future interventions. After taking into account estimated loss to follow-up the targeted sample size with outcome data was 80 women 40 in each trial arm estimating undetectable breast milk HIV-1 RNA levels in the HAART arm and median breast milk HIV-1 RNA levels of 3.0 log10 in women receiving ZDV/NVP.    ,NCT00167674

HIV,Screening for HIV-Associated Anal Cancer, Cancer of the anus occurs at very high rates in young men with HIV and is caused by a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV). Anal cancer has increased during the HIV epidemic despite effective therapies for HIV. Unfortunately anal cancer presents at a late stage because there is no screening program to find it at an early stage. Rates of other cancers such as cervical cancer have been reduced through the use of Pap smears. The researchers' plan is to do the same type of screening for anal cancer as has been done for cervical cancer. If abnormalities are found then treatment can be started. The researchers hope that this approach will help to prevent anal cancer. Testing for HPV will also be done to see if this helps to detect early cancer and to see how accurate different tests pathologists and clinical examiners are at detecting and agreeing on any abnormalities. The main outcome is the presence of any pre-cancerous or early cancer changes as determined by high resolution anoscopy (HRA). HRA involves looking through a microscope into the anus and this allows very tiny changes to be identified. Pieces of tissue can then be taken to make a definite diagnosis.    ,NCT00188292

HIV,A Randomised Open-label Trial to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Switching to Tenofovir-emtricitabine or Abacavir-lamivudine: The STEAL Study, Combination antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV has a high pill burden. Two dual-tablets abacavir-lamivudine and tenofovir-emtricitabine are now licensed in the United States and will be available in Australia in December 2005. Data available suggest that the potency of these tablets are similar in controlling replication of the HIV virus but not have not been directly compared in regard to clinically significant toxicities. We therefore aim to compare the overall safety and efficacy of the two dual-tablets over a 2 year period in HIV infected adults. We hypothesise that the two dual-NRTI treatments will be similar in efficacy and safety.    ,NCT00192634
HIV,Effect of Medication Diaries on Adherence to Highly Active Antiretroviral Drugs Among HIV-1 Infected Kenyan Children, Following significant reduction in antiretroviral drug prices over the past two years more HIV-1 infected African adults and children are gaining access to treatment. However due to complex drug regimens that have to be taken continuously suboptimal adherence is likely to be a formidable challenge. As programs providing antiretroviral drugs in Africa scale up achievement of excellent adherence is a high priority as this will result in maximum benefits from the drugs and forestall development of resistant virus. A better understanding of predictors of pediatric HAART adherence in African children is essential in order to formulate feasible culturally appropriate strategies to monitor and enhance adherence. There is also urgent need to evaluate simple inexpensive interventions that are widely applicable in the African setting. The medication diary has been used empirically among HIV infected adults and children in Western countries mainly as a tool for monitoring and to a lesser extent improving HAART adherence. Literacy levels have risen significantly in most African regions over the past few years and the diary can also be further modified using pictures to suit parents of different literacy levels. We propose to conduct a randomized control trial to determine the effect of medication diaries and counseling versus counseling alone on HAART-adherence in HIV-1 infected children and their parents/caregivers in Nairobi Kenya.    ,NCT00194545

HIV,Evaluation of Brain Lesions in HIV-infected Patients for Diagnosis of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma, This study will evaluate the usefulness of two tests in quickly distinguishing whether a patient with HIV infection and focal brain lesions (an injury in a specific area of the brain) has a rare type of cancer called primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) or a parasitic infection called toxoplasmic encephalitis. Toxoplasmic encephalitis is caused by a parasite and can be treated with antibiotics. PCNSL (lymphoma of the brain or spinal cord) must be definitively diagnosed with a brain biopsy (removal of a small piece of brain tissue) and the treatment is radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The tests under study for diagnosing PCNSL or toxoplasmic encephalitis are measurement of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and FDG-PET scan of the brain. EBV is often found in the CSF of people with PCNSL. The study also will compare the accuracy of two imaging techniques-TI-SPECT and FDG-PET-in distinguishing between toxoplasmosis and PCNSL. Patients 18 years of age and older who have HIV infection and at least one focal brain lesion without a prior history of PCNSL or toxoplasmic encephalitis may be eligible for this study. Each candidate is screened with a medical history physical examination blood and urine tests and MRI scans of the brain. Upon entering the study all participants take medication to treat toxoplasmic encephalitis. They undergo lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to obtain CSF for analysis an FDG-PET scan and a 201TI-SPECT scan. For the PET scan a radioactive substance is injected into an arm followed by scanning in a doughnut-shaped machine similar to a CT scanner. SPECT is similar to PET but uses a different radioactive tracer and the patient lies on a table while the SPECT camera rotates around the patient's head. Patients whose test results indicate a low risk for lymphoma continue antibiotic therapy for toxoplasmosis. They have repeat MRI scans around 4 7 and 14 days after starting the drug to monitor the response to therapy. Antiretroviral therapy is initiated in patients who are not already on such a regimen. Patients whose test results indicate a high risk for PCNSL have a CT scan to look for evidence of lymphoma elsewhere in the body and are referred for consultation with a neurosurgeon to discuss undergoing a brain biopsy. The brain biopsy is done in the operating room under general anesthesia. A small cut is made in the scalp and a small opening is made in the skull over the area of the brain to be biopsied. A needle is placed in the opening in the skull and guided by CT or MRI moved to the abnormal area of the brain where a small piece of tissue is removed for study under a microscope. Patients found to have toxoplasmosis are discharged from the hospital to the care of their primary care physician after they are getting better and are tolerating all their medications. They return to NIH for follow-up visits about 4 weeks and 6 months after discharge. Patients found to have lymphoma are referred to the National Cancer Institute for screening for enrollment in a treatment protocol. Patients who are not eligible for a treatment protocol are referred back to their primary care physician or for another NIH treatment protocol if one is available. Patients with lymphoma are seen at the NIAID outpatient clinic for follow-up visits and laboratory examinations every 3 months for 2 years.    ,NCT00226304

HIV,Controlling Acute or Early HIV Infection With Antiretroviral Drugs Without a Candidate Vaccine.As Reported Previously the Candidate Vaccie Was Not Provided by the Maufacturer as Promised, The purpose of this study is to determine the role of HIV-specific CD4 T cell responses and immune responses dependent upon these CD4 responses that develop when antiretroviral drugs are started during acute or recent HIV infection whether these CD4 responses can be enhanced with a therapeutic HIV vaccine (HIV-1 immunogen) and what pattern of HIV-specific immune responses is associated with control of HIV upon discontinuation of antiretroviral drugs during an analytical therapeutic interruption. Participants will be treatment-naive adults with acute or early HIV infection who will choose to start or not start anti-HIV drugs at the beginning of the study. NOTE: In August 2007 we were notified by the manufacturer of the candidate vaccine that they were no longer making the vaccine and that the vaccine would no longer be available. Unfortunately too few participants have received either the vaccine or placebo to conclude anything about efficacy. No safety problems occurred.    ,NCT00238459

HIV,Evaluation of Atazanavir Substitution Intervention (EASI) Study, With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) it was hypothesized that its consistent use could lead to a cure for HIV infection in as little as three years [Perelson 1997]. Subsequent research has shown this model to be incorrect [Finzi 1999]. In addition long term use of HAART has now been associated with significant metabolic abnormalities which could lead to unintended morbidity possibly worse than what one could expect from the progression of untreated HIV-associated immune disease over the same period of time [Carr 2000]. Accordingly current recommendations for antiretroviral therapy have become more conservative. It is now suggested that a person with a CD4 count > 350 cells/mm³ may safely delay initiation of HAART [Yeni 2002].However for those who still require HAART the risks of short-term and long-term toxicities remain even if full virologic suppression is achieved. In this setting a number of switching strategies have been evaluated (Negredo et al 2002 & Martinez et al 2003) mostly involving single drug substitutions of a protease inhibitor (PI) for a non-nucleoside agent (NNRTI) or abacavir (ABC). In general terms these hae shown that virologic suppression is usually maintained with improvement in drug-related side effects including metabolic toxicities. A number of patients who are currently taking effective HAART are experiencing side effects to one or more of the agents in their regimen that is not severe enough to mandate an immediate change in their regimen but that is having a measurable effect on their qualify of life. Over time these effects may have an impact on adherence to therapy and its long-term efficacy. Given the recent availability of ATV (+/-RTV) its once daily administration low pill count and favourable side effect profile it is being used in clinical practice as part of single drug substitution strategies in patients exhibiting a maximal response to HAART. There is a clear need to examine this practice in a systematic manner to document its occurrence efficacy and safety. We hypothesize that in patients with maximal virologic suppression on a double class regimen (including two NRTIs and an NNRTI or a PI boosted with RTV or not) and in whom a decision has been made to implement a single drug substitution of the NNRTI or PI for ATV (+/-) this will lead to an improvement in objectively measured quality of life without any negative impact on the virologic efficacy of the regimen.    ,NCT00247845

HIV,ADAPT-POL New Orleans: Adaptation of Prevention Techniques With Popular Opinion Leader, Adopting and Demonstrating the Adaptation of Prevention Techniques (ADAPT) is a supplement to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Community Based Organization Program Announcement 04064 (PA 04064). The purpose of ADAPT is to improve the understanding of the processes needed for adapting evidence-based behavioral interventions to fit new conditions or populations and to pilot the CDC-developed adaptation guidance. The ADAPT project responds to concerns from the field that existing interventions do not address the HIV prevention needs of their specific population. This project seeks to develop guidance for agencies to engage in the evidence-based adaptation of interventions previously shown to be effective in evaluation settings for use in real world applications. The New Orleans AIDS Task Force (NO/AIDS) is one of five grantees funded to use the adaptation guidance to adapt an intervention packaged by the CDC's Replicating Effective Programs and disseminated by CDC's Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions. The agency will adapt Jeff Kelly's Popular Opinion Leader (POL) intervention (Kelly 2004; Kelly et al. 1991) for use in Internet venues with seropositive men who identify ethnically/racially as other than White/Caucasian who have sex with other men (men who have sex with men [MSM] of color). Kelly's POL intervention is a community-level evidence-based HIV prevention intervention that originally targeted gay and bisexual men in smaller cities throughout the United States. Kelly's intervention seeks to identify and enlist the support of well-known and well-liked opinion leaders to take on risk reduction advocacy roles. Opinion leaders attend sessions to learn how to engage in risk reduction conversations with people in their own social networks. The opinion leaders help to reshape social norms to encourage safer sex by helping to create a social environment in which MSM feel comfortable and empowered to make decisions to avoid high-risk sexual behaviors.    ,NCT00252109

HIV,Reducing HIV & Domestic Violence Risk in Women Offenders, The long-term goal of this work is to reduce the prevalence of HIV and domestic violence among women at risk by encouraging self-protective behaviors. To obtain this goal Multnomah County Health Department and Oregon Department of Human Services have conducted a randomized trial of an intervention to prevent HIV and domestic violence among women who have recent criminal justice involvement and who are at risk for HIV infection. Women enrolled in the study were randomly assigned to one of three study conditions:   -  Group 1: these women received information on local resources addressing HIV prevention domestic violence and life stability issues; they did not receive any counseling sessions as part of the study itself.   -  Group 2: these women received up to ten supportive counseling sessions based on the techniques of motivational interviewing. These sessions aimed to reduce HIV risk and to improve life stability.   -  Group 3: these women received up to ten supportive counseling sessions based on motivational interviewing. These sessions aimed to reduce risk for HIV and domestic violence and to improve life stability. The primary hypotheses of this study were:   -  1. Supportive counseling (motivational interviewing) addressing HIV prevention and increased life stability will lead to reductions of HIV risk behavior among women enrolled in the study.   -  2. Supportive counseling (motivational interviewing) addressing domestic violence prevention HIV prevention and increased life stability will bring about reductions in experiences of domestic violence and a reduction of HIV risk among these women.   -  3. The supportive counseling received in this study will enhance these women's self-efficacy self-esteem and psychological well-being. Women in all three experimental groups were interviewed at the beginning of the study and again after 4 7 and 10 months. These assessment interviews asked questions about: HIV risk; experiences of domestic violence; and life stability issues such as education employment and housing; and included biological testing for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. Women in Group 2 and Group 3 participated in up to 10 sessions of supportive counseling (motivational interviewing) between the time of enrollment and the 4-month interviews.    ,NCT00289939

HIV,Intensification With Enfuvirtide in Naive HIV-infected Patients (ANRS130), HIV infection is diagnosed late in a substantial proportion of patients having an increased risk of clinical progression (AIDS new AIDS-defining event or death). The currently recommended antiretroviral therapy has suboptimal activity in this setting and potent quadruple-drug therapy has not been sufficiently evaluated. Enfuvirtide may be an appropriate candidate as the fourth antiretroviral agent regarding its activity its parenteral administration avoiding gastrointestinal symptoms that often lead to interruption of treatment the lack of pharmacokinetic interactions and the absence of systemic toxicity. The aim of this study is to investigate in a comparative intensification trial the immunological benefit of adding enfuvirtide for 6 months to a conventional antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1 infected and severely immunosuppressed patients naïve of any antiretroviral treatment. We postulate that addition of enfuvirtide to a first-line antiretroviral therapy consisting in emtricitabine/tenofovir combined with either efavirenz or lopinavir/r may improve immunological restoration measured as the proportion of patients with more than 200 CD4 cells per mm3 after 24 weeks of antiretroviral therapy.    ,NCT00302822

HIV,Investigating the Anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) & Anti-inflammatory Effect of Chloroquine, Summary: Chloroquine is a medication that in laboratory settings has significant anti-HIV effects in HIV infected T-cells. Chloroquine has been used safely for over 60 years for malaria treatment and prevention and it also has significant anti-inflammatory effects. No formal study of chloroquine has been performed in people with HIV infection. Chloroquine is used worldwide and is quite inexpensive outside of the United States. If shown to be effective chloroquine could be a very important tool worldwide in delaying HIV disease progression which would extend the time period without needing anti-retroviral therapy. In countries where anti-retroviral therapy is not available this could be very helpful. This is an 8 week trial study requiring 3 study visits. Participants will be ask to take a once a day study medication (chloroquine or placebo) for 8 weeks and have three blood draws for CD4 counts HIV viral loads and other research tests. The visits are at study enrollment 4 weeks and 8 weeks.    ,NCT00308620

HIV,Study of Once Daily Elvucitabine Versus Lamivudine in Subjects With a Documented M184V Mutation, HIV-1 infected patients receiving long-term therapy with lamivudine or emtricitabine (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs]) are at risk for the development of a mutation at position M184 on the HIV reverse transcriptase gene. This mutation confers resistance to both drugs (> 100 fold increase in IC50). In-vitro studies with elvucitabine have shown that HIV-1 isolates with the M184V mutation show only a 10-fold increase in IC50 as compared to wild type HIV-1. Achillion Pharmaceutical's intention is to demonstrate that 10 mg of elvucitabine administered once per day for 14 days with continued background anti-HIV-1 medications will demonstrate a fall in HIV-1 RNA plasma levels as compared to baseline. The data from this study will guide dosing in future long-term studies in HIV-1 infected patients with the M184V mutation.    ,NCT00312039

HIV,Phase I Study of Vaccination Schedule of Experimental HIV Vaccines," This study will test whether a vaccination schedule of experimental HIV vaccines is safe and whether it causes side effects in healthy adult volunteers. It will also compare the effects of vaccine injected into the muscle (intramuscular) just under the skin (subcutaneous) or into the skin (intradermal) and will monitor the social impact of being in an HIV vaccine study. Healthy volunteers 18-50 years old may be eligible for this 42-week study. Participants are screened for antibodies to adenovirus a common virus that causes upper respiratory infections such as the common cold. Half of the participants selected will be positive and half will be negative for antibodies to the virus. The vaccines used in this study are known as VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP (called the ""DNA vaccine"") and VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (called the ""rAd5 vaccine""). The DNA vaccine codes for four HIV proteins. The rAd5 vaccine is made using an adenovirus that has been modified to contain DNA that codes for three HIV proteins. These vaccines cannot cause HIV or adenoviral infections. Participants are randomly assigned to one of six possible vaccination schedules that include ""prime"" and ""booster"" vaccines. The first vaccinations prime the immune system and the immune response is then boosted later. The groups differ in the type of vaccines given (DNA vaccine prime with rAd5 booster or rAd5 prime with rAd5 booster) in how the vaccine is administered (intramuscularly subcutaneously or intradermally) and in the schedule of administration. All shots are given in the upper arm. Subjects fill out a diary card at home for 5 days after each vaccination recording their temperature and any symptoms. The cards are turned in to the clinic at the first visit after all 5 days are completed.

HIV,The Effect of Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) Vaccination on Immune Responses in HIV-Exposed and Unexposed Infants, Background: Each year more than half a million babies are infected with HIV by mother-to child transmission in developing countries. Many of these babies get sick and develop HIV disease (AIDS) at a very young age. Exposure to other infectious diseases may influence this early progression to AIDS. BCG is a live tuberculosis vaccine made from cow tuberculosis. It is routinely given at birth to most babies also to babies born to HIV-positive mothers. BCG can cause disease (BCGosis) in HIV-infected babies. More importantly BCG may also trigger immune responses in the body that lead to the spread of the HIV virus and early progression to AIDS. Objective(s) and Hypothesis: The researchers will investigate whether BCG causes progression of HIV by doing a clinical trial: babies born to HIV-positive mothers will be randomly allocated to get the BCG vaccine at birth or at 14 weeks of age. In these 2 groups of babies the researchers will compare:   -  The percentage of babies who progress to HIV disease   -  Blood markers of HIV disease (the amount of virus and protective white blood cells in the body)   -  The body's immune response to BCG vaccine and other childhood vaccines   -  The percentage of children who develop BCG scarring BCG vaccine complications and tuberculosis. Potential Impact: BCG is the most widely given vaccine worldwide and is routinely given to babies born to HIV-positive mothers in developing countries. Any effect that BCG has on HIV progression in babies will have a significant public health impact in settings with a high burden of HIV disease.    ,NCT00331474

HIV,Pharmacokinetic (PK) Study of Single-dose Rosuvastatin and Tipranavir/Ritonavir in Healthy Subjects, Tipranavir (TPV) plus ritonavir (RTV) is indicated for use as part of an antiretroviral treatment regimen for resistant HIV-1 infection in adult patients. Since significant cholesterol and triglyceride elevations are commonly reported during TPV/RTV treatment effective treatment strategies are critical to prevent long-term cardiovascular events. Rosuvastatin a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor is unlikely to interact with TPV/RTV since it is not extensively metabolized however a formal drug interaction study is needed before this combination can be recommended. This study will examine the pharmacokinetic interactions between tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/RTV [TPV/r] 500 mg/200 mg twice daily [B.I.D]) and single dose rosuvastatin when the two are co-administered to healthy adult volunteers.

HIV,Viral Load Determination and Biomarkers of High Risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) - Types in HIV-positive Men, Human papillomavirus (HPV)-infection belongs to the most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. HIV-infected men having sex with men (MSM) are strongly associated with a higher prevalence of genital HPV-infection a higher incidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) and consecutively an increased risk for anal cancer. Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) the incidence of several viral-associated neoplasias has significantly fallen in HIV-infected individuals. At the beginning of the era of HAART a justified hope existed that genitoanal HPV-related neoplasias would also decrease based on the success of HAART-induced immune restoration. However HAART seems to have only a small impact on the natural history of AIN as observed in a cohort of HIV-positive MSM before and after the initiation of HAART. As AIN and cancer precursor lesions of the cervix cervical intraepithelial neoplasia share distinct clinical similarities cytologic smear testing for AIN has been recommended to detect and treat early lesions. Thus this prospective study mainly focuses on the predictive value of HPV-DNA load for the development and clinical progression of AIN in HIV-infected MSM. Moreover the course of HPV viral load under therapy for anal intraepithelial neoplasia e.g. topical treatment with imiquimod will be evaluated. Additionally immunohistochemical determination of several proliferative biomarkers as well as cytokines will be performed.    ,NCT00365729

HIV,Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Recombinant Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) Virus to Treat HIV Infection, At the end of 2004 there were more than 40 million people infected worldwide with HIV with an estimated 16000 new infections every day (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS [UNAIDS] 2004). The HIV epidemic threatens whole societies particularly in Africa and Asia and rates of infections in the Western countries have also increased over the last few years. However despite more than 15 years of research an effective vaccine against HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has still not been developed. There is considerable evidence that cellular immune responses can effectively control HIV-1 replication during acute and chronic infections thereby possibly protecting individuals from infection and preventing the spread of HIV. To be truly effective in the general population a vaccine must induce responses specific to immunologically conserved regions. The epitope-based vaccine MVA-mBN32 represents a very logical approach to this problem because of its potential to elicit a polyfunctional immune response and to focus these responses to conserved epitopes. In this study the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a recombinant MVA-BN® vaccine expressing cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes of HIV-1 (MVA-mBN32) in 36 healthy volunteers will be examined. This will include a full analysis of CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ CTL responses to these epitopes to establish the potential of such a homologous prime-boost vaccine approach to induce a broad cell-mediated response to different HIV antigens.    ,NCT00386633
HIV,BLADE: Comparison of Once Daily Lopinavir/Ritonavir to Lopinavir/Ritonavir BID Dosing in HIV-Infected Subjects, The goal of this study is to evaluate the proportion of subjects both antiretroviral experienced and virologically suppressed on lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)400/100mg twice daily who maintain viral suppression after switching to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)800/200mg once daily. The hypothesis for this study is that the majority of subjects will remain virologically suppressed with once daily dosing versus twice daily dosing and therefore quality of life will be improved with the once daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)800/200mg.    ,NCT00388492
HIV,PREventing Progression of Adipose Tissue Redistribution, The main objective of the study is to assess changes in fat distribution over 48 weeks of treatment in patients who currently successfully use zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) as part of their regimen and who will either continue these antiretrovirals or who will switch these antiretrovirals to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC).

HIV,Nevirapine or Atazanavir/Ritonavir Given With Emtricitabine/Tenofovir in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1-infected Treatment Naive Adults, Primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of two different nevirapine (Viramune) dosing regimens (once daily (QD) and twice daily (BID) application) and of atazanavir/ritonavir (Reyataz/Norvir) all on an emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) (Truvada) background. Patients will receive either nevirapine (NVP) 200 mg twice daily or NVP 400 mg once daily  or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATZ/r) all in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir DF (TDF). All patients receiving NVP will start at 200 mg once daily for 2 weeks because it has been demonstrated that this lead-in dosing regimen reduces the frequency of NVP-induced rash. At Visit 3 (Week 2) patients increase the NVP dose to either 200 mg twice daily or to 400 mg once daily. Patients receiving ATZ/r will be treated with ATZ 300 mg once daily boosted by 100 mg ritonavir (RTV) once daily. Background antiretroviral therapy for all patients consists of one tablet of Truvada. Treatment duration is 48 weeks (primary endpoint) with an extension to 144 weeks. Patients may also participate in the metabolic sub-study comparing NVP and ATZ/r for signs and symptoms of lipodystrophy and serum lipid/glycaemic abnormalities.    ,NCT00389207

Patients were randomized into one of the following prophylactic treatment groups: isoniazid for six months (6H) rifampin plus isoniazid for three months (3RH) rifampin plus pyrazinamide for two months (2RZ) or no treatment (NT). After completion of treatment patients were followed up for two years.    ,NCT00402610
HIV,Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR): Multi-sponsor Registry to Detect Any Major Teratogenic Effect Involving Any of the Registry Drugs When Administered to Pregnant Women., The purpose of the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (Registry) is to detect any major teratogenic effect involving any of the Registry drugs when administered to pregnant women. Registration is voluntary and confidential with information obtained from the health care provider. A Registry-assigned identifier allows for follow-up capability. Information on subjects is provided to the Registry prospectively (prior to the outcome of pregnancy being known) through their health care provider with follow-up obtained from the health care provider after the outcome is determined. Providers are strongly urged to enroll their patients as early in pregnancy as possible to maximize the validity of the data. In addition the Registry is very interested in assembling a group of providers who are willing to make a commitment to report all of their site's antiretroviral pregnancy exposures to the Registry thereby assuring all cases can be considered prospective. Providers are encouraged to contact the Registry for more information about this group. The Registry is informed in its analysis by other data for example retrospective reports and clinical studies. Given the increasing number of medications and more aggressive approach to therapy more HIV-infected women may be treated during pregnancy or become pregnant while under treatment. The paucity of data on use and infant outcomes of antiretroviral therapies during pregnancy makes this Registry an essential component of the ongoing program of epidemiologic studies of the safety of these therapies. Each year the Registry has enrolled approximately 1300 pregnant women in the US exposed to antiretroviral drugs. This number represents approximately 15% of the 8700 HIV positive women who give birth to live infants annually in the US.    ,NCT00404989

HIV,Acyclovir to Treat Patients Co-infected With HIV and Herpes Viruses in Uganda," This study will determine whether acyclovir a medicine used to treat herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) can slow down the progression (worsening) of HIV disease in people with both HIV and HSV-2 infections. HSV-2 increases the amount of HIV virus in the blood of infected people and may make HIV progress faster. The study will evaluate: ""Whether people who take acyclovir can avoid antiretroviral treatment until later in their lives ""Whether people who take acyclovir get fewer genital ulcers ""How well people are able to take acyclovir and any side effects they experience from it ""Differences in the amount of HIV virus in the blood of patients who are and are not taking acyclovir and how HIV/AIDS is different in these patients. People 18 years of age and older living in the Rakai district of Uganda who are infected with both HIV (early stage disease) and HSV-2 may be eligible for this study. Participants are randomly assigned to take the study drug acyclovir or a placebo (look-alike pill with no active ingredient) daily for 2 years. During this time they visit the clinic once a month for a routine physical examination. Patients who develop genital ulcers or complications of HIV are treated for the problem and patients whose HIV disease progresses requiring them to begin antiretroviral therapy are treated accordingly.

HIV,Efficacy Study of T Cell Vaccination in HIV Infection, The hallmark of HIV infection and AIDS is the continuous attrition of CD4 T cells. One of the mechanisms that may account for the CD4 attrition  is autoimmunity against the CD4 T cells caused by autologous immune cells. Vaccination against autoimmune reactive T cells has been successfully tried in animal models of autoimmune diseases and is now being tried in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. The purpose of the present study is to test this hypothesis in HIV infection. We will vaccinate HIV infected patients in whom specific autoimmune reactivity against CD4 is present  with their own CD4 reactive T cells. Following that we shall study the patients and find out if the T cell vaccination caused a rise in CD4 T cell levels and whether it influenced HIV viral load as well as HIV and CD4 specific immunity.    ,NCT00407836

HIV,An Enhanced Adherence Support Programme for Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), In southern Africa TB is the most common first AIDS-defining condition. Initiating Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV positive TB patients will lead to the inclusion of the majority of HIV/AIDS patients currently fulfilling the criteria for therapy. Establishing an effective intervention to increase treatment adherence in this group is essential for the successful roll out of ART in the region. This proposed randomized controlled study aims to compare the effectiveness of two adherence support programmes (ASP) for use in patients with HIV-related TB in the context of CAPRISA AIDS Treatment (CAT)programme in KwaZulu-Natal South Africa; the enhanced adherence support programme (E-ASP) or the standard adherence support programme (S-ASP). S-ASP consists of three counselor presented group education sessions. E-ASP is an extension of S-ASP and is based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model of Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy a theoretical model initially developed to reduce HIV risk behavior. The E-ASP will consist of several interconnected components: 1) development and maintenance of an educational and supportive milieu at the CDC Clinic 2) provision of five structured educational support and behavioral skills building sessions and (3) three weekly ART planning sessions.    ,NCT00408642

HIV,Pharmacokinetic Study of 2 Doses of ATV/r OD + 2 NRTIs in Thai HIV-1 Infected Patients, Several studies from HIV-NAT have demonstrated high nevirapine indinavir saquinavir and lopinavir/r levels when compared to Caucasian patients. Until now the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir have not been explored in a Thai population. We postulate that ATV levels as with other PIs are higher in Thai people. Therefore the level of ATV in ATV/RTV 300/100 OD may be higher than the acceptable range and could be associated with ATV related toxicity.    ,NCT00411957
HIV,A Long-term Follow-up of the HIV-NAT Cohort, With HIV/AIDS increasingly considered a chronic disease 24- or 48-week data from antiretroviral studies are no longer sufficient. Only with long-term follow-up and outcome data will shed some much-needed light on the answers of questions that have stumped us for several years. Data from a large observational cohort of patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy will provide further insights into the long-term safety and durability of various antiretroviral therapeutic approached the efficacy of HIV viral load and CD4 cell counts as predictors of disease progression and mortality and the importance of adherence.    ,NCT00411983

HIV,Drug Interaction Study Between Atovaquone and Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1 Infected Patients, Malarone® (atovaquone/proguanil) is frequently used in malaria prophylaxis. Unfortunately there are indications that certain anti-HIV agents may decrease atovaquone plasma levels by induction of atovaquone metabolism. For travelling HIV patients the clinical consequences of these possible drug drug interactions are serious since a diminished exposure to the anti-malarial drug will result in suboptimal prophylaxis of malaria and potential development of drug resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The purpose of this study is to find out if HIV patients using HAART regimes with either lopinavir/ritonavir atazanavir/ritonavir or efavirenz have lower atovaquone plasma levels than healthy volunteers after a single dose of atovaquone/proguanil.    ,NCT00421473

HIV,Optimizing Pediatric HIV-1 Treatment in Infants With Prophylactic Exposure to Nevirapine Nairobi Kenya, Globally children who acquire HIV-1 increasingly do so in the context of maternal antiretroviral prophylaxis. It is important to determine whether maternal antiretroviral prophylaxis should alter infant treatment regimens. Nevirapine (NVP) is commonly used for PMTCT and is also a commonly used first-line drug for treatment of pediatric HIV-1. Approximately half of infants exposed to NVP have detectable NVP resistance early in infancy with loss of detectable resistance over time. Thus if an HIV-1 infected child was exposed to single-dose NVP prophylaxis the question remains whether NVP or any NNRTI can be used effectively in therapeutic regimens. Alternative PI-based regimens are associated with heat-lability poor palatability cumulative toxicity and fewer salvage options. This poses challenges for pediatric PI-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in settings without refrigeration and limited antiretroviral repertoire. It is plausible that in older NVP-exposed infants (older than 6 months since exposure) who are genotypically NVP-susceptible that nevirapine will be effective and useful. We propose to study resistance in a pediatric HIV-1 clinical trial involving 100 children. Among children enrolled at between 6 and 18 months of age we will provide real-time field-based genotypic NVP-resistance testing and randomize 100 NVP-susceptible children to NVP-containing versus NVP-sparing HAART to compare therapeutic response adverse events and morbidity in the 2 arms during 2-year follow-up. Follow-up in these studies will be closely monitored by an external Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).    ,NCT00427297
HIV,Optimizing Pediatric HIV-1 Treatment Nairobi Kenya, Given the high mortality associated with infant HIV-1 and the fact that surrogate markers are poorly predictive of mortality riskempiric highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation is started in infants younger than 12 months. A problem with this approach is that it obligates infants to life-long therapy which may be associated with cumulative drug toxicity poor adherence and treatment failure. Early HAART for prevention of mortality during the first 2 years of life has potential to salvage immune function and alter viral set-point allowing withdrawal of therapy perhaps for several years until subsequent CD4% decline requires it. This untested approach is attractive because it combines the survival benefits of early pediatric HAART therapy with the benefits of antiretroviral deferral. One hundred and fifty infants who initiated HAART at <13 months of age will be treated with HAART regimen for 24 months after which those who have immune reconstitution and adequate growth (~100) will be randomized to continued versus deferred therapy. Clinical outcomes growth and toxicity will be compared in these children to determine if interruption is a safe and beneficial strategy. Follow-up in this studies will be closely monitored by an external Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).    ,NCT00428116

HIV,Effects of Treatment With Aprepitant (Emend®) in HIV Infected Individuals, The investigators' in vitro data suggest that Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists like aprepitant will decrease the expression of CCR5 an essential co-receptor in the life cycle of HIV in the surface of macrophages and lymphocytes to levels at least similar to those observed in patients heterozygous for the CCR5 32 mutation. Together with a direct potential antiviral effect this could alter disease progression in patients with HIV infection. The investigators' hypothesis is that aprepitant is safe tolerable and has antiviral activity in HIV infected individuals. This is randomized placebo controlled double blind study to determine the safety and antiviral activity of aprepitant by comparing the change in HIV RNA viral load after 2 weeks of aprepitant monotherapy. 27 HIV infected males and females ??18 years old who have early infection with CD4 cell counts ??350 cells/mm3. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive two different doses of aprepitant (Emend®) or placebo.    ,NCT00428519
HIV,Effect of Nutritional Intervention on the Lipid Profile of HIV-Positive Patients Who Start HAART: a Randomized Trial, Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-positive patients is associated with the development of dyslipidemia a risk factor for cardiovascular events.

HIV,Retinal Oxygen Reactivity in Patients Infected With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Ocular lesions including cotton wool spots and retinal hemorrhage are a common feature of HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The aetiology of these apparently vasoocclusive phenomena in HIV related retinopathy is not well understood. Several hypotheses including infectious damage of the retinal vasculature and altered retinal hemodynamics have been postulated. The latter would be compatible with the theory that the retina of HIV patients is hypoxic. However direct measurement of oxygen tension in the retina is not possible and indirect methods have to be employed. The study objective was to investigate the reactivity in retinal blood flow to 100% oxygen breathing in patients with HIV.    ,NCT00431548

HIV,A Comparison of Adherence Rates to Ritonavir and Its Accompanying Protease Inhibitor, Pharmacologic boosting of protease inhibitors with ritonavir has become standard practice in antiretroviral therapy. Patients are instructed to take ritonavir at the same time as its accompanying protease inhibitor. However ritonavir is unpopular with many patients because of its large size and because of the recommended need for refrigeration. This study will test the hypothesis that adherence to ritonavir is inferior to adherence to its accompanying protease inhibitor in patients receiving such therapy.    ,NCT00432783
HIV,Behavior Change and Maintenance Intervention for HIV+ MSM Methamphetamine Users," This study tests the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention to reduce sexual risk behavior in HIV-positive methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM). It builds on the findings of a previous study (R01 DA012116 ""Promoting safer sex in HIV+ homosexual and bisexual men who use methamphetamine""). That study achieved significant short-term results that eroded over time. Accordingly this study hypothesizes that the addition of a maintenance component to the already proven counseling and educational components of the treatment model will result in longer-lasting positive effects.

HIV,Long Term Treatment Interruptions, LOTTI study Centers This a multicenter multinational study. Clinical phase: III Objectives The primary objective is to compare efficacy and safety of continuing a conventional HAART in chronically infected HIV patients with a therapeutic strategy based on long term immunologically driven treatment interruptions. Secondary objectives are:   -  To verify the risk of developing viral resistance   -  To verify the effect of the two strategies on metabolic parameters   -  To verify the possibility to steadily discontinue antiretroviral therapy in patients who started it with baseline immunological values higher than those currently recommended by international guidelines for HIV treatment   -  To identify predictive variables of the possibility to safely discontinue antiretroviral therapy   -  To verify the dynamic of CD4+ cell loss and HIV replication after treatment interruption Number of Patients: A total of 320 patients. Study design: Controlled Randomized Open study The study will last 5 years Treatment arms: Patients will be randomized in a ratio 1:1 to one of the two treatment arms Control group continuing the ongoing therapy STI group performing long term CD4 guided structured treatment interruptions In the STI arm patients will stay off therapy until their CD4 count will drop < 350 cells/mcL (one measurement will be considered sufficient). At that time point patients will resume the HAART regimen they were assuming before STI and will continue HAART until they CD4 count will raise > 600 cells/mcL (at least 2 consecutive measurements 2 months apart) and their HIV-RNA will drop below the detection limit of 50 copies/ml (one measurement will be considered sufficient). When both the CD4 count and the viral load will be within these pre-set values they will stop therapy again. There is no limit to the number of interruptions and re-start cycles during the study period End points: The primary end-point for the evaluation of the main objective of the study will be clinical. The primary outcome measure will be based on the occurrence of a clinical end-point defined as: disease progression (occurrence of any AIDS defining event) death for any cause or the occurrence of clinical events requiring hospital admission The secondary objectives of the study will be evaluated on the basis of:   -  Mean variation of blood cholesterol and triglycerides from baseline values.   -  Development of lipodystrophy or modification of a pre-existing lipodystrophy   -  Time off therapy.   -  Variation of CD4 counts and HIV-RNA levels   -  Genotypic tests to be performed in the case of HIV-RNA > 1000 copies/ml while on therapy for at least 4 months or one month after each treatment interruption. Statistics: The study is powered to evaluate equivalence between the two strategies under the assumption that in the control arm the primary end-point would be observed in a proportion of subjects < 7% and that the same proportion in the STI arm would not exceed 10% with a maximum allowed 95%CI of 12%. 320 patients will be needed for alfa = 5% and 1-beta = 80%. The primary analysis will be made according to the intention-to-treat approach and therefore no correction for eventual drop outs is needed. In addition a secondary per-protocol analysis will be performed.    ,NCT00433056
HIV,Immediate Versus Deferred Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-Associated Tuberculous Meningitis, The optimal time to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis (TBM) unknown. There are concerns that immediate ART may worsen rather than improve outcome because drug interactiond and toxicities or development of an intracerebral immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Conversely delaying ART may result in increased HIV-related deaths. To answer this question we are conducting a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial comparing immediate and deferred ART in HIV-infected patients presenting with TBM to assess effect on survival.    ,NCT00433719
HIV,Study of Pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected Women, Women represent an increasing proportion of HIV cases globally and in Canada yet are underrepresented in clinic trials. It is therefore critical to conduct this study on antiretroviral (ARV) pharmacokinetics (PK) in women to obtain additional information on ARV drug levels in women and their relation to adverse events (AEs). The hypothesis for this study is three-fold:   1. that the mean drug levels (Cmin and Cmax) of ARVs will be significantly higher in our female population as compared to the mean drug levels in the historical HIV population (which is primarily men)   2. that ARV drug levels particularly Cmin are associated with body weight in women   3. that higher ARV drug levels particularly Cmax are associated with higher frequency and severity of AEs. The objectives of this study are as follows: Primary objectives:   1. To demonstrate that levels of Protease Inhibitors (PIs) and Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) are significantly higher in our female population as compared to the mean drug levels in the historical general population (which is primarily men).   2. To determine the association between PI and NNRTI minimum concentration (Cmin) and body weight in our female population. Secondary objectives   1. To determine the association between maximum concentration (Cmax) and the frequency and severity of AEs as measured by the proportion of patients with grade 2 or higher laboratory or clinical AEs and the Symptom Index Score in women.   2. To determine the association between ARV drug levels and age race height body mass index adherence hormonal levels and therapy menstruation history duration of HIV infection duration on ARV therapy baseline viral load baseline CD4 count present CD4 count hepatitis B or C infection class of ARVs presence of ritonavir and other medications.    ,NCT00433979

The study will compare a group of HIV patients without known liver disease and a group with moderate liver disease. The anticipated time on study treatment is <3 months and the target sample size is <100 individuals.    ,NCT00435929
HIV,Randomized Controlled Trial of Stress Management Training in HIV, The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically changed the consequences of an HIV infection which is now viewed as a chronic disease. As in other chronic diseases emotional distress and depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in HIV-infected patients. Psychological factors such as these have been associated with lower quality of life lower adherence to therapy and also with a higher risk for mortality and disease progression. Psychosocial interventions such as group-based cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) training have been shown to reduce distress and psychological symptoms in HIV-infected patients. These psychosocial effects are paralleled by changes in physiological parameters such as cortisol DHEA-S testosterones catecholamines and nai?ve T-cell counts. While these results are congruent with recent evidence of the interaction between psychological neuroendocrine and immunological parameters in HIV-infected patients it needs to be shown whether the reported effects hold true in the HAART era. Most importantly it also needs to be ascertained whether these interventions have an impact on immunological and virological HIV parameters as well as on mortality and morbidity in HIV patients. We propose a randomized controlled one-year prospective evaluation of a group-based CBSM training in 80 HIV-infected patients. Participating patients will be recruited at cooperating centers of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and randomly assigned to CBSM training or waiting control group condition. At baseline post-training and two follow-up (6 and 12 months) assessments effects of the CBSM on psychological physiological and clinical out-come variables in HIV-infected patients under HAART will be evaluated. Additionally the effects of CBSM on the neuroendocrine and autonomic stress reactivity in HIV-infected patients will be assessed thus evaluating a possible direct pathway between emotional distress and physiological HIV-relevant parameters. In conclusion the planned research project evaluates the effectiveness of a standardized psychosocial intervention as a possible component of a comprehensive disease management in HIV-infected patients under HAART.    ,NCT00436085

HIV,Pioglitazone to Treat Fatty Liver in People With HIV Infection, This study will determine whether pioglitazone (Actos a drug approved to treat diabetes can benefit HIV-infected people with fatty liver. Fatty changes of the liver (also known as steatosis) have been linked to diabetes and long-term liver damage in some patients. Pioglitazone has been shown to improve fatty liver in people without HIV; this study will see if it is beneficial for people with HIV as well. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with increased fat in the liver may be eligible for this study. Screening includes a CT scan and liver biopsy (withdrawal of a small sample of liver tissue through a needle). Participants are randomly assigned to take either 45 mg of pioglitazone or placebo (sugar pill) by mouth once a day for 48 weeks. At the end of 48 weeks all participants stop taking their medication and are followed for an additional 48 weeks to see what if any benefits of pioglitazone persist after treatment is stopped. In addition to taking the study medication participants undergo the following procedures:   -  Visits to the NIH Clinical Center over a period of approximately 2 years at day 0 and weeks 2 8 16 24 32 40 48 52 72 and 96. Most visits take about 1 hour and include blood drawing for various laboratory tests.   -  Insulin clamp test at day 0 and weeks 24 and 48 to see how the body processes glucose. This test takes 4 to 6 hours and may include an overnight stay at the Clinical Center. A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the arm to infuse insulin and another is placed in a vein on the back of the hand to draw blood samples. Blood sugar is checked frequently and glucose is given to keep blood sugar at normal values.   -  Nutrition evaluations at day 0 and weeks 24 and 48. Subjects write down all the food they eat and drink for 4 days before the visit. They meet with a nutritionist to review the food record and to complete simple measurements of body fat and shape.   -  CT scan of liver and abdomen at weeks 24 48 72 and 96.   -  Liver biopsy at week 48.    ,NCT00441272

HIV,Study To Evaluate Long Term Maintenance With TRIZIVIR After Boosted Protease Inhibitor (PI) Or Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) In HIV-1 Infected Adults, The current goal of antiretroviral therapy is to use a potent regimen that will suppress plasma viral load and maintain this suppression as long as possible. However for most patients treated with such potent regimen several problems can limit their long term effectiveness and contribute to incomplete viral suppression. These problems include poor tolerability metabolic toxic effects. In order to avoid common problems as toxicity it might be interested to simplify treatment with fewer toxicity lower pill burden.

HIV,Subclinical Atherosclerosis in HIV-infected Patients, We will obtain data using multi-slice CT technology to detect subclinical coronary disease in the HIV population. Determination of subclinical cardiovascular disease using noninvasive technology and elucidation of the associated risk factors will help to guide targeted therapy to prevent cardiovascular events in this patient population. We will investigate the prevalence of coronary plaque lesions and coronary artery calcifications in men and women with HIV disease as determined by 64-row multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and MDCT coronary angiography in comparison to age-matched control subjects without HIV infection. We hypothesize that evidence of coronary artery calcification and coronary plaque lesions as seen by MDCT will be present in individuals with HIV more than non-HIV control subjects of the same age. We also hypothesize the degree of atherosclerosis will be increased in HIV patients compared to control subjects. We will evaluate the metabolic and inflammatory factors associated with coronary artery disease in HIV-infected individuals. We hypothesize that traditional cardiac risk factors as well as metabolic and inflammatory changes associated with HIV and its treatment such as dyslipidemia increased secretion of inflammatory markers decreased adiponectin increased insulin resistance and increased visceral fat may be associated with coronary artery disease in HIV-infected individuals.    ,NCT00455793

HIV,RiSolubles??the Soluble Fraction of Rice Bran for HIV-Infected Patients, HIV infection is a growing problem in Israel with over 4000 known patients who are either infected with the virus or have developed AIDS. Patients are usually followed for years until they develop an increase in their viral load (HIV-1 RNA) or their CD4 + cells decline. At this point patients are usually treated with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART). The mainstay of response to such treatment is the lowering of viral load and increase in CD4+ cells. Food supplements for HIV patients have been given in several studies with controversial results. A meta-analysis published recently [1] assessed whether micronutrient supplements are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in adults and children with HIV infection. They recommended supporting the current WHO recommendations to promote and support adequate dietary intake of micronutrients wherever possible. We expect to enroll 140 subjects in this randomized double blind placebo controlled study. Seventy subjects will be enrolled in the rice-supplement arm and 70 subjects in the control group which will receive supplemental flavored dextrose to their current medical treatment. The treatment duration is 24 weeks with follow-up at 36 weeks from enrollment. The target population is HIV-1 infected individuals who may be either on anti-retroviral therapy or not on therapy. Subjects must be with either CD4+ cells are <500 cells/mm3 or HIV plasma RNA level is > 5000 copies/ml. The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of food supplementation versus a flavored-dextrose supplement with respect to increment of patient CD4+ cell count from baseline at 24 weeks or virological response defined as lowering of plasma HIV-1 RNA and immunologic response.    ,NCT00480350

HIV,Efavirenz-based Versus Nevirapine-based Antiretroviral Therapy Among HIV-infected Patients Receiving Rifampin, The randomized controlled trial is conducted among antiretroviral naive co-infected HIV and tuberculosis patients who receiving rifampicin-based antituberculous regimen fro at least 4 weeks butt not exceed 16 weeks before enrolment. All patients receive the same backbone regimen of stavudine (30 mg/40 mg twice daily)+ lamivudie 150 mg twice daily. They are randomized to receive nevirapine 400 mg/day twice daily vs efavirenz 600 mg/day at bed time. All patients are followed through 144 weeks after initiation of antiviral therapy. The primary objective are to compare the proportion of patient who achieve undetectable plasma HIV-1RNA<50 copies/ml at week 48. The previous reports demonstrated that the standard doses of both nevirapine and efavirenz coulde be used among co-infected HIV and tuberculosis patients who receiving rifampicin even though plasma levels are somewhat reduced by rifampicin. However there have been not been a randomized control trial to compare these two regimens. Thus this trial will provide the efficacy data between these two regimens.    ,NCT00483054

HIV,An Open Label Non-Randomized Dose Escalating Trial to Assess Safety and Tolerability of Alb-Interferon Alfa 2b Every Two Weeks With Ribavirin Among HIV/HCV Coinfected Individuals, This study will determine if Albumin-linked interferon (Albinterferon alfa-2b) every 2 weeks is safe and tolerated by patients infected by both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is a new medication developed for HCV. It may help the immune system fight infections especially those caused by viruses. Albinterferon alfa-2b appears quite similar to other interferons in side effects and action in controlling HCV. Patients ages 18 and older who are infected with HCV genotype 1 are HIV positive are infected with HCV and have evidence of HCV-induced liver disease; and who are not pregnant or breast feeding may be eligible for this study. Many visits to NIH over a 76-week period are required. There will be collection of blood and urine pregnancy test and tests of HCV in the blood. A liver biopsy is required before start of the study if patients have not had one within 1 year. Another is done at the end of 72 weeks. An eye exam is done before start of the study and repeated later. An optional procedure called automated pheresis is done at the study beginning. Researchers can study patients' immunity to control HCV. Blood is drawn through a needle in an arm vein and spun in a machine to separate the desired blood component. Remaining blood is returned to the patient. Patients will receive Albinterferon alfa-2b at a dose of 900 mcg every 2 weeks for 48 weeks by injection under the skin. Ribavirin is given at 1000 mg or 1200 mg by mouth twice daily depending on a patient's weight. Side effects of Albinterferon alfa-2b are fatigue headache joint and muscle pain and sleeplessness. The major side effect of ribavirin is anemia. Visits ranging from week 3 to 44 will determine the safety of Albinterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin and to see effects on reducing the HCV viral load. For weeks 48 52 56 64 72 and 76 patients will return for a clinic visit and blood tests. At week 72 an abdominal ultrasound and liver biopsy are done.

HIV,HIV Infection and Tobacco Use Among Injection Drug Users in Baltimore Maryland: A Pilot Study of Biomarkers, Background: The incidence of lung cancer is quite high among people with the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus. Frequent smoking may explain that cancer increase given that 50% to 70% of HIV-infected people are current smokers. Recent research suggests that other factors may be involved as well. Smoking habits such as smoking earlier in life or smoking more cigarettes a day than others do may have a role. Also HIV-infected smokers seem to have a greater risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The association of HIV and COPD is important because COPD itself is linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. About 1600 subjects from the study known as ALIVE (AIDS Linked to the Intra-Venous Experience) which began in 1988 in Baltimore Maryland will be given a detailed questionnaire on smoking behaviors and lung cancer risk factors. They will also have spirometry testing to evaluate lung function. Objectives: To better characterize smoking habits and compare tobacco use among HIV-infected and uninfected drug users. To compare serum cotinine levels and spirometry results as a marker of tobacco use and a marker of damage to lung function respectively. Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age and older who are in the ALIVE cohort. Design: Patients undergo the following procedures:   -  Completing a questionnaire on smoking history. Questions include age when smoking began periods of quitting smoking average number of cigarettes per day for specific periods amount of each cigarette smoked depth of inhalation type of cigarette nicotine dependence use of other smoked [Note: I would not mention that these drugs are illegal] drugs exposure to environmental tobacco smoke past medical history and recent respiratory symptoms.   -  Spirometry testing. Patients are asked to breathe as deeply as possible and then rapidly exhale into a tube. The forced expiration volume in 1 second reflects the average flow rate during the first second and it can be used to determine the degree of pulmonary obstruction.   -  Blood samples. Tests measure levels of cotinine a chemical made by the body from nicotine. African American males who constitute the majority of the ALIVE cohort participate in this test. Results would show how much tobacco smoke has recently entered the body. For this test researchers plan to evaluate 240 current tobacco smokers and 100 participants who report no recent cigarette use.    ,NCT00491335

HIV,Early Antiretroviral Treatment and/or Early Isoniazid Prophylaxis Against Tuberculosis in HIV-infected Adults (ANRS 12136 TEMPRANO), The Temprano trial is based on the following assumptions:   -  ART initiation at CD4 counts <800/mm3 could significantly reduce the probability of severe HIV-related morbidity or death in the medium term.   -  Tuberculosis and tuberculosis-related deaths are likely to represent a considerable proportion of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients with high CD4 counts in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore 6-month Isoniazide Prophylaxis for Tuberculosis (IPT) and early ART could enhance each others efficacy.    ,NCT00495651
HIV,HIV Prevention for Youth With Severe Mental Illness," This 4-year competing continuation will extend the follow-up for 750 subjects enrolled in a randomized interventions trial Project STYLE: ""HIV Prevention for Youth with Severe Mental Illness"" (R01 MH 63008). Extending the follow-up from one year to 36 months will 1) discern the long-term impact of the Project STYLE interventions and 2) permit complex modeling of the predictors and trajectories of sexual health (delay of sex) and risk (incident STIs). Adolescents particularly those in mental health treatment are at risk for HIV because of sexual and substance behaviors. Parent-child communication about sexual topics and parental supervision are associated with delays in the onset of sexual activity and more responsible sexual behavior; thus the parent project Project STYLE is a randomized trial that is evaluating the comparative efficacy of three interventions: a) family-based HIV prevention intervention b) adolescent-only HIV prevention intervention and c) general health promotion intervention. This multi-site project (Rhode Island Hospital Emory University and the University of Illinois at Chicago) is enrolling an ethnically/racially/geographically diverse group of 750 adolescents in outpatient mental health treatment and their parents. Subjects receive a full day group intervention on the day of randomization return in two weeks for an individual session participate in a half day booster session three months later and are assessed six and 12 months after the intervention. This application offers a unique opportunity to assess this already ascertained sample at three additional points (2430 and 36 months). This is important because few studies have examined the longer-term predictors of the delay of sex and incident STIs over 36 months using a comprehensive array of family functioning family monitoring/communication and trauma history. Additionally this continuation will provide important data concerning the long-term impact of Project STYLE's theoretically based HIV prevention programs which are designed to maintain safe sexual behaviors. The Family-Based program has increased parent/adolescent sexual communication and reduced adolescent unprotected sex after six months and extended assessment will determine whether these benefits are maintained over time.

HIV,Therapeutic Schools: Affect Management and HIV Prevention, Adolescents are at risk for HIV because of sexual and drug behavior intiated during this developmental period. Those with psychological distress are less likely than their peers to benefit from frequently used skills-based interventions. It appears that emotional lability during sexual situations disrupts skills learned. This project will implement and evaluate interventions for adolescents with psychiatric disorders who are in therapeutic school settings. Affect management and skills-based interventions will be compared to a didactic standard of care condition to determine which intervention best reduces risk behavior among adolescents with psychiatric disorders in therapeutic school settings.    ,NCT00500487

HIV,Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Vaccine Trial Against HIV/AIDS, The development of a vaccine against HIV/AIDS has been primary focused on the structural proteins (Env Gag) of HIV-1 with the aim of inducing sterilizing immunity by blocking virus entry. Alternative approaches are focused on new vaccine strategies aimed at modifying the virus-host dynamic favouring the establishment of a long-term non-progressing disease status. Such strategies target regulatory proteins that are the first to be expressed after infection and are essential for viral replication infectivity and pathogenesis. Thus this approach may be effective for both preventive and therapeutic vaccination strategies.    ,NCT00505401
HIV,Empiric Therapy of Helminth Co-infection to Reduce HIV-1 Disease Progression, Abstract: Over 25 million HIV-1 infected individuals are currently living in Africa and as many as 50-90% may be co-infected with soil transmitted helminths such as roundworms hookworms or whipworms. Helminth infection in HIV-1-infected individuals may increase HIV-1 RNA levels and increase the rate of progression of HIV-1 to AIDS. Studies have also shown that successful treatment of helminth co-infection (as documented by clearance of helminth eggs in stool) led to a significant decrease in HIV-1 plasma viral load (-0.36 log10). This change in viral load was significantly greater than that seen in those individuals without documented clearance of their helminth co-infection (+0.67 log10) (p=0.04). Studies conducted in Africa have shown an estimated 2.5-fold increased risk for sexual transmission of the HIV-1 for each log increase in plasma HIV-1 viral load. In addition to direct effects on plasma viral load the rate of CD4 cell decline in helminth infected individuals may be directly impacted by the significant immune activation seen with such co-infection. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial examining the potential benefits of routine empiric helminth eradication in HIV-1 infected adults who do not yet qualify for antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in Kenya. The current standard of care of symptomatic diagnosis and treatment will be compared to a systematic empiric scheduled de-worming program for HIV infected adults. The investigators will compare markers of disease progression including rate of CD4 decline and changes in HIV-1 RNA levels between the two treatment arms.    ,NCT00507221

HIV,Integrase Inhibitor (MK-0518) Viral Decay, The eradication of HIV by antiretroviral therapy has thus far been elusive. It has been consistently demonstrated that a pool of latently infected resting CD4+ T cells persists in the majority of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy in whom plasma viremia has been successfully suppressed for prolonged periods of time; this pool has emerged as the major obstacle in achieving the eradication of HIV. We believe that MK-0518 can further the decay and suppression of HIV-1 in patients who have been virologically suppressed for a prolonged period of time on effective cART (??4 years).    ,NCT00520897
HIV,Vicriviroc in HIV-Treatment Experienced Subjects (Study P04405AM5), Vicriviroc (vye-kri-VYE-rock) is an investigational drug (not yet approved by Government Regulatory Authorities for commercial use) that belongs to a new class of drugs called CCR5 receptor blockers.

HIV,Characterization of Acute and Recent HIV-1 Infections in Zurich: a Long-term Observational Study, Aim of the study: To describe the epidemiology longitudinally follow test the effect of early antiretroviral treatment and investigate early events of virus-host interactions in patients with documented acute or recent HIV-1 infection in Zurich. Study design: This is an open label non-randomized observational single center study at the University Hospital Zurich Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology. We aim at enrolling approximately 300 patients over a 10 year period. All patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria of a documented acute or recent HIV infection can participate in the study. Patients are offered early combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) if treatment start falls within 90 days after diagnosis of acute HIV-infection. After one year of suppressed HIV-plasma viremia (< 50 copies/ml) patients can chose to stop cART. Patients who have not chosen to undergo early-cART respectively will stop cART after one year will be followed for a total of 5 years. Viral setpoints reached after treatment interruptions will be compared to historic controls and to the control group not having received cART during acute infection. A battery of virological and immunological assays will be performed on blood samples obtained to better understand early virus-host interactions which are thought to play a key role in HIV-pathogenesis research. Summary: In summary this study will provide comprehensive knowledge on early HIV-infection with regard to epidemiology impact of early-cART on the course of disease and forms the base for a variety of translational research projects addressing early key pathogenesis events between virus and host relevant for the course of disease for transmission for development of vaccines and new treatment strategies.   -  Trial with medicinal product    ,NCT00537966

HIV,Vicriviroc in HIV(R5/X4)-Treatment Experienced Subjects (Study P05057AM5)(COMPLETED), Vicriviroc (vye-kri-VYE-rock) is an investigational drug (not yet approved by Government Regulatory Authorities for commercial use) that belongs to a new class of drugs called CCR5 receptor blockers. This group of drugs blocks one of the ways HIV enters T-cells (the cells that fight infection). Previous smaller studies in HIV treatment-experienced patients have shown that vicriviroc is safe and effective. The purpose of this study is to investigate in subjects with detectable dual/mixed CCR5/CXCR4-tropic HIV whether vicriviroc when added to other appropriate HIV drugs can decrease the level of HIV (viral load) in the blood and that it is well tolerated. This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group multi-center study of vicriviroc maleate in HIV subjects infected with dual/mixed CCR5/CXCR4-tropic virus and who have documented resistance to at least 2 of the 3 antiretroviral drug classes (NRTI NNRTI or PI) or at least 6 months experience with at least 2 of the following: one NRTI one NNRTI or one PI (excluding low-dose ritonavir) and failure on their current stable regimen. The study will compare the virologic benefit of adding vicriviroc to an optimized background regimen to a control group receiving placebo plus the new optimized background therapy. The optimized background regimen will be chosen by the investigator based on results of drug susceptibility tests performed at Screening history of prior antiretroviral drug use by the patient and drug toxicity. Primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed 48 weeks of treatment. An interim analysis will be performed when all subjects have completed 24 weeks of treatment. Subjects who complete 48 weeks of treatment or who discontinue early but are deemed eligible upon rescreening will be offered participation in the open-label segment of the study and will receive vicriviroc 30 mg once daily if appropriate until commercially available or until the sponsor terminates the clinical development of vicriviroc.    ,NCT00551330

HIV,Lymphocyte Infusions for the Treatment of HIV-Infected Patients Failing Anti-HIV Therapy, Some HIV-infected individuals have a white blood cell marker known as HLA-B*57 that appears to help control the progress of the disease; however not all who have the HLA-B*57 marker are able to control the infection. This study will examine the effects of giving white blood cells with HLA-B*57 from an individual who controls HIV infection to an individual who cannot control HIV infection as a form of HIV treatment. All candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests. Both donor and recipient volunteers must be HIV-positive individuals 18 years of age or older who have the HLA-B*57 marker and are receiving care. Donor candidates must have positive HIV antibody tests for at least seven years with a recent CD4 cell count greater than 400 cells/mm? HIV viral load less than 50 copies/mL and no previous HIV viral load greater than 1000 copies/mL. Recipient candidates must have positive HIV antibody tests with a recent CD4 cell count less than 400 cells/mm? and HIV viral load greater than 10000 copies/mL and must have failed at least two prior combination antiretroviral regimes and are willing to receive or resume combination antiretroviral therapy. Donor volunteers will be excluded if they have taken certain antiretrovirals drugs have a medical history of cancer or of other blood-borne illnesses or have other medical conditions that might interfere with the study. Recipient volunteers will be excluded if they have a medical history of malignant cancer or other medical conditions that might possibly interfere with the study. Donors will undergo apheresis to separate white blood cells from circulating blood before the red blood cells and plasma are returned to the bloodstream. The procedure will take up to five hours and donors will be required to return for additional tests. Donors may be asked to return for further white blood cell donations a maximum of six procedures per year. Recipients will undergo apheresis to obtain stem cells for possible use in the study and will be admitted to an NIH Clinical Center inpatient unit to receive an infusion of white blood cells and undergo a series of blood tests both before and after the infusion. The infusion process will take two hours. After being discharged recipients will be asked to return to the Clinical Center for monitoring and follow-up tests and may receive further infusions....    ,NCT00559416

HIV,Nutrition Intervention in Drug Naive HIV-infected Kenyan Women and Their Children, Many of the 28 million people with immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) estimated to be living in sub-Saharan Africa also suffer from malnutrition. Reproductive age women their infants and young children are among the most vulnerable for malnutrition and progression of HIV to AIDS and mortality is increased in the malnourished as seen in Eastern and Southern Africa. The HIV Nutrition Project (HNP) research evaluates the effect of protein and micronutrients in meat on the health and nutritional well being of Kenyan women living with HIV in rural Kenya and the health and development of their children by means of a randomized nutrition intervention. We will determine if meat in the diets of HIV- infected women and their children (1) protects the immune system and prevents severe infection (2) prevents the loss of body mass and enhances the quality of life among drug naïve women not yet ill enough to warrant antiretroviral drugs and (3) positively impacts growth and development of vulnerable children of the HIV-infected women when compared to those given supplements with the same amount of energy but with either soya or wheat protein. The intervention food with beef protein provides significant vitamin B12 lysine and bio-available iron zinc and selenium when compared to the soya and wheat supplements. Deficiencies of these nutrients may hasten HIV disease progression. The findings from our project may have implications for the development of initiatives that are either sustainable or subsidized by the local regional and/or global economies that ensure that all HIV-infected individuals have access to adequate nutrition support that includes foods that provide enough nutrients that are needed to optimize health and well-being. The knowledge gained may significantly impact other populations at high risk for decreased immune function such as those with tuberculosis and malaria. This is a 3 arm randomized design where 225 HIV-infected rural Kenyan mothers with a CD4 between 250 and 500 WHO Stage 1 or 2 and with no co-existing infections receive with their child a nutrition biscuit supplement daily (5 days/week) for 12 months. These women are not yet ill enough to warrant treatment with antiretroviral drugs in Kenya and therefore a food intervention may keep them healthy longer and delay the need for drugs.    ,NCT00562874

HIV,CDC HIV Testing Guidelines: Unresolved Ethical Concerns, Advocacy groups have voiced concerns about the ethics of some of tenets of the CDC's new HIV testing recommendations for the healthcare setting. Three concerns are paramount: (1) the opt-out approach to HIV testing can potentially be coercive and not truly voluntary; (2) by replacing informed consent with general consent for medical care test participants might not know or be adequately informed of the benefits and consequences of testing; and (3) eliminating HIV prevention counseling from the HIV testing process presumes that test participants are aware of how to prevent an HIV infection which might not be correct. This study involves conducting interviews of HIV advocates who are raising these concerns surveying outpatient and emergency department clinical providers about their beliefs and opinions regarding the tenets of the new guidelines and then conducting a multi-center randomized controlled trial in which the ethical concerns of opt-out vs. opt-in testing are directly compared. We will conduct a multi-center randomized controlled trial whereby patients will be surveyed on their perspectives and perceptions regarding opt-out or opt-in rapid HIV testing. We will survey the participants regarding their perception of coercion their understanding of the elements contained in the informed consent process their HIV risk factors and their knowledge of HIV prevention. We will evaluate whether or not the CDC-recommended approaches regarding opt-out testing consent and decoupling of prevention counseling are supported. If there are no differences regarding these ethical concerns between testing approaches then the opt-out approach would be considered not to be inferior to the opt-in approach.    ,NCT00564369

HIV,HIV-HCV Coinfection: Impact of Immune Dysfunction, Effective therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has markedly prolonged survival in infected individuals. As a result other diseases are now becoming clinically significant. Approximately 30% of HIV infected patients are co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) which is now the leading co-morbid disease in co-infected individuals. The histologic severity and natural history of HCV has been reported to be accelerated in those co-infected with HIV. It is hypothesized that 1) the severity and progression of HCV disease is related to the immune competence of the individual 2) immune restoration associated with HIV therapy may further accelerate the progression of HCV disease which may explain the marked increase in HCV related morbidity and mortality observed in recent years and 3) the virologic response to anti-HCV treatment is directly related to the degree of immunologic competence. The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) To obtain through multi-disciplinary didactic teaching the necessary skills of clinical research design data collection data analysis and biostatistical methods and 2) To study the impact of HIV disease on HCV the effect of the immune function and immune restoration during HIV therapy on the natural history of HCV and the efficacy of HCV treatment in HIV co-infection.    ,NCT00575315
HIV,Antiretrovirals and Rate of Progression in Carotid Artery Intima-medial Thickness in HIV, It is well known that HIV-infected subjects frequently experience hyperlipidemias insulin resistance and visceral adiposity which are known to increase the risk of atherosclerosis. Several cohorts have shown an increased risk of heart disease in people with HIV. The effect of HIV treatment versus HIV itself on the incidence of heart disease is unclear. In this study the investigators will assess the effect on carotid IMT of the initiation of antiretroviral combinations that are known to have a minimal effect on lipids and insulin resistance. We will also assess the changes in several inflammation and cardiovascular markersas well as endothelial activation markersand how these changes relate to therapy-induced changes in immunologic virologic and metabolic markers.    ,NCT00575939
HIV,Understanding the Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in People With HIV, HIV is a virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) a disease for which there is not yet a cure. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven an effective treatment for inhibiting the replication of HIV allowing for improved quality of life and survival. Previous studies indicate that episodic use of ART is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

HIV,CNS (Central Nervous System) Viral Dynamics and Cellular Immunity During AIDS, Understanding whether or not viral replication occurs in the brain during chronic untreated HIV-1 infection is of undeniable importance and has implications for treatment and research priorities. Evidence suggests that viral replication in the CNS occurs at the extremes of HIV-1 disease. Brain involvement has been reported during acute infection and there is convincing evidence of CNS viral replication during HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and advanced AIDS. Some human and primate data suggest that viral RNA and proteins may be absent from brains of some individuals with chronic untreated HIV-1 infection despite abundant proviral DNA. However the extent of viral replication in the brain is not known for most of the 42 million people worldwide living with untreated HIV-1 infection. Why is viral replication in the brain such a pivotal issue? Microglial cells and macrophages are primary targets for intrathecal HIV-1 replication and this can promote neuronal injury through direct effects of gp120 and tat and indirect induction of toxic mediators. Low-grade injury over years or decades would likely be deleterious particularly as the population ages. Because treatment guidelines allow systemic HIV-1 replication to continue until CD4+ T cell counts decline considerably antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not recommended for many persons living with HIV. Demonstrating replication in the brain during chronic HIV-1 infection may affect treatment strategies and encourage investigation. Identifying factors that modulate intrathecal viral replication is equally important. Anti-HIV-1 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) partially control systemic viral replication and delay disease progression. Although available data has been provocative the role of anti-HIV CTL in the CNS has received little attention. To fill this gap we will examine relationships between intrathecal viral replication CTL responses and glial activation/proliferation during HIV-1 infection. These studies will be relevant not only to AIDS but to other inflammatory diseases of the CNS as well.    ,NCT00583167

HIV,Pharmacokinetics of the Tablet Formulation of Lopinavir/r as Standard and Increased Dosage During Pregnancy, This is a multicenter open prospective and randomized study aimed at evaluating the pharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation of lopinavir/r administered in combination with two nucleoside analogs to HIV-infected pregnant women at two different dosages:   -  Group 1 (standard dosage): 200/50 mg lopinavir/r 2 tablets every 12 hours plus two nucleoside analogs.   -  Group 2 (increased dosage): 200/50 mg lopinavir/r 2 tablets every 12 hours until the end of the second trimester of gestation (24 weeks) and 3 tablets every 12 hours in the third trimester (from 25 weeks on) plus two nucleoside analogs. Treatment will be initiated at any time between 14 and 30 weeks of gestation and will be maintained for at least 6 weeks after delivery. The objectives are:   -  To compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of the standard and increased dosage of the tablet formulation of lopinavir/r during pregnancy.   -  To determine whether the standard and/or increased dosage of the tablet formulation of lopinavir/r during pregnancy confers the same exposure to the drug as that observed in the same women after the end of pregnancy and in historic controls.   -  To evaluate the transplacental passage of lopinavir/r based on the ratio between the serum concentration in maternal blood at the time of delivery and in cord blood of the two drug dosages (standard and increased) administered during pregnancy.   -  To evaluate the tolerability of the two lopinavir/r dosages (standard and increased) during pregnancy.   -  To describe the vertical transmission rate of HIV to the children of the pregnant women included in the study.    ,NCT00605098
HIV,Clinical Trial to Assess the Security of the Dose Reduction of Ritonavir in HIV-Infected Patients in Treatment With Tipranavir/Ritonavir 500/200 mg Every 12 Hours, Tipranavir is a drug with a high antiretroviral activity also in presence of major mutations in the protease gene. However its necessity of being co-administered with 400 mg of ritonavir daily limits its efficacy for the treatment of HIV-infected patients due to the high incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events. Nevertheless tipranavir plasma though concentrations were higher than the proposed minimum effective concentration for patients with previous experience with protease inhibitors (PI) in half of patients treated with tipranavir/ritonavir at 500/100 mg dose every 12 hours. Furthermore when the number of mutations in the protease gene is limited there are no differences in the reduction of the viral load between patients treated with tipranavir/ritonavir at 500/200 mg and 500/100 mg every 12 hours. At last the efficacy of tipranavir treatment has been more closely related with the inhibition quotient (IQ) than with concentrations considered isolated. Considering the previous arguments it can be hypothesized that basing in every subject IQ it could be possible to identify those patients HIV-infected in treatment with tipranavir/ritonavir at 500/200 mg every 12 hours that could take advance of the reduction of ritonavir to 100 mg every 12 hours without compromising the viral replication control. This strategy could improve the tolerability to the treatment what could result in a better adherence and less proportion of treatment abandon due to this reason    ,NCT00607958
HIV,Determining the Effects of Observed and Self-Administered Drug Regimens in HIV Infected Adults, Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to better health and survival rates among people with HIV/AIDS. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of trained partner supervision when taking medication versus self-administered therapy in HIV infected participants.

HIV,Evaluate the Efficacy and Security of Darunavir/Ritonavir 900/100 mg Once a Day as an Antiretroviral Treatment Simplification Strategy, Basing in studies which have related the darunavir (DRV) virtual inhibitory quotient (vIQ) with the virological response it is possible to think in the possibility of simplifying the rescue treatment with DRV/ritonavir to 900/100 mg once a day in those patients who are being treated with DRV/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice a day and who besides having undetectable viral load have a vIQ over 2. This strategy would not jeopardize the efficacy of the antiretroviral treatment and would have less impact in the lipid profile of the patients as well as less pharmaceutical expenditure.    ,NCT00611039
HIV,Efficacy and Safety to Extend Treatment 24 Weeks in co-Infected HIV-HCV Genotype 1 and/or 4, A study concerning viral kinetic with 10 co-infected HIV-HCV patients on treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a + ribavirin o IFN + ribavirin was reported in Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections 2002 by Dr. Torriani shown half-life of HCV virions and the viral clearance was larger than mono-infected patients. The doubt is if this difference in viral kinetic of HIV-HCV co-infected patients versus mono-infected is related with the loss of profited on treatment. In the APRICOT trial patients genotype 2/3 were treated for 48 weeks and the relapse rates was only 2%. The present study want to evaluate is the treatment extent for 24 weeks more in patients genotype 1 and/or 4 will be improve the percentage of patients with viral clearance at the end of the follow-up period to prevent relapsed in patients with response at the end of treatment. Patients will be randomized to received 180 µg/week of peginterferon alfa-2a + 1000-1200 mg/day of ribavirin during 24 weeks more or control.    ,NCT00612755

HIV,Nevirapine Drug Levels in HIV Positive Patients Also Receiving Rifampicin for Tuberculosis, Triomune is the most commonly prescribed treatment for HIV infection in Uganda. Triomune is manufactured by a generic drug company and consists of three drugs combined in a single pill given twice daily (stavudine 30mg plus lamivudine 150mg plus nevirapine 200mg). It is known that the levels of nevirapine in a patient's blood are highest in the first two weeks of treatment. Therefore it is recommended that patients starting on nevirapine should undergo dose escalation i.e start on 200mg once daily for two weeks and then increase to full dose of 200mg twice daily in order to avoid nevirapine related rash. It is not possible to do dose escalation with a fixed dose combination pill like Triomune and for the two weeks of the dose escalation patients either can buy stavudine plus lamivudine plus nevirapine as separate pills or take Triomune in the morning and then take stavudine plus lamivudine as separate pills in the evening. Rifampicin is used to treat TB and lowers the levels of nevirapine in a patient's blood. This raises two questions in routine clinical practice for patients who are co-infected with HIV and TB (1) Do we need to put our patients to the trouble of dose escalation of nevirapine if they are already on rifampicin? and (2) If we dose escalate nevirapine in patients on rifampicin are we putting them at risk of low drug levels and development of resistance? The aim of this study is to compare the plasma concentrations of nevirapine in HIV infected patients who are commencing antiretroviral therapy with and without a lead in dose of nevirapine and who are also receiving concomitant treatment with antituberculous therapy which includes rifampicin to assess whether dose escalation of nevirapine is appropriate in this patient population    ,NCT00617643

HIV,Drug Interaction Study Between Lumefantrine and Lopinavir/Ritonavir, With the roll out of antiretroviral therapy (ARV) for HIV across sub-Saharan Africa an unprecedented number of people will be commencing lifelong therapy. Current estimates are that 5-6 million people in sub-Saharan Africa require ART. At the same time the World Health Organization (WHO) Roll Back Malaria campaign is aggressively promoting the use of artemether/lumefantrine as first-line therapy for malaria in this setting. Many patients in this setting have already become resistant to first-line ARV and have moved onto lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) based second-line regimens. Kaletra is a potent inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of many drugs which is found predominantly in the liver and the gut. Lumefantrine and to a lesser extent artemether is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A4. Therefore when given to a patient already taking Kaletra for HIV it is likely that elevated levels of these drugs in the patient will result. There is some concern that lumefantrine may be cardiotoxic due to its structural similarity to halofantrine which is known to cause irregular heart rhythms. This has not been borne out as yet in any studies performed with lumefantrine however it is not known what levels will be achieved in patients when it is administered with a protease inhibitor such as Kaletra. The WHO has not addressed this issue in any of its previous policy documents but has identified ARV-antimalarial drug interaction studies as a research priority. This single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study aims to compare the levels of lumefantrine/artemether that result when it is given to a patient on Kaletra with patients not on any ARV. Data generated by this study will help address this important knowledge gap which has been identified by WHO and others as meriting urgent investigation.    ,NCT00619944
HIV,Drug Interaction Between Coartem® and Nevirapine Efavirenz or Rifampicin in HIV Positive Ugandan Patients, There are increasing numbers of HIV-infected patients in sub-Saharan Africa receiving antiretroviral drugs and/or rifampicin based antituberculous therapy. HIV infected patients are at an increased risk of contracting malaria. Increasing resistance to anti-malarials such as chloroquine amodiaquine fansidar sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in East and West Africa has led the WHO to recommend artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem®- Novartis) as first line therapy for malaria for adults and children. As early as 2004 fourteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa had adopted this guideline as national policy. There are no data on the interaction between Coartem® and any of the antiretroviral agents. Both components of Coartem® are substrates for the 3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450. Despite the lack of data antiretroviral drugs and/or antituberculous drugs in addition to Coartem® are of necessity co-prescribed daily in the African setting. Nevirapine efavirenz and rifampicin are known inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4. A technical consultation convened by WHO in June 2004 concluded that additional research on interactions between antiretroviral and antimalarial drugs is urgently needed. We propose to perform a suite of pharmacokinetic studies to evaluate these interactions in HIV infected Ugandan patients. The aim of these studies is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction between Coartem® and commonly co-prescribed inducers of 3A4 i.e. nevirapine efavirenz and rifampicin.   1. Comparison of steady state pharmacokinetics of Coartem® in HIV-infected patients prior to commencement of nevirapine and at nevirapine steady state   2.

HIV,Evaluate Tolerability of a Multi-envelope Prime-boost HIV Vaccine in Healthy Adults, Vaccines have been very successful in preventing viral infections such as hepatitis B and the measles. Viral vaccines work by causing a person's immune system to make cells that will work against the virus. Due to the success in treating other viral infections scientists are trying to develop a vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV infection is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is one of the most serious viral infections we know. This is a research study to evaluate the safety of a possible vaccine against HIV. Researchers want to determine that a person's immune system can respond to the HIV before he or she is exposed to it. Therefore that person may be able to be protected from infection with HIV.    ,NCT00623753

HIV,Genetic Predictors of Variability in the Drug-drug Interaction Between Darunavir/Ritonavir and Pravastatin, Pravastatin (Pravachol) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is used to treat high cholesterol. Darunavir (Prezista) and ritonavir (Norvir) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat HIV infection. When darunavir and ritonavir are given with pravastatin they can increase the blood levels of pravastatin. The degree of this interaction varies from person to person. The way that darunavir and ritonavir interact with pravastatin may be affected by a person's genetic make-up. Genetic factors (or DNA) are those that people are born with and that make each person unique. Genetic differences are the reason why one person's body traits such as height and hair color are different from another person's body traits. Genetic differences can also affect the way a medication works in the body or the way two medications interact in the body. The purpose of this clinical study is to determine if a person's genetic make-up affects the way darunavir and ritonavir interact with pravastatin in the body.    ,NCT00630734

HIV,HIV-HBV Co-Infection and Liver Disease, Human immunodeficiency virus/Hepatitis B virus (HIV/HBV) co-infections are frequently observed due to shared routes of transmission with reported figures indicating 6-9% of HIV-infected individuals in developed countries are chronically infected with HBV. HIV infection impacts on the natural progression of HBV infection increasing levels of HBV replication and the risk of liver-associated mortality. Liver diseases associated with HBV are affected by the antiviral drugs used for HIV infection (toxic side effects) the current immune function in the patient by improvements in the immune system brought about by control of the HIV infection and by the development of resistance to the antiviral agents used for both the hepatitis B and the HIV infection. Co-infection with HBV increases the risk for hepatotoxicity in those individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for their HIV infection. This study will recruit patients who are co-infected with HIV and HBV and are currently taking or who are about to commence HAART. The study cohort will include HIV-HBV co-infected individuals from the Alfred Hospital the Royal Melbourne Hospital and high case load GP clinics who are referred to the Alfred Hospital. The aim of the study is to investigate chronic hepatitis B and its impact on the progression of liver disease in HIV-infected persons receiving HAART. This will be achieved by 6 monthly assessment with medical history physical examination bloods for markers of liver disease and hepatitis B activity and completion of questionnaires to measure adherence and alcohol use.    ,NCT00637429

These improvements should translate into reduced cardiovascular disease risk in HIV-infected people.    ,NCT00639457
HIV,Nevirapine Study for the Prevention of Maternal-Infant HIV Transmission in Uganda, The increase in pediatric HIV infection has a substantial impact on childhood mortality in the developing world. A number of recent studies suggest that as many as half or more of mother-to-child HIV transmissions in developing countries occur in late pregnancy or during labor and delivery. Interventions targeted during the perinatal period have shown to be effective and to have a significant impact in reducing transmission. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of nevirapine (NVP) plus immunoprophylaxis or extended NVP dosing regimens in HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants during the perinatal period.    ,NCT00639938
HIV,Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Infant Peri-exposure Prophylaxis With Lopinavir/Ritonavir Versus Lamivudine to Prevent HIV-1 Transmission by Breastfeeding, The ANRS 12174 study is a clinical trial that will compare the efficacy and safety of prolonged infant peri-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) versus Lamivudine to prevent HIV-1 transmission through breast milk in children born to HIV-1-infected mothers not eligible for HAART and having benefited from perinatal antiretroviral (ART) regimens. The study will recruit 1500 mother-infant pairs in 4 African countries. Study design: PROMISE PEP is a multinational randomised double-blind controlled clinical trial. Intervention: Infants will be randomised to receive LPV/r or 3TC twice daily from day seven (± 2 days) after birth until 4 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding (BF). We will recommend exclusive BF (EBF) up till including the 26th week of life followed by a relatively rapid (maximum of 8 weeks) cessation period. The maximum duration of PEP will thereby be 38 weeks. Primary objective: To compare the efficacy of infant LPV/r (40/10mg twice daily if 2-4kg and 80/20mg twice daily if >4kg) vs. Lamivudine 75mg twice daily if 2-4kg 25mg twice daily if 4-8kg and 50mg twice daily if >8kg) from day 7 until 4 weeks after cessation of BF (maximum duration of prophylaxis: 50 weeks for a maximum duration of breastfeeding of 46 weeks) to prevent postnatal HIV-1 acquisition between 7 days and 50 weeks of age. Secondary objectives:   -  To assess the safety of long-term infant prophylaxis with LPV/r versus Lamivudine (including resistance adverse events and growth) until 50 weeks.   -  HIV-1-free survival until 50 weeks   -  To build clinical trials capacity at the four study sites. Main endpoint: Acquisition of HIV-1 (as assessed by HIV-1 DNA PCR) between day 7 and 50 weeks of age Study population: HIV-uninfected infants at day 7 (± 2 days) born to HIV-1 infected mothers not eligible for HAART who choose to breastfeed their infants and who have benefited from the national prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) program during pregnancy and delivery. The study will recruit 1500 mother-infant pairs in Burkina Faso South Africa Uganda and Zambia. Study duration: Infants will be followed up for 50 weeks and the total study duration is five years. Expected outcome: This study will inform on the relative advantages (efficacy) and drawbacks of two interventions to support HIV-1-infected women not eligible for HAART to safely breastfeed their babies. If found to be safe and efficacious the regimens would avoid the existing contradiction between optimal infant feeding and the prevention of MTCT through breast milk. Clinical trial capacity development will improve the future quality of trials conducted in these countries.    ,NCT00640263

HIV,Raltegravir Therapy for Women With HIV and Fat Accumulation, Ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimens have become a backbone for treatment of people with HIV. However adverse drug effects particularly lipodystrophy/lipoatrophy are closely associated with these regimens. Therefore there is a need for a drug with comparable effectiveness to the ritonavir boosted PIs without the side effects of dyslipidemia which has been associated with elevated cholesterol and cardiovascular disease Raltegravir is an HIV integrase inhibitor in phase III clinical development. To date there are no approved drugs that target the same stage of the HIV-1 lifecycle. However data from studies indicate that raltegravir is generally safe and well tolerated and has strong antiretroviral activity when used in combination with licensed antiretroviral medications. This study aims to demonstrate that patients substituting raltegravir for a PI or NNRTI based antiretroviral regimen will be associated with a 10% reduction in body fat over 24 weeks. The study will consist of a total of 10 subject visits over a period of 48 weeks. Approximately 40 female patients will participate in this study (approximately 10 at UCLA).    ,NCT00656175

HIV,Raltegravir Augmentation on Persistent Central Nervous System (CNS) Immunoactivation in Treated HIV-1 Patients, This pilot study focuses on the persistence of central nervous system (CNS) immune activation that has been observed in the presence of 'effective' combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Attention to this issue is based on the fear that chronic CNS immunoactivation can cause indolent brain injury that will eventually compromise brain function as patients survive for years on treatment. A leading hypothesis explaining this continued immunoactivation is that viral replication continues within the brain at a level too low for detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) yet sufficient to stimulate local immunoactivation. Based on this hypothesis we propose to use augmented treatment with raltegravir to test whether additional suppression of this hypothesized CNS HIV-1 replication will reduce continued CNS immunoactivation.    ,NCT00672932
HIV,Cotrimoxazole Prophylaxis Cessation Study Among Stabilized HIV-Infected Adult Patients on HAART in Entebbe Uganda, According to the national guidelines in Uganda and to the World Health Organization guidelines HIV-infected patients should receive cotrimoxazole prophylaxis indefinitely. There are however concerns regarding the indefinite application of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis among patients immunologically stabilized on HAART (e.g. high pill burden drug-drug interactions toxicity and poor adherence because of treatment fatigue). To date no empirical evidence is available regarding the safety and optimal timing for the cessation of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis among HAART patients who successfully restored immunological competence. Research question: Does morbidity significantly differ between continuation (orthodox) and cessation (experimental) of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis among immuno-competent patients stable HAART in the resource-limited setting of Uganda?    ,NCT00674921
HIV,Impact of Peer Health Workers and Mobile Phones on HIV Care, The provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in rural resource-limited settings entails substantial challenges due to limitations in the health service infrastructure and in human resources for HIV/AIDS care. In addition long geographical distances between providers care facilities and patients can represent a significant barrier to appropriate and timely care. The use of peer health workers as frontline adherence supporters and clinical monitors in order to improve care in underserviced settings has been implemented by a number of programs but the effect of peer support on HIV care outcomes has not been extensively evaluated. Mobile phones have also been proposed as a potential method of improving access to health care in resource-limited environments by expediting communication and data transfer but rigorous studies on their effectiveness in Africa have not yet been conducted. The Rakai Health Science Project (RHSP) was founded in 1987 to study the HIV epidemic in the rural setting of Rakai District in southwest Uganda. Since June 2004 the US President's Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has enabled the RHSP to provide ART through a community-based distribution system which includes clinical monitoring via a decentralized mobile clinic approach. By late 2006 the program has screened 4397 HIV-infected individuals and initiated ART in 849 patients. One of the challenges of providing ART in this setting has been the distance between many patients' homes and the clinic and medical staff trained in HIV care. This distance and the lack of communication channels make frequent clinic contacts difficult and has raised concerns about adherence and management of drug toxicity. This study will investigate whether peer health workers can help support this AIDS care program and improve patient outcomes. This study is a three armed community-randomized operations research trial to assess the effectiveness of peer health workers with and without mobile phones in improving the delivery of HIV care in the resource-limited Rakai setting. The three arms will be: a) communities with peer health workers b) communities with peer health workers and mobile phones and c) control communities without peer health workers. Study hypotheses include:   -  Peer health workers by supporting adherence and by managing simple clinical issues will reduce virologic treatment failure and improve ARV adherence compared to patients in communities without peer educators.   -  Mobile phone technology used by peer health workers by more rapidly addressing adherence and clinical problems will reduce treatment failure and improve adherence compared to patients in communities with peer health workers without mobile phones.    ,NCT00675389
HIV,Enhancing Communication and HIV Outcomes, The goal of this research is to improve communication between the patients with HIV and their health care providers. The overall purpose of doing so is to reduce disparities in medication self-efficacy adherence to therapy and HIV viral load suppression. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a combined provider and patient communication intervention conducted at two separate visits compared to usual care in improving the quality of patient-provider communication patients' medication self-efficacy patient adherence to therapy and HIV RNA suppression.    ,NCT00675610
HIV,Aging & HIV/AIDS Neurocognitive Sequelae and Functional Consequences, While the numbers of HIV infected veterans under the age of 50 are declining the percentage of HIV infected veterans over the age of 50 is increasing with the largest percentage increases in the 50-59 age group and the 70+ age group. With increasing incidence rates of new cases among individuals over 50 years of age and the longer life expectancies of the current HIV-infected population it becomes increasingly important to better understand the impact of the aging process on the clinical and behavioral manifestations of HIV/AIDS. The project seeks to determine the effect of age on neuropsychological performance in HIV+ persons. This objective seeks to determine the degree to which older age represents an independent risk factor for neuropsychological impairment in HIV infected persons with a particular emphasis on those cognitive processes that are preferentially impacted by both the normal aging process as well as HIV infection. Additionally another aim of the study is to determine the impact of neuropsychological decline on everyday functional abilities among older vs. younger HIV+ adults. This objective seeks to determine the effects of advancing age and neuropsychological impairment on the ability of HIV+ persons to discharge more demanding requirements of independent living (e.g. driving financial management medication adherence). The project will last for a duration of 5 years.    ,NCT00675766

HIV,Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir During Third Trimester Pregnancy and Post-Partum, This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic disposition of raltegravir in pregnant HIV-1 infected women. These results will be compared to pharmacokinetic data obtained following pregnancy as well as to studies previously carried out in nonpregnant women and male patients. By determining the disposition characteristics for this specific patient population antiretroviral (ARV) dosing can be optimized during pregnancy. Appropriate dosing is necessary to minimize adverse effects slow progression of disease and further reduce the risk for vertical transmission. Data will also be obtained on genital tract penetration and placenta transfer of raltegravir to the newborn. The subjects enrolled in this study will take an antiretroviral based regimen containing raltegravir twice daily both during and after their pregnancy. The specific regimen will be chosen by their own primary care provider based on their antiretroviral history and resistance testing. They will undergo a series of blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis over 12 hours on two occasions; a) during their 3rd trimester and b) approximately 3 months postpartum. Concentrations of raltegravir in the infant will be assessed by cord and infant blood sample at delivery and a blood sample at approximately 3 months of age. Hypothesis: The pharmacokinetic exposure of raltegravir as measured by the 12 hour area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-12h) during third trimester pregnancy is similar to the AUC0-12h estimated three months post-partum.    ,NCT00689910

The results will tell us if patients that receive PV after 6 months of ART have better response to the vaccine than those that get vaccinated prior to treatment.    ,NCT00706550
HIV,Directly Administered Antiretroviral Therapy (DAART) Among HIV-1infected Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) in Chennai India, Though the HIV epidemic in India is predominantly among heterosexual populations it is estimated that there are approximately 1.1 million injection drug users (IDUs) in India with HIV prevalence as high as 64% among IDUs in certain cities. In April 2004 the government of India launched a free-antiretroviral therapy roll-out program aimed at initiating 100000 persons on HAART. Similar guidelines are currently being followed for the delivery and choice of HAART for IDU and non-IDU populations. However IDUs have certain issues that complicate the delivery of HAART that need to be addressed by delivery programs such as delayed access to care poor perceived adherence and more rapid disease progression. This proposal will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of directly administered antiretroviral therapy (DAART) in conjunction with opioid substitution as a mode of delivery of HAART to IDUs in Chennai India. To evaluate this objective we will conduct a randomized controlled pilot study of DAART vs self-administered therapy (SAT) among 100 HIV-1 infected treatment naïve IDUs who are enrolled in an opioid substitution program in Chennai and compare the following outcomes between the two arms: Primary Endpoint: Proportion of participants with viral load (VL) <400 copies/ml at 24 and 48 weeks; Secondary Endpoints: (1) Incidence of mortality and AIDS-defining illnesses at 24 and 48 weeks (2) Changes in absolute CD4+ count from baseline at 24 and 48 weeks and (3) Incidence of antiretroviral drug resistance at 24 and 48 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses will be used. The study objective is in line with the priority areas identified in the Indian National AIDS Control Program Phase III (NACP III) and the results of this study will help inform the government of India on appropriate modes of delivery of HAART to IDUs. This study will also be among the first studies to be conducted in India to evaluate two different modes of delivery of HAART to IDUs.    ,NCT00709007
HIV,Adding Maraviroc to Antiretroviral Therapy for Suboptimal CD4 T-Cell Recovery Despite Sustained Virologic Suppression, Despite viral suppression antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not restore CD4+ T-cell counts in some subjects.

HIV,Phase I Study of HIV Adenoviral Vector Vaccine in Healthy Subjects Using Needle or Biojector Injection, This study will compare the immune response and side effects of an experimental HIV vaccine given by two different methods of administration by needle injection or by use of a needle-free device called the Biojector 2000 (Registered Trademark). The vaccine called VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP or rAd5 is made using an adenovirus that has been modified to contain DNA that codes for three HIV proteins. It cannot cause HIV or adenoviral infections. Healthy volunteers who are not infected with the HIV virus may be eligible for this study. Subjects are recruited for two study groups: Group 1 comprises volunteers who are 18 to 50 years old and have never received an HIV vaccine and Group 2 comprises volunteers who are 18 to 55 years old and participated in a prior study in which they received at least one injection of the study rAd5 vaccine. Subjects in both groups are randomly assigned to receive the vaccine by needle or Biojector 2000 (Registered Trademark) into a muscle in the upper arm. They call a study nurse 2 days after the injection record their temperature and symptoms on a diary card at home for 5 days after the injection for later review and visit the clinic two weeks after the injection for a checkup. The injection is given on the day of enrollment. Additional visits are scheduled at weeks 2 4 12 and 24 when subjects are checked for health changes or problems their use of medications and how they are feeling. Blood samples are collected at all clinic visits. Subjects are tested for HIV at the beginning and end of the study are asked about their sexual behavior and drug use and are counseled about HIV risk reduction. Women are tested for pregnancy at the beginning and end of the study. Participants in Group 2 may undergo apheresis at the 4-week visit. This procedure is done to collect white blood cells for tests to examine the immune response to the vaccine. Blood is collected through a needle in the vein of one arm and directed through a machine that separates the cell components. The white cells are removed and the rest of the blood is returned through the same needle. Subjects are asked about any social effects they may have experienced from participating in the study. These effects are monitored to make sure participants receive any needed assistance and to learn ways to prevent these problems in the future.    ,NCT00709605

HIV,Assessment of Cytokine Values in Serum and by RT-PCR in HIV-1 Individuals With and Without HAART, A cross-sectional study was performed on HIV-1 infected individuals with or without antiretroviral treatment. 73 HIV-1 infected individuals were divided into three groups: G1= 15 infected individuals with or without AIDS who never received ARV; G2= 27 patients on HAART and plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) equal or greater than 50 copies/mL and G3= 31 patients on HAART with undetectable VL for at least the past 6 months and a fourth group G4= 20 individuals chosen between blood donors without any disease sign and with negative HIV serum tests (control group). Serum cytokine levels pg/mL (ELISA) and specific mRNA expression by RT-PCR were performed on all four groups for TNF-a IL-2 INF-g IL-4 and IL-10. All patients were submitted to VL determination and CD4+ and CD8+T lymphocyte counts. Results analysis showed a significant comparison between groups for both methods and association between them (>80% - r2>0.80) with only one exception in the individuals of control group for IL-2 by ELISA determination. The cytokine profile for both methods and three patient groups was mature Th-0. The behavior of IL-2 and INF-g must be emphasized with the consequent expression on dominant Th profile. Both methods showed low IL-2 and elevated mean INF-g values in the three patient groups.    ,NCT00746473
HIV,An Affect Management Intervention for Juvenile Offenders, Adolescents are at risk for HIV because of sexual and drug behavior initiated during this developmental period. Adolescents in the juvenile justice system are at increased risk for HIV due to higher rates of substance use and psychopathology than their non-offending peers. Juvenile justice youth may therefore also be less likely to benefit from frequently used skills based interventions. It appears that emotional lability frequently found in this population disrupts skills learned. This project will implement and evaluate an affect management HIV prevention intervention for adolescents in a juvenile drug court program. Affect management and general health promotion interventions will be compared to determine which intervention best reduces risk behavior among adolescents in the drug court.    ,NCT00748800

HIV,Effect of an Online Video-Based Intervention to Increase HIV Testing in Men Who Have Sex With Men in Peru, Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for the greatest burden of the HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) epidemic in Peru. Current interventions that promote early identification and treatment of these diseases target a limited number of this population because they rely solely on peer education. To assess the use of the Internet as an alternative tool to reach this population the investigators propose to conduct an online randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of HIV-testing motivational videos versus standard public health text both offered through gay websites. The methodology the investigators will use is divided in: (1) the development period where the investigators will select gay websites for banner advertisement create and refine effective recruitment messages and design the online survey and the video-based intervention (2) the intervention period where participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized into a video or a standard public health text. The videos will be customized for three audiences based on self-identification: gay non-gay and trans and will be framed within the health-belief model and the stages of change theory (3) in the outcome evaluation period we will compare the 'intentions to get tested' and 'time to HIV testing at the clinic' among MSM of each of the trial arms. If the Internet is an effective venue to reach MSM for HIV testing Peruvian health programs that target this population may start considering the delivery of web-based interventions and other online prevention services to this under served and hard-to-reach population.    ,NCT00751192

HIV,Raltegravir + Lopinavir/Ritonavir Versus Efavirenz + Tenofovir + Emtricitabine in Treatment Naive Patients, CCTG 589 is a randomized open-label pilot study comparing the efficacy safety and tolerability of RAL plus LPV/r to EFV plus TDF/FTC in HIV-infected treatment-naïve subjects. Subjects will be ineligible if they have any evidence of drug resistant virus in the past or at the time of screening (if never previously tested). Those who are found to be eligible will be randomized 1:1 to initiate either LPV/r (400/100 mg) plus RAL (400mg) both given twice-daily or fixed dose combination of EFV (600 mg) TDF (300 mg) and FTC (200 mg) given as once-daily Atripla® for 48 weeks. Hypotheses   1. The novel nucleoside-sparing combination of LPV/r + RAL will have a faster phase 1 viral decay rate compared to standard-of-care therapy with EFV/TDF/FTC in antiretroviral-naïve patients.   1. Faster phase 1 viral decay dynamics will be associated with improved longer-term (week 48) viral suppression.   2. Faster phase 1 viral decay dynamics will be associated with accelerated early (Day 0-14) clearance of cell-associated HIV DNA.   3. Faster phase 1 viral decay dynamics will be associated with greater early (baseline to week 12) CD4+ T-cell recovery.   2. The LPV/r + RAL arm will have greater decreases in early (baseline to week 4) CD4/CD8 T-cell immune activation and apoptosis which will be associated with greater late (week 12 to week 48) CD4+ T-cell recovery.   3. Subjects treated with LPV/r + RAL arm will have smaller changes in total cholesterol and triglycerides from baseline than those receiving EFV/TDF/FTC.    ,NCT00752856

HIV,Comparison of Liquid Kaletra and Low Dose Kaletra Tablets, Kaletra (a combination drug with lopinavir and ritonavir) is one of a few effective medications that are approved and available for young children who are HIV+. The liquid form is reported to have a very nasty taste and presents difficulties for the children who must take the medication twice a day and for their parents who must enforce the medication regimen. The children are often well into their teens before they weigh enough to be able to take the adult dose tablet (200mg/50mg). A new smaller dose tablet (100mg/25mg) is now available. However it is not known if the liquid and tablet act the same in children. The purpose of this study is to switch children from the baseline treatment with the liquid to the study intervention treatment with 100mg/25mg tablet form of Kaletra. The study will compare children pre-switch and post-switch in terms of how well their HIV is controlled . Comparisons of parent and child satisfaction will also be made. Eight to 10 HIV+ children currently well managed with a medications including liquid Kaletra will be invited to switch from the liquid to the low dose Kaletra tablet. The parent and/or child will complete a satisfaction survey for the liquid Kaletra and lab values will be taken from the chart. At the time of the switch and 1 3 and 6 months post switch blood tests will be drawn and the parent and/or child will complete the satisfaction survey. In addition at the switch and 1 month post switch a day will be spent in clinic with 5 blood draws to see how much of the drug is in the blood stream at different times after the medicine is taken.    ,NCT00762320

HIV,Immune Responses in Patients Treated With Raltegravir, Hypothesis: Treatment with raltegravir does not alter V(D)J recombination or immune responses to neoantigens. A process known as V(D)J recombination is essential for developing lymphocytes and the specific functioning of the immune system. Raltegravir is the first approved drug of the new integrase inhibitor class of anti-HIV drugs. Integrase inhibitors have been shown in some studies to interfere with DNA cleavage and the activities of RAG-1/2. These studies suggest a potential to affect aspects of both B-cell and T-cell development therefore it is important to evaluate the potential effects that integrase inhibitors may have in clinical use. If immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes are altered by HIV integrase then patient lymphocytes will fail to display normal responses to vaccinations.    ,NCT00785967

HIV,Can Presumptive Anthelminthic Treatment Delay the Progression of HIV in ART-naïve Patients in Rural Africa?, This study focuses on one of the major health issues of Sub-Saharan Africa: multi-parasitism and co-infections. In particular this study aims to elucidate the interaction of helminths with HIV. There is good reason to suspect a detrimental effect of helminth infection on the course of HIV infection. We hypothesize that treatment of helminths in HIV- and helminth co-infected individuals leads to a reduction of HIV viral load. With a lower HIV RNA level one would expect a slower decline of CD4 cells and hence also a slower progression of the disease. Ideally this would lead to a prolongation of the chronic phase of HIV infection and to a delay in the time when anti-retroviral treatment needs to be started.    ,NCT00817713

HIV,Chloroquine for Reducing Immune Activation in HIV- Infected Individuals," HIV is characterized by frequent immune system activation. Early in the course of infection the body establishes an immune activation ""set point"" related to the amount of HIV in the blood stream. This set point affects the rate of CD4 cell loss. Without CD4 cells or with very low levels of CD4 cells the body cannot fight off illness. This is known as immunodeficiency. If left untreated HIV can lead to extreme immunodeficiency and AIDS. Evidence suggests that by decreasing the rate of immune system activation immune deficiency progression could be prevented. The purpose of this study is to learn how well chloroquine can reduce the level of immune activation and to test the safety and tolerance of chloroquine in people infected with HIV.    ",NCT00819390

HIV,Vaccination With Autologous Dendritic Cells Pulsed With HIV-Antigens for Treatment of Patients With Chronic HIV-Infection, Phase I test of concept study: In an attempt to induce new immunity to HIV-1 during untreated HIV-1 infection the investigators have identified relatively immune silent immune subdominant HLA-A2-restricted HIV-1 CTL epitopes that fit individuals with the HLA-A2 tissue type (about 50% of peoples in Denmark). Immunising with these conserved epitopes could induce new immunity and lower viral load so the patient will live longer before AIDS or Antiviral medicine and a lower viral load will limit spread in the population. As adjuvants the investigators used patients' own autologous Dendritic Cells generated from blood cells in vitro. 12 healthy male HIV-1 infected not in therapy individuals were used for this therapeutic vaccination and tested for safety and induction of new cellular CD8 and CD4 T-cell immunity.    ,NCT00856154

HIV,Combination Pain Therapy in HIV Neuropathy, Neuropathy results from damage to the nerves in the feet and legs. It is usually experienced as pain tingling or numbness. In HIV-infected people neuropathy can result from the infection itself or be a side effect of antiretroviral treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine whether two different drugs methadone and duloxetine reduce neuropathy-associated pain in HIV-infected people. This study will also examine whether utilization of both of these drugs is more effective than treatment with only one.    ,NCT00863057

HIV,Observational Study of Specificity of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Screening and Diagnostics in HIV-Infected Individuals, An estimated 3 million HIV-infected individuals will enter programs for antiretroviral (ARV) treatment in the coming year with projected rates of requirement for ARV therapy extending to more than 10 million in sub-Saharan Africa southeastern Asia and Latin America in the coming decade. In these settings Tuberculosis (TB) is an endemic infection in the population and an estimated 30-60% of adults have been infected with TB the leading opportunistic infection associated with HIV infection. The purpose of this study is to construct a standardized diagnostic evaluation (SDE) for TB that provides an increase in identification of participants with active pulmonary TB without sacrificing specificity.    ,NCT00865826
HIV,Pneumocystis in Pathogenesis of HIV-associated Emphysema, A. Statement of Hypotheses: HIV-infected patients have an increased incidence of emphysema compared to non-HIV-infected smokers and it has been hypothesized that this accelerated disease progression is the result of one or more latent infections that amplifies the pulmonary inflammatory response to cigarette smoke. Pneumocystis is one infectious agent that likely plays a key role in the development of HIV-associated emphysema. Colonization with Pneumocystis has been demonstrated in HIV-infected subjects and HIV-infected smokers are particularly susceptible to Pc colonization regardless of CD4 cell count or use of prophylaxis. Pneumocystis colonization is also increased in non-HIV-infected patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is directly related to the severity of the disease. The presence of Pneumocystis in the lungs even at low levels as seen in colonization produces inflammatory changes similar to those seen in COPD with increases in the numbers of neutrophils and cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes. We propose that Pneumocystis accelerates emphysema in HIV-infected smokers by stimulating inflammation and tissue destruction. We will examine the role of co-infection with Pneumocystis in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated emphysema and the mechanism by which it causes emphysema progression. These studies will lead to information that will provide a rational basis for prevention and therapy of HIV-associated emphysema and provide a model for emphysema in the general population    ,NCT00869544
HIV,Pharmacokinetic Interaction Between the Antimalarial Combination Artemether/Lumefantrine and Combination Antiretroviral Therapy Including Lopinavir/Ritonavir in HIV-infected Adults, Despite the clinical significance of potential interactions between antimalarials and antiretrovirals no drug interaction studies have been published and there is an urgent need to address this gap in current knowledge. The aim of the study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antimalarial combination artemether/lumefantrine (AL) and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in HIV-infected adults.    ,NCT00869700
HIV,A Pilot Project of Virologic Pharmacologic and Immunologic Correlates of Gastrointestinal-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Immune Reconstitution Following Maraviroc Therapy, This research study is being done to find out how the immune system in the small intestines improves after taking antiretroviral (anti-HIV) medications. Biopsies (small snips of tissue) will be taken from the part of the intestines just below the stomach and will be studied in the laboratory. The main purpose of this study is to measure the increase in the numbers of immune cells in the intestines to see if this number is related to the amount of medication that reaches the intestinal tissue and the amount of virus that is still hiding there. Subjects are either normal control subjects without HIV or are HIV positive and are about to start HIV medications. As part of this study HIV positive patients will be randomized to receive one of three possible combinations of medications.   1. maraviroc (Selzentry) in combination with 2 NRTIs (dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) or   2. maraviroc PLUS raltegravir in combination with 2 NRTIs (dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) or   3. efavirenz (Sustiva) in combination with 2 NRTIs (dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) Both Maraviroc and Raltegravir each represent new classes of medications in the way that they interfere with HIV making copies of itself. Maraviroc attaches to the surface of the T-cell that the virus uses to get into the cell and is therefore known as an entry inhibitor. Raltegravir blocks the virus from inserting itself into the DNA of the infected cell's nucleus and is therefore known as an Integrase Inhibitor. We hope to learn more about how antiretroviral drugs affect T cells and how immune function restores itself when HIV infection is treated.    ,NCT00870363
HIV,Prevalence and Pathogenesis of Lung Disease in a Large HIV Cohort-coordinating Center, Despite the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) lung diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in those with HIV infection. There have been no large-scale studies detailing pulmonary complications in the HAART era. Substantial gaps exist in our knowledge of the spectrum and pathogenesis of pulmonary disorders in this population particularly in women and minorities whose numbers with HIV or AIDS have increased. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women's Interagency Health Study (WIHS) are prospective multi-center cohorts that follow approximately 5000 HIV+ subjects and HIV- controls. Although pulmonary disease has not been an area of focus these established cohorts provide a unique opportunity to systematically study pulmonary complications of HIV infection. Emphysema is of particular interest in the current HIV era because it is likely to increase as this population lives longer with chronic HIV. HIV-infected persons have an increased incidence of emphysema compared to those without HIV infection and it has been hypothesized that this accelerated disease progression is the result of one or more latent infectious agents that amplify the pulmonary inflammation. Accelerated emphysema was described in HIV infection in a predominantly male population before HAART. The current prevalence and characteristics of HIV-associated emphysema and the potential impact of gender have not been rigorously defined.    ,NCT00870857

HIV,Maraviroc Immune Recovery Study," Rationale: Improving cellular immunity by means of increasing CD4 cells is one of the goals of antiretroviral therapy in HIV which is achieved by means of virological suppression. A certain group of patients the so called ""immunologic non responders"" fail to reach an acceptable CD4 cell increase despite an adequate virologic response on antiretroviral treatment. Recently a new antiretroviral agent maraviroc (Celsentry®) is registered for the treatment of patients infected with CCR5 tropic HIV-1 virus. However data is available suggesting that treatment with maraviroc leads to immune recovery (increase in CD4 cells) in patients who are infected with dual/mixed tropic HIV-1 virus in the absence of a virologic response. This suggests an alternative mechanism for immune recovery which could be especially beneficial for this group of patients. Hypothesis: Maraviroc by a yet unknown mechanism stimulates immune recovery by increasing CD4+ cell count. Objective: The primary objective is to confirm the hypothesis that maraviroc stimulates immune recovery; the secondary objective is to explore by virologic and immunologic investigations the underlying mechanisms of this hypothesis. Study design: multicentre randomized placebo-controlled double blind exploratory mechanistic study. Study population: HIV-1 infected patients 18 years or older who meet the inclusion criteria. Intervention: One group receives maraviroc (dose dependent on co-medication) the other group placebo. Main study parameters/endpoints: A 30% increase in CD4 cell rise in the treatment group (compared with placebo). Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation benefit and group relatedness:   1. In the treatment group subjects will start with a registered antiretroviral agent (maraviroc).   2. During the treatment year patients will perform several study visits probably three more compared with regular visits on the outpatient clinic.   3. Each visit blood will be drawn by venepuncture for immunologic and virologic investigations (see flow chart).    ",NCT00875368
HIV,Non-Interventional Observational Study With Viramune Plus Antiretroviral in HIV Infected Patients, This observational study is supposed to assess (under conditions of clinical practice in daily routine) whether treatment with Viramune (nevirapine) in combination with ARV e.g. Combivir (Zidovudine and Lamivudine) Kivexa (Abacavir and Lamivudine) or Truvada (tenofovir and emtricitabine) will durably suppress viral load below the limit of detection or will maintain suppression of viral replication (HIV-RNA below limit of detection) achieved under previous anti-retroviral combination therapy after switch to combination treatment of Viramune (nevirapine) and ARV e.g. Combivir (Zidovudine and Lamivudine) Kivexa (Abacavir and Lamivudine) or Truvada (tenofovir and emtricitabine).    ,NCT00876733

HIV,Pilot Study on the Effect of Adding Raltegravir +/- a Second Drug on HIV Levels in the Gut," The ""PLUS"" study is a pilot study to measure the effect of therapy intensification (with raltegravir and optional second agent) on HIV levels in the gut and blood in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with viral load < 50 copies/mL (herein referred to as ""suppressed""). We hypothesize that there is ongoing replication in the gut despite suppressive ART and that this replication can be inhibited by the addition of one or two new antiretroviral drugs whose activity affects a distinct part of the viral life cycle. All study participants will have upper and lower endoscopy at baseline (before intensification) and after intensification. These endoscopies will be used to obtain gut tissue and single cells (for CD4+ cells) .    ",NCT00884793
HIV,Maraviroc in Immunological Non-Responder (INR) HIV-1-infected Subjects, Suboptimal improvement in cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell count is not uncommon in HIV-1-infected patients with suppressed plasma HIV-Ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels and a decrease in CD4 cell count in patients with suppressed or low level viremia has been observed. Although the efficacy of current antiretroviral medications is well established some antiviral combinations are very effective in suppressing HIV-1 load whereas do not exert any effect on immune reconstitution. Both T-cell immune activation and fibrosis of peripheral lymphoid tissue could create an environment in which CD4 T cell count decrease in the setting of low or suppressed plasma viremia is likely to occur. Another fascinating hypothesis which has still to be elucidated is that reconstitution of the depleted CD4 pool is blocked by an excess of glycoprotein 120 (gp120) HIV-1 protein. This extra-production could be counteracted by an inhibitor of the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) co-receptor that represents one of the major docking tools of HIV-1. With this in mind the investigators would like to propose and design a pilot exploratory clinical trial involving a population of HIV-1-infected patients that rapidly reached a virologic suppression without a reconstitution of their immune system.    ,NCT00884858

HIV,Prevalence and Predictors of Neurocognitive Impairment Among HIV-infected Patients, Despite the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment among HIV-infected patients continues to be an important issue. Although severe forms of AIDS-related dementia have diminished milder forms of cognitive impairment have been noted among approximately 30% of asymptomatic HIV patients. Studies among HIV-infected U.S. military personnel regarding neurocognitive function have largely been limited to the early 1990s before the advent of HAART. In these studies subtle neurobehavioral changes were noted among asymptomatic HIV-positive military personnel. This study proposes to determine the prevalence of neurocognitive deficits among HIV-positive military beneficiaries during the era of HAART who are participants of the U.S. Military HIV Natural History Study. The prevalence ascertained in this study will be compared to HIV-negative military beneficiaries who are demographically similar to the HIV positive group. The sample size of the study is to have complete testing on 200 HIV positive and 50 HIV-negative participants; due to the possibility of attrition before study completion the investigators will enroll up to 300 participants (240 HIV-positive and 60 HIV-negative) to achieve this sample size. The investigators' rates among HIV-positive patients found in this study will also be contextualized in the setting of the prevalence of prior neurocognitive deficits seen in a HIV positive U.S. military population studied in the 1990s contemporary rates among civilian HIV-infected persons and normative values in the general HIV-negative population. Compared to other data in the field of neuropsychology this study is novel in that the HIV population studied is composed largely of HIV patients who have been diagnosed early in their HIV infection; have open free access to antiretrovirals to begin therapy earlier than most other cohorts; and consists of highly-functioning educated individuals.    ,NCT00893815

The research hypotheses of this study are: In patients with HIV infection living in the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands (CAIB):   1. The Prevalence of airflow obstruction in patients with HIV infection is higher than in the general population.   2. In these patients the prevalence of emphysema detected by HRCT is common (greater than or equal to 15%)   3. DLCO measurement is a good marker for the presence of emphysema on CT   4. The inflammatory response is different from that seen in patients with COPD and / or emphysema without HIV infection    ,NCT00904384
HIV,HIV and Kidney Function Study, Current methods to assess kidney function have not been tested in people who have HIV/AIDS population. Given effects of the disease as well as potential effects of the medications it is possible that the methods currently used to assess kidney function are not accurate.

HIV,Effect of Bednets and a Water Purification Device on HIV Disease Progression Among ART naïve Patients in Kenya, In many areas of the world most severely affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic insect and water-borne diseases such as malaria and diarrheal disease are common causes of illness and death. In addition diarrhea and malaria are more common and more severe among adults and children infected with HIV. These infections may modulate the immune system affect the replication of the HIV virus and could result in more rapid HIV disease progression in co-infected individuals. Access to practical inexpensive and easy to use interventions to prevent these diseases may be effective in delaying HIV progression. Current Kenya government and World Health Organization guidelines recommend the use of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP/SMX]) to prevent co-infections including malaria. Despite the provision of TMP/SMX to HIV-infected adults infections with malaria and pathogens causing diarrhea remain common causes of morbidity and mortality in many resource-limited settings. In addition TMP/SMX may not prevent all infections with malaria or other pathogens due to alternative mechanisms of action antimicrobial resistance and non-compliance due to adverse events or other reasons. We propose a study to evaluate the impact of providing insecticide treated bednets and a simple water filtration device on markers of HIV disease progression among a cohort of ART naïve HIV infected adults prescribed TMP/SMX in Kenya. In addition we propose to evaluate the effect of these interventions on malaria and diarrheal disease incidence and on compliance with TMP/SMX.    ,NCT00914225

HIV,Natural History Study of HIV Acquired in Infancy or Childhood, Background:   -  About 10000 children in the United States have been living with HIV infection since birth. Little is known about the long-term effects of HIV infection and its treatment on the growth and development of these children.   -  Because of their disease many children with HIV face additional difficulties with their health well-being and development such as success in school and peer relationships. Objectives:   -  To better understand how HIV infection and the medicines used to treat it affect the growth and development of children adolescents and young adults who have been infected since birth or when they were very young.   -  To develop ways to improve the quality of life for these individuals. Eligibility: -HIV-infected patients who were followed by the pediatric HIV program in NCI as of December 2004 or an HIV-infected sibling of a participant. Design:   -  Periodic evaluation of pubertal development; bone mineralization; body composition and fat distribution; liver kidney and heart status; and behavioral cognitive and academic or vocational outcome of the study group. Evaluations include the following:   -  Physical examinations including height and weight measurements and skin-fold thickness testing to measure body fat.   -  Review of medical records and family history.   -  Blood and urine tests including pregnancy test in females who can bear children.   -  DEXA scans (X-ray test to measure bone strength and how much fat muscle and bone is in the body).   -  Neuropsychological testing including evaluation of language thinking and problem-solving abilities.   -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Test using a magnetic field and radio waves to examine brain structure and function.   -  Oral glucose tolerance test: Blood sampling before and one time after the subject drinks a sugary solution to measure the body's ability to use sugar    ,NCT00924365
HIV,CCR5 Inhibitor Treatment Intensification on CD4+ T-cell Recovery, CCTG 590 is a open-label study to evaluate the impact of therapy intensification with Maraviroc (MVC) (a CCR5 inhibitor) to a stable suppressive HIV antiretroviral regimen on the rate of CD4+ T-cell recovery and gene expression profiles. Patients on a stable first-line HIV regimen with continued viral suppression and sub-optimal CD4+ T-cell counts will be eligible for this study. Those who are found to be eligible will have MVC (dose-adjusted to background HIV regimen) added to their current HIV regimen for 24 weeks. After the 24 week intensification the MVC will be discontinued the original antiretroviral regimen will be continued and the subjects will be followed for an additional 12 weeks. The investigators hypothesize that MVC will improve the rate of CD4 recovery. This improved CD4 recovery will be associated with favorable changes in gene expression profiles of genes involved with CD4 maintenance and circulation.    ,NCT00925756
HIV,Cognitive Rehabilitation in Ugandan Children With HIV," Research Topic: Over 110000 HIV Ugandan children are at risk for neurocognitive disorders due to the progressive encephalopathy of CNS HIV infection. Even if clinically stable these children can have motor attention memory visual-spatial processing and other executive function impairment. One-hundred and fifty school-age children with HIV in Kayunga District Uganda will serve as our participants. Fifty of these children will be randomly selected to receive 24 training sessions of a computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CCRT) program called Captain's Log marketed mostly for American children with attention or learning problems. A locked version of Captain's Log which does not direct the child's training in a progressive manner will be administered to a second ""active control"" group; while a third group will be a passive control group not receiving any computer training intervention. Study Aim 1: To compare the neuropsychological benefit of 24 training sessions of Captain's Log CCRT to the active and passive control groups over a 8-week period and at 3-month follow-up. Study Aim 2: To compare the psychiatric benefit of 24 training sessions of Captain's Log CCRT to the active and passive control groups over an 8-week period and at 3-month follow-up. Study Aim 3: To evaluate how HIV subtype ART treatment status and the corresponding clinical stability of the child modifies CCRT neuropsychological performance gains and psychiatric symptom reduction. Outcome Assessments: The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children 2nd ed. (KABC-2) Tests of Variables of Attention (TOVA) visual and auditory tests CogState computerized neuropsychological screening test Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOT-2) and Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) will be administered before and after the 8-week training period and at 3-month follow-up. We have previously used all these assessments with Ugandan children with HIV to effectively evaluate neuropsychological and psychiatric problems. Captain's Log has an internal evaluator feature which will help us monitor the specific training tasks to which the children best respond. Based on our prior research with Kayunga children with HIV we anticipate that about 40% of our sample will be on ART at study enrollment and about 20% will be Subtype D while 60% will be subtype A. We also observed that children with HIV Subtype A are at greater risk for neurocognitive deficits. Analyses: We will compare neuropsychological and psychiatric gains over the 8-week training period and at 3-mo follow-up for our three study groups anticipating that they will be significantly greater for the CCRT intervention children (Study Aims 1 & 2). These neuropsychological gains will be associated with improved school performance over the long-term. Intervention children on ART will have greater gains than those not on ART and HIV subtype D children will have lower viral loads and higher lymphocyte activation levels resulting in greater gains from CCRT (Study Aim 3). Conclusion: CCRT will prove effective and sustainable in potentiating the neurocognitive benefit of ART in HIV children. It will prove viable for assessing and treating children in resource-poor settings.    ",NCT00926003

HIV,Faster Identification of TB and Evaluation of Drug Resistance in HIV-infected People, Early identification of tuberculosis (TB) is of particular importance in HIV-infected individuals as a delay of therapy can be devastating in those with compromised immune systems. Diagnosis of TB in HIV is difficult however because 24-61% of HIV co-infected individuals with pulmonary TB have negative TB test results. In addition conventional testing can take 6 weeks or longer and may not be available at all in many settings. This study is being conducted to see whether some new tests for identifying TB and for identifying resistance to TB drugs are at least as accurate as the current testing methods when used on HIV-infected individuals. The study will also assess whether the new tests can provide accurate results faster than the current methods.    ,NCT00959088
HIV,Assessing HIV-Related Oral Mucosal Disease and Using Saliva to Measure Viral Load, The mouth may play an important part in monitoring HIV progression. Mucosal lesions of the mouth are often the first sign of infection and their development in already diagnosed individuals indicates disease progression. In addition saliva may provide a non-invasive way to track viral load.

HIV,A Phase 2b Safety and Efficacy Study of Boceprevir in Patients Coinfected With HIV and Hepatitis C (P05411 AM4), The primary objective of this trial is to compare the efficacy of boceprevir (SCH 503034) 800 mg three times a day (TID) orally (PO) in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIFN-2b) 1.5 µg/kg weekly (QW) subcutaneously (SC) plus weight-based dosing (WBD) of ribavirin (RBV) (600 mg/day to 1400 mg/day) PO to therapy with PegIFN-2b + RBV alone in adult participants coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and previously untreated chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1. Boceprevir is a potent orally administered novel serine protease inhibitor specifically designed to inhibit the HCV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) protease and thereby inhibit viral replication in HCV-infected host cells. The mechanism of inhibition represents a new mechanism of action compared to both interferon alfa and ribavirin. Based on previous experience with PegIFN-2b and RBV in combination with boceprevir in the HCV-monoinfected population this combination treatment is expected to provide significant benefit to the HIV/HCV coinfected population. Given the high unmet medical need of these participants and the benefit of the addition of boceprevir to PegIFN-2b/RBV it is important to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of boceprevir in combination with PegIFN-2b/RBV in participants coinfected with HIV/HCV. This is a randomized multi-center trial double-blinded for boceprevir or placebo in combination with open-label PegIFN-2b/RBV in participants coinfected with HIV and previously untreated chronic HCV (genotype 1) to be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP). This trial consists of two arms one control arm (Arm 1) and one experimental arm (Arm 2). Participants in the control arm (Arm 1) may receive boceprevir/PegIFN-2b/RBV via a crossover arm.    ,NCT00959699

HIV,Reducing HIV Risks in African American Teens, This study is developing and testing an innovative parent education intervention Preparing Our Sons and Daughters for Healthy Futures. This intervention aims to reduce HIV risk among African American and other Black youth living in high-poverty urban neighborhoods. Investigators working with a community advisory board and focus groups of youth and parents will develop a multi-year set of audio-CDs to promote positive parenting practices that support young adolescents in establishing healthy patterns of behavior. This parent education intervention will be tested in a field trial with families of 6th graders recruited from multiple schools in New York City. Baseline and annual follow up surveys will be conducted until youth enter high school. Families receiving the intervention will be compared to those assigned to either an attention-controlled print materials condition or a non-attention controlled condition. It is hypothesized that youth whose parents receive the intervention will delay sexual initiation and report fewer sexual risks and that their parents will report more positive parenting practices.    ,NCT00963963

HIV,A Pilot Study of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to Evaluate Safety Acceptability and Adherence in At-Risk Populations in Kenya Africa, This study will evaluate the safety and acceptability of an intermittent and daily PrEP regimen using Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate plus Emtricitabine (FTC/TDF) in men and women at risk for HIV and it will directly compare adherence and intracellular drug levels in daily and intermittent PrEP recipients. It will also evaluate the relationship between drug adherence sexual behavior and intracellular drug levels with an intermittent PrEP regimen. In addition it will evaluate the relationship between adherence to an intermittent PrEP regimen and timing of sexual activity in relation to PrEP dosing. The study will use objective medication event monitoring medication event monitors (MEMS) adherence measurement and evaluate the feasibility of newer adherence measurements such as hair sampling and plasma drug levels. The study will also evaluate the feasibility of using SMS (text messages) to collect sexual activity data in an African setting. It will allow study teams and communities to prepare for potential subsequent larger trials of intermittent PrEP. This study is not sized to evaluate efficacy. If the intermittent PrEP regimen is shown to be safe feasible in terms of adherence and achieves intracellular drug levels similar to daily PrEP these data could be used to design a larger phase 2 study with one or more intermittent PrEP regimens. The goal of such a trial would be to provide bridging data if daily PrEP regimens are found to be effective or to prepare for efficacy or non-inferiority trials of intermittent versus daily PrEP. Investigation of immune responses associated with FTC/TDF will also be evaluated in the pilot study. The proportion of volunteers on FTC/TDF with HIV-specific immune responses due to exposures that did not lead to established HIV infection will be assessed at 2-3 time points and compared to responses in volunteers assigned to placebo. Immune responses may be correlated with risk behavior and host factors such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. As noted above very few HIV infections are expected to occur during the study so correlation of HIV-specific immune responses and protection from infection or attenuation of disease progression will not be possible until a larger study is conducted.    ,NCT00971230
HIV,Infant Male Circumcision in Gaborone Botswana and Surrounding Areas: Feasibility Safety and Acceptability, Background: Novel HIV prevention approaches are urgently needed in Botswana and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Although adult male circumcision (MC) has been shown to reduce the heterosexual acquisition of HIV by men by about 60% MC in infancy is optimal for its relative ease lower cost and low rate of complications. We have conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews that suggest neonatal MC (< 28 days of life) would be an acceptable public HIV prevention strategy in Botswana. The government of Botswana is committed to scaling up MC services in the immediate future and they plan to include neonates. Understanding decision-making around infant MC will be essential to maximize the effectiveness of this HIV prevention strategy. Specific Aims: The investigators propose to: 1) determine the acceptability and actual uptake of neonatal MC in southeastern Botswana and identify barriers to uptake; 2) ascertain the feasibility and safety of neonatal MC in Botswana; 3) Estimate what if any advantages would exist for scale up of Mogen Clamp Plastibell or AccuCirc with regard to human resources equipment needs adverse events and acceptability to health-care providers and families in Botswana. Study Design and Schema: The investigators will conduct structured interviews with early postpartum mothers and fathers to determine correlates of neonatal MC acceptability and uptake defined as neonatal MC following informed consent. Male infants will be circumcised by a trained doctor in a hospital / clinic setting by one of three FDA-approved devices that are currently in use in US hospitals: Mogen clamp Plastibell or AccuCirc. Circumcision with Mogen Clamp or Plastibell will be done before 29 days of life. Circumcision with AccuCirc will be done before 11 days of life (FDA approval limit for device). The investigators will also administer questionnaires to the parents at the regular pediatric follow-up visit(s) to assess impressions of / satisfaction with the infant's procedure outcome over time. Provider impressions of the three methods will also be evaluated. Sample size will be 150 infants per arm for a total of 450 infants males circumcised (and an estimated 800 parental questionnaires). Public Health Significance: The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS state that countries with severe generalized HIV epidemics but low rates of MC should offer this surgery as an important evidence-based HIV prevention intervention including among neonates. These two agencies also recommended that additional research on the most feasible safe and sustainable ways of scaling up MC intervention should be performed. This study will be in keeping with these recommendations. Please note the Mogen clamp and Plastibell study arms began as a randomized trial before the initiation of the AccuCirc single-arm portion. Although the settings in which the three devices were studied were similar the AccuCirc trial enrollment began at two sites (Gaborone and Molepolole) only after completion of the Mogen clamp and Plastibell arms which was conducted in three sites (Gaborone Molepolole and Mochudi). Although Lobatse was a site for the first acceptability study with mothers no procedures were performed there. Regarding the reported sample size: the total final sample size includes both parents of newborn boys (because enrolled consenting parents completed questionnaires as part of this study) and boys whose parents consented to circumcision. We anticipated that not all parents who completed the questionnaire would consent to circumcising their baby; therefore when planning the study it was necessary to estimate the number of parents who would participate in the survey (700) to achieve an enrollment of 300 neonates (therefore the initial estimate of 1000). The original study in fact enrolled 302 infants 600 mothers and 19 fathers (total study population 921). The addition of the AccuCirc arm led to a revised estimate of total number of neonates and their parents (total=1250). The final enrollment was of 1235 participants that includes all the participating neonates and parents.    ,NCT00971958

HIV,Non-interventional Observational Study With Viramune (Nevirapine) and Various Drug Combinations in the Antiretroviral Combination Treatment of HIV-infected Patients Who Have Already Been Treated for Approx. 10 Years With Viramune, The question that prompted this study is the extent to which results from clinical trials can be translated into everyday practice (external validity). An observation period of about 10 years extends far beyond the duration of clinical trials. First and foremost are questions about tolerability and the efficacy of an antiretroviral combination treatment with Viramune and other antiretroviral partners. In particular adverse events will be recorded and the therapeutic effect will be monitored via the course of viral load and improvement of the immune system based on the CD4 cell count.    ,NCT00979420

HIV,The St. Marys and The Mater Switch Study, The aim of the study is to determine whether switching from an antiretroviral regimen containing abacavir and/or didanosine to one containing maraviroc will lead to a reduction in platelet reactivity and inflammatory markers at weeks 12 and 24 thereby conferring a reduction in cardiac risk. In addition the study will assess the efficacy of a maraviroc containing regimen in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor in terms of tolerability and achieving long term viral suppression as assessed at week 48. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a rapid reduction in platelet reactivity on switching to maraviroc and that a boosted protease inhibitor in combination with maraviroc will provide a safe and efficacious antiretroviral regimen enabling a reduction in cardiac risk whilst maintaining virological suppression.    ,NCT00981773

HIV,Effect of Rosuvastatin on Endothelial Function," Rosuvastatin belongs to a class of medications commonly called ""statins"" which are medications given for high low density lipoprotein (LDL) 'bad' cholesterol to prevent atherosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels) and lower risk of heart attacks and other circulation problems. Recent studies in the general non-HIV infected population have shown that the beneficial effect of statins in preventing circulation problems is larger than would be expected from lowering of LDL-cholesterol alone. It has been suggested that the additional beneficial effect of statins may be due to the anti-inflammatory effect of statins. The risk of heart attacks and other circulation problems may be high in HIV infected individuals. This may be due to the inflammatory stress effects of HIV. The main purpose of the study is to see if rosuvastatin will have a beneficial effect on the circulatory system in HIV infected individuals even in those who do not have high LDL cholesterol levels. Therefore in HIV-infected individuals with normal or low LDL cholesterol levels but with evidence of low HDL cholesterol levels which may be a sign of low grade inflammation the study will look at whether 3 months of rosuvastatin will lead to improvement in brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) a marker of early atherosclerosis (hardening of the blood vessels).

HIV,HIV Testing in the Emergency Department at Baystate Medical Center: A Pilot Program, Background Recently the CDC issued recommendations calling for HIV screening for patients aged 13-64 when the individual accesses the health care system. For many patients the emergency department (ED) is the primary or only contact point for health care. The rapid HIV test can be done as a point of care test in the ED. Study Objectives A. Primary: 1. To initiate HIV testing in the Baystate ED. B. Secondary:   1. To estimate the resources involved in initiating a rapid HIV testing program in the ED.   2. To describe the process of initiating a rapid HIV testing program.   3. To compare the yield of testing for HIV in patients with known HIV risk factors compared to those without known risk factors.   4. To describe the characteristics of the population tested for HIV in the ED.   5. To determine the number of patients who declined testing and the reasons for declining testing.   6. To analyze ED staff attitudes re: HIV rapid testing in the ED. Methods A trained HIV Educator/counselor will approach patients in the ED to offer free rapid HIV testing at a time they are not currently engaged with the health care provider. Study informed consent and HIV consent will be obtained prior to testing. The HIV educator will obtain demographic and clinical information on the enrolled subjects including prior HIV testing and HIV risk factors. Patients testing negative will be counseled regarding HIV risk reduction strategies. Patients with an initial positive rapid HIV test will have blood drawn for confirmation (Western Blot) and will be referred to an HIV clinic for follow-up and treatment. Additionally to assess acceptability of rapid testing in the ED a brief anonymous electronic survey will be conducted of health care providers in the ED prior to starting this pilot program and following the program. Data Analysis The yield of testing will be calculated as will the seroprevalence of those tested. Among patients who decline HIV testing but agree to study participation (sign consent form) the number refusing testing will be recorded and reasons for refusing will be analyzed. The yield of testing will be compared in patients with to those without known HIV risk factors.    ,NCT00987194
HIV,Maraviroc Intensification and Peripheral Blood Monocyte HIV DNA Levels, High levels of HIV infection within blood monocyte/macrophages (a type of white cells in the bloodstream) increases risk of dementia in HIV-infected individuals. Maraviroc (Selzentry) is a HIV medication that works by blocking the entry of HIV in cells including monocytes/macrophages that use a receptor called CCR5. The study hypothesis is that the addition of Maraviroc to a HIV antiretroviral regimen in HIV-infected individuals with high levels of HIV-infected monocyte/macrophages will lead to a decrease in the levels of infected monocyte/macrophages and to decrease in brain inflammation as studied by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS a form of MRI study).    ,NCT00987948

HIV,Redirected High Affinity Gag?Specific Autologous T Cells for HIV Gene Therapy, This research study is being carried out to study a new way to possibly treat HIV. T?cells are one of the white blood cells used by the body to fight HIV. CD8 T?cells are a type of T?cell used by the body to detect and kill cells which have been infected by foreign viruses or organisms including the HIV virus. CD8 T?cells must identify the HIV virus in order to kill it. Because HIV is constantly changing the way it looks to the CD8 T?cells some of the HIV virus escapes detection and is not killed by the CD8 T?cells. This research study uses a T cell receptor (TCR) protein specific for HIV (SL9 TCR) and adds it to the CD8 T?cells in the laboratory in order to help the CD8 T?cells recognize the constantly changing HIV virus and make it able to fight HIV more efficiently. TCR stands for T cell receptor. TCRs are found on the surface of T cells and allow the T cells to recognize other cells. Laboratory studies have shown that when CD8 T?cells are modified with SL9 TCRs they kill cells that are infected with HIV better than normal CD8 T?cells can. On the basis of these laboratory results there is the potential that SL9 TCRs may work in people infected with HIV and improve their immune system by killing HIV infected cells and thus may help control HIV infection. Two different SL9 TCRs will be tested in this study WT?gag?TCR and α/6?gag?TCR. Two different types of SL9 TCRs are being used in this research study because the laboratory studies suggest that the different SL9 TCRs will function differently depending on the amount of virus in your body. A goal of this clinical study is to test the effects of infusions of either SL9 TCR in the presence or absence of a viral load. All subjects who receive WT?gag?TCR or the α/6?gag?TCR T cells will be enrolled in a Long Term Follow up study to monitor subjects. Subjects will be followed every 6 months for five years following the 1st infusion of the T cells. If the WT?gag?TCR or the α/6?gag?TCR T cells are no longer found in the blood after five years then subjects will be contacted yearly for the next 10 years. If the WT?gag?TCR or the α/6?gag?TCR T cells are found in the blood at five years after the 1st infusion of T cells then the subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the WT?gag?TCR or the α/6?gag?TCR T cells are no longer found in the blood for a maximum of 15 years.    ,NCT00991224

HIV,TMC278-TiDP6-C154: Evaluation of the Possible Influence of Omeprazole Intake - and the pH Increase in the Stomach Triggered by Omeprazole Intake - on the Blood Levels of TMC278 in Healthy Volunteers, The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent by which intake of 20 mg once daily (q.d.) omeprazole influences the levels of TMC278 in the blood after intake of 25 mg q.d.. This study also investigates - in case levels of TMC278 are reduced when co-administered with omeprazole - whether a double dose of TMC278 (50 mg q.d.) or a separation of intake of both drugs by 12 hours may circumvent a decrease of TMC278 levels in the blood below the clinical effective concentration. Omeprazole is prescribed to reduce the production of gastric acid. Since TMC278 requires gastric acid to be properly dissolved and taken up in the blood circulation intake of omeprazole has an influence on the levels of TMC278 in the blood circulation. This effect has been revealed in a previously conducted clinical trial using the combination of 150 mg TMC278 q.d. and 20 mg q.d. omeprazole. The currently proposed study will also further explore the relationship between the levels of TMC278 in the blood at several time points and the acidity of the stomach. Also the short-term safety and tolerability of co-administration of omeprazole 20 mg q.d. and TMC278 25 mg q.d. will be assessed.    ,NCT01001247
HIV,Pilot Study of Text Message Reminders to Improve HIV Medication Adherence in Botswana, While medication adherence is critical to successful treatment of HIV there are few studies of interventions demonstrating improvements in adherence.

HIV,Immunization With HIV-1 Peptides in Adjuvant for Treatment of Patients With Chronic HIV-infection, Treatment: Immunization with a peptide-mix of 17 Clusters of Differentiation number 8 (CD8) T cell minimal epitopes and 3 Clusters of Differentiation number 4 (CD4) T cell epitopes and a new adjuvant (CAF01). The vaccine should induce cellular immunity against human immuno-deficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Target group: Untreated healthy individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection who are not in antiretroviral treatment. Purpose: The primary purpose is to evaluate tolerability and safety of the vaccine. The secondary purpose is to evaluate the clinical effect of the vaccination treatment as measured by induction of new T cell immunity lowering of HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load in plasma and improvement in the patient CD4 lymphocyte blood counts. Design: The experiment is designed as a single-blinded placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial in HIV-1 infected individuals in Denmark. Numbers of individuals: 20 fully evaluable HIV-1-infected patients should enter the study (15 vaccine treated and 5 placebo(saline) treated controls). The hypothesis is that a redirection of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity to selected relatively immune silent (subdominant) but conserved CTL targets on multiple sites in HIV-1 could provide a better immune control of the virus replication. This could result in lowering of viral load thereby prolonging the time to antiretroviral therapy.    ,NCT01009762

HIV,HIV Acquired Lipodystrophy (HAL) Classification Measurement and Fat Response to Thiazolidinedione (TZD) (Pioglitazone), This study is being done to better understand why people with HIV who have taken drugs for HIV begin to show abnormal changes in fat loss or fat gain in their bodies. This condition is called lipodystrophy. Patients who take medicine for HIV and who have lipodystrophy report loss of subcutaneous (sc) fat from the arms legs and face and excess fat gain in the neck and truncal region. They also more likely to have problems with insulin in the body high fat levels in the blood and diabetes. The reason that lipodystrophy develops is not fully understood although some HIV drugs have are very likely the cause. The complications pose an increased risk of fat blockage forming in the arteries making you more at risk for heart problems in the future. Changes in body fat can cause physical discomfort and psychological distress. Management of these problems can be a challenge for the patient's doctor. The investigators propose data collection to determine if there is more than one reason why this might happen in some people and not in others. Laboratory samples being collected: 1) special imaging of the liver; 2) fat collected by needle from the mid thigh and mid-shoulder areas; 3) blood samples to measure the virus t-cells fats and other markers of how the patient's body is handling the virus. This study is being done because science does not fully understand why some patients with HIV who take medicines for the virus have abnormal fat loss or gain and some do not. This research study is intended to help us better understand why and how this happens.    ,NCT01023620

HIV,Study of Effects of Tenofovir on Bone Health and Kidneys During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding, The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (an anti-HIV medication) on the bone health and kidneys of women with HIV during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. The study will also look at the changes in overall health bone health and how the kidneys work in the infants of these women.    ,NCT01066858
HIV,Study of Darunavir/r + Tenofovir/Emtricitabine vs. Darunavir/r + Raltegravir in HIV-infected Antiretroviral naïve Subjects, The triple therapy darunavir/r + tenofovir/emtricitabine is likely to become a relevant first-line treatment option in the years to come. The dual combination of boosted darunavir + raltegravir is an innovative treatment option that combines two potent new antiretroviral drugs one of which belongs to a new drug class (integrase inhibitor). The expected efficacy profile of this combination is promising. Moreover this combination might have a better tolerance profile and has the advantage of sparing the NRTI class. In the context of tenofovir/emtricitabine currently being a reference backbone in first-line antiretroviral regimens we hypothesise that in combination with darunavir/r raltegravir may be an alternative option if its efficacy is non-inferior to tenofovir/emtricitabine.    ,NCT01066962
HIV,Evaluation of the Efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine in Decreasing Immune Activation in Asymptomatic HIV-infected Patients, The purpose of this pilot study is to find out if taking hydroxychloroquine will decrease immune activation (stimulation of the body's defence system) in people with early HIV infection. Hydroxychloroquine is a medicine that has been used successfully for many years to treat autoimmune diseases (diseases in which the immune system causes damage to the body) e.g. lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. It is generally safe in long-term use and easily accessible. The immune system is stimulated in response to infections including HIV so treatments that decrease immune activation may have long-term clinical benefits i.e. delay onset of treatment.    ,NCT01067417

HIV,HIV Fat Redistribution and the Evaluation of Brown Fat, The specific aims of this study are to determine whether HIV-infected patients with significant fat redistribution and ectopic fat accumulation have increased brown adipose tissue using 18F-FDG Positron Emission Tomography techniques. Recent studies suggest down regulation of Dicer a major component of miRNA has an important role in the differentiation and function of brown and white adipose tissue and may contribute to lipodystrophy. Therefore we will expand on recent research in this area by recruiting HIV-infected men with lipodystrophy. We will perform subcutaneous fat biopsies of the dorsocervical and abdominal fat in a subset of HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected men in order to explore further the question of down regulation of Dicer and its implication on metabolic abnormalities in this population.    ,NCT01098045

HIV,Heart Function in HIV-Negative Children Exposed to HIV and HAART, HIV-uninfected children born to HIV+ women have low level heart problems at birth which may predispose them to heart failure arrythmias and heart attack later in life. The impact of these heart problems on future heart health is unclear as it is unknown if heart problems in these children persist worsen or resolve in pre-pubescence. The objective of this study is to characterize heart function in HIV-negative pre-pubertal children born to HIV+ women and exposed to HIV and HAART in utero and compare them to age and gender matched healthy children born to HIV-negative women. Through this objective we will determine if heart problems in HIV-negative children born to HIV+ women and exposed to HAART in utero persists worsens or resolves during pre-pubescence.    ,NCT01107834
HIV,Extended Follow-Up of Participants in Preventive HIV Vaccine Studies in Uganda, Two previous studies of an HIV preventive vaccine the STEP study and the Phambili study were halted because people who received the vaccine were more likely to become infected with HIV. Why this vaccine failed is still being researched but one reason may be related to the recombinant Adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) virus vector used in the vaccine. Two trials of another HIV preventive vaccine that used a rAd5 virus vector were conducted in Uganda. This study will obtain follow-up safety information on participants in those trials.    ,NCT01109342
HIV,H1N1 Influenza Vaccine Immunogenicity in HIV-1 Infected Patients, The overall goal of this study is to study influenza vaccine responses in HIV infected individuals. Immunocompromised individuals require special protection from influenza but may not respond appropriately to the standard killed vaccine. Patients who receive the H1N1 flu vaccine as part of their standard of care will be asked to donate blood samples for immunologic studies. These studies will determine whether participants were able to produce the appropriate antibodies to the vaccine and possibly identify predictors of vaccine responsiveness. Our hypothesis is that vaccine responsiveness to the new H1N1 influenza vaccine will be compromised in HIV infected patients.    ,NCT01111162

HIV,Selective Exposure in HIV Prevention, Unfortunately people most at risk for HIV are the least likely to enroll and remain in prevention programs. In our past work we have learned how to increase enrollment in such programs among this group. We have identified and addressed previously ignored gender-specific and client self-validation issues that conventional interventions often leave not only uncontrolled but often biased against participation. The present work will extend these methods from enrollment to retention. We intend to recruit a sample of 656 at-risk participants through our collaboration with the Duval County FL Health Department for our randomized double-blind trial. Our study will investigate if a meta-intervention video designed for empowering participants as agents of their own change can increase the number of attended sessions relative to a control condition without such a video. This trial will also determine if a meta-intervention video addressing various emotional/social and instrumental benefits of an HIV-prevention-counseling intervention can also increase the number of attended sessions. These two factors will be crossed and their effects on retention will be estimated for different genders and ethnicities. Effects on clients' attention to the return sessions as reported by the counselor will also be explored among participants who return. We will also conduct mediator analyses for investigating if the meta-intervention has mediating influences on corresponding expectations about the return counseling session. As the inclusion of meta-cognitive measures can alter the efficacy of the intervention half of the sample will receive measures immediately (0-10 minutes) after exposure to the meta-intervention before attendance to the next session is registered. The other half will not complete these measures.    ,NCT01152281
HIV,Study of Cell Phone SMS Messages for Prevention of Maternal to Child Transmission of HIV, Optimal development of sustainable health systems must use locally relevant infrastructure. Mobile phone technology driven primarily by local market forces rather than foreign assistance is spreading rapidly through African communities to improve people's personal and business communications. Here the investigators propose using a structured mobile phone communications system for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). The system is designed to improve antenatal linkage to care provide reminders to take PMTCT medications and improve post-natal support and follow-up even when mothers deliver at home. In addition to benefits in PMTCT related outcomes this model allows evaluation of the intervention in a public health setting with the ultimate goal of advancing regional health systems development. The overall goal of of the study is to assess if mobile phones and SMS text messages can be used to help improve prevention of maternal to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV services by strengthening health systems. Specific objectives are: 1. To determine if mobile phone SMS text messages can demonstrate an improvement in compliance with a known intervention ( use of nevirapine) for PMTCT demonstrated by: 1a) improved antenatal care attendance (greater than 4 visits) 1b) increased usage of nevirapine in labour (from 60% to at least 70%) 1c) earlier identification and treatment of HIV positive infants 1d) increased postpartum care for HIV positive mothers 1e) acceptability of cell phone SMS text messages transmission of information among HIV positive women 2. To demonstrate that mobile phone technology can be used as an effective tool to strengthen PMTCT health information systems at the facility level by: 2a) determining factors that constrain or promote the use of cell phone technology to strengthen PMTCT health information systems from the perspective of patients health care providers and policy makers 2b) determining how cell phones can be used as a tool to generate equity statistics for PMTCT programs and formulate equity orientated PMTCT policies 2c) determine if early involvement of policy makers in the study improves knowledge translation    ,NCT01157442

HIV,Antigenic Competition in HIV Preventive Vaccines, HIV vaccines are designed to create an immune response to certain components of the HIV virus called peptides. Previous research indicates that one peptide called Gag may be particularly important for stimulating an immune response to HIV. Many vaccines being studied combine multiple peptides but including other peptides may weaken the body's response to Gag. This study will test whether a vaccine that targets Gag and another peptide called Env is better than a vaccine without Env at causing an immune response to Gag.    ,NCT01159990
HIV,Reduction of Drug Use and HIV Risk Among Out-of-Treatment Methamphetamine Users, There is a need to identify and test effective strategies to reduce meth use and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors in heterosexuals. This project will compare the efficacy of a manually-driven HIV testing and counseling (HIV T/C) intervention with HIV T/C plus a manualized Contingency Management (CM) with HIV T/C plus CM plus a manualized Strengths-Based Case Management (CM/SBCM) model. As HIV T/C is the standard of care the investigators are testing to determine if the investigators can enhance this standard. The specific aims and hypotheses of this protocol are:   1. To compare the relative efficacy of HIV T/C vs. CM vs. CM/SBCM on reducing drug use specifically meth use. Hypothesis 1: CM/SBCM will reduce drug use more than those in CM (which will have more reduction than HIV T/C) potentially mediated through increased service utilization.   2. To compare the relative efficacy of HIV T/C vs. CM vs. CM/SBCM on reducing HIV and STI risk behaviors specifically sex risk behaviors but also needle risk for injection drug users (IDUs). Hypothesis 2: CM/SBCM will have greater decreases in HIV risk behaviors than those in CM (which will have greater decreases than HIV T/C) potentially mediated through reduced drug use.   3. To compare the relative efficacy of HIV T/C vs. CM vs. CM/SBCM on improving mental health status. Hypothesis 3: CM/SBCM will have greater improvements in mental health status than those in CM (which will have greater improvements than HIV T/C) potentially mediated through increased service utilization and reduction of drug use and potentially moderated by baseline meth use.    ,NCT01161485

HIV,A Pilot Study to Determine if Raltegravir Eradicates HIV From Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is permanently established by integrating a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy into the human chromosome a step also necessary to complete the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)replication cycle. Standard treatment of HIV infection suppresses Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)replication and has not been able to eliminate Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)from an infected person because of the integrated Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Raltegravir (RAL) the first approved antiretroviral (ARV) in a new class called integrase inhibitors works by preventing integration of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). For participants with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)who have never taken antiretroviral medications this research study will test whether Raltegravir (RAL) a recommended first-line ARV can eliminate Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)from key immune system cells.    ,NCT01173510
HIV,Text Messaging to Improve Adherence to Clinic Visits and Reduce Early Resumption of Sexual Intercourse After Male Circumcision," Male circumcision (MC) reduces by more than half the risk of HIV-1 acquisition. WHO and UNAIDS recommend that ""male circumcision should be recognized as an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention especially in countries and regions with heterosexual HIV epidemics and low male circumcision prevalence."" As a result programs have been introduced and scaled up for voluntary medical male circumcision. Kenya leads with the largest expansion of services. Early resumption of sexual intercourse after MC may have deleterious effects including higher rates of post-operative surgical complications and higher HIV acquisition among females in couples that resume sexual activity before certified wound healing. In the context of rapid scale-up of MC adherence to post-operative clinic appointments allows clinicians to assess wound healing and to deliver risk reduction counseling. Abstinence from sexual intercourse before complete wound healing would reduce the rate of post-operative adverse events and minimize the risk of HIV transmission from HIV-infected men to their uninfected female partners. To the investigators knowledge the effect of reminders delivered via text messaging to promote adherence to clinic visits and abstinence after MC has not been investigated. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial in which men who will have undergone voluntary medical male circumcision at selected sites in Kisumu will be randomized to receive either the intervention (context-sensitive text messages after circumcision) or the control condition (usual care). This study seeks to determine (a) the effect of regular text messages sent to men after circumcision on attendance of the scheduled 7-day post-operative clinic visit versus usual care; (b) the proportion of men who resume sexual activity before 42 days post-procedure after receiving regular text messages versus usual care within the 42 days post-circumcision; and (c) to identify potential predictors of failure to attend the scheduled 7-day post-operative visit and early resumption of sexual intercourse.

HIV,Raltegravir With Optimized Background Therapy (OBT) in Multiple Experienced HIV-infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of raltegravir with optimized background therapy (OBT) in multiple-experienced HIV infected patients measured by the proportion of patients with undetectable viral load and the mean increase of CD4 cells count at week 24 and 48. It is also intended to evaluate:   -  viral load suppression and the mean increase of CD4 cells count at week 24 and 48 in patients who needed to change antiretroviral (ARV) therapy due to inacceptable toxicity as determined by the investigator including patients who needed to replace T20.   -  efficacy of raltegravir with OBT in HIV-2 infected patients that were included in this cohort measured by the percentage of patients with undetectable viral load and the mean change of CD4 cells count at week 24 and 48. Study hypotheses:   -  Raltegravir with OBT is effective in achieving and maintaining a long term virologic suppression along with a significant increase on CD4 cells count in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected patients.   -  Patients who replaced T20 by raltegravir due to intolerance are able to maintain long term virologic suppression.    ,NCT01190124
HIV,Could Dietary Algae Affect Immunity and Viral Counts in People With HIV?, Drawing inferences from epidemiologic studies of HIV/AIDS as well well as cell culture and animal studies of HIV inhibition by algae we propose algal consumption as one unifying characteristic of countries with anomalously low rates. HIV/AIDS incidence and prevalence in Eastern Asia (<1/10000 adults in Japan and Korea) compared to Africa (??/10 adults) strongly suggest that differences in IV drug use and sexual behavior are insufficient to explain the 1000-fold variation. Even in Africa AIDS/HIV rates vary. Spirulina is part of the daily diet for many people living in Chad where prevalence of HIV has remained at less than 4% for more than 20 years. Average daily algae consumption in Asia and Africa ranges between 1 to 2 tablespoons (3 - 13 grams). HIV viral load is the main indicator of infection however CD4 helper cell counts are most predictive of morbidity and mortality.We hypothesized that the consumption of algae could be important in diminishing the risk of HIV infection and subsequent progression possibly by enhancing the immune response.    ,NCT01195077
HIV,Affect Management for Early Adolescents, Adolescents are at risk for HIV because of sexual and drug use behavior initiated during early adolescence and those with mental health problems appear to be particularly susceptible. Problems with managing emotions may make it difficult for early adolescents to make good decisions about sexual and substance use behaviors. This project will develop and evaluate interventions for early adolescents with mental health issues. An intervention focused on teaching affect management skills will be compared to an intervention addressing a variety of health topics to determine which intervention best reduces risk behavior among this at-risk population.    ,NCT01197404
HIV,R5 Integrase Study in HIV-1 Naive Patients, This is a pilot open-label study of raltegravir and maraviroc in combination for the treatment of antiretroviral naïve patients. The study will enroll 10 antiretroviral naïve patients with CD4 counts ??350 and viral loads > 5000. The subjects will be followed for 48 weeks. The combination of these two agents has the potential to be a potent regimen with minimal metabolic complications. However they have not been studied in combination previously. This pilot study proposes to evaluate this combination in antiretroviral naïve patients to document the safety and efficacy of this combination in order to provide clinicians with a treatment regimen that minimizes the risk of metabolic complications.    ,NCT01204905

HIV,Ethnicity Data in HIV Positive Men Who Have Sex With Men, Are there differences between the way that non-White men who have sex with men living in London with HIV describe their own ethnicity and the way in which their ethnic group is recorded in NHS clinics? We aim to describe the way in which clinics in London currently record a patient's ethnic group. Without accurate data for an individual's ethnic group we are unable to draw meaningful conclusions about their experiences of HIV care. It may be the case that patients from particular ethnic groups require specific ways of monitoring and treating their HIV but without knowing if these people are in a particular group any services directed to them may be wasted or underused.    ,NCT01277458

HIV,Reactogenicity and Immunogenicity of Cervico-vaginal CN54gp140-hsp70 Conjugate Vaccine, A vaccine to prevent infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is urgently needed. Worldwide most HIV infections occur through sex between a man and woman. The vaccine in this study consists of a protein from HIV that has been synthetically produced and linked to a protein that boosts immune responses. It has not been tested in humans before but it is expected (from animal studies) that direct application into the female genital tract (via the vagina) as liquid drops will provoke immune protection at the site of HIV infection. This is less applicable to men therefore only healthy HIV negative women will be recruited. The investigators will recruit at one site which is a university vaccine research centre with experience of running similar trials. The study will last 24 weeks during which subjects will have blood samples taken on six visits and three immunisations over 12 weeks in which 1 millilitres of vaccine is placed into the vaginal by inserting a small plastic syringe. The purpose of this initial small study is to monitor safety of the vaccine and to determine whether it is appropriate to continue into future larger studies in which the immune response to the vaccine is measured.    ,NCT01285141

HIV,TMC278-TiDP6-C153 - A Study in Healthy Volunteers Investigating the Pharmacokinetic Interaction Between TMC278 and Raltegravir, The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of steady-state concentrations of raltegravir (administered as 400 mg twice daily) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of TMC278 (25 mg once daily) and vice versa. Steady state is a term that means that the drug has been given long enough so that the plasma levels will remain at about the same level with each subsequent dose. TMC278 is being investigated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Raltegravir is a commercially available antiretroviral drug for treatment of HIV infection. Pharmacokinetics (PK) means how the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream distributed in the body and eliminated from the body.    ,NCT01288755
HIV,Structured Treatment Interruption (STI) in Acute/Primary HIV," Although the introduction of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy - HAART - has dramatically altered the course of HIV/AIDS true cure is still unattainable and patients are required to take these medications for the rest of their lives. As is well known the prolonged use of such agents is associated with serious sometimes life-threatening side effects metabolic disturbances such as diabetes and an increased incidence of myocardial infarction. In 1999 a patient with acute HIV infection was treated soon after diagnosis (""Berlin patient""). However because of intercurrent conditions treatment was interrupted on two occasions. After the third introduction of therapy treatment was terminated (arbitrarily) and the patient was found to have undetectable virus throughout a follow up of approximately 18 months. The possible explanation of this phenomenon was autovaccination. Other workers have tried Structured Treatment Interruption (STI) in Acute/Primary HIV Infection with controversial results possibly because there were too few cycles of treatment interruption. In a patient treated in our center for Acute HIV infection after initial HAART therapy he underwent gradually increasing interruptions of treatment from 1 to 7 weeks. After complete cessation of treatment the patient was followed for 3 years where CD4 levels were normal CD4/CD8 ratio remained above 1 and the viral load was undetectable. Our plan is to study patients with Acute/Primary HIV Infection who have been treated with HAART for at least one year. Once they have been shown to have undetectable virus (less than 40 copies HIV RNA per milliliter) and CD4 above 500 per microliter with a CD4/CD8 above 1 they can be enrolled in the STI study. The study will comprise 6 groups of 4 cycles of treatment/interruption with an increasing duration treatment interruptions alternating with treatment intervals over a 33 month period. Altogether there will be 24 treatment interruptions lasting from 1 week to 6 weeks. During this time the patients will be regularly monitored for clinical events and laboratory parameters. The purpose of the study is to determine whether patients with acute/primary HIV infection undergoing graded STI can achieve a normal immune status and undetectable viral load on a long-term basis.

HIV,Text Messaging Intervention to Improve HIV Adherence in Rural Drug Users, Many drug users living with HIV demonstrate inadequate levels of medication adherence and are at high risk for disengaging from care. HIV positive drug users are at even higher risk of poor medication adherence and treatment dropout when living far from treatment centers. Rural residence is common in the U.S. South where rates of new HIV infections are disproportionately high especially among ethnic minorities. While there are efficacious interventions to improve HIV treatment adherence only a few have targeted drug users and these have required patients to come into research clinics for adherence interventions. Transportation problems poverty isolation and stigma are known barriers to accessing adherence support among rural drug users with HIV.Additionally most adherence interventions aim to increase adherence but come too late unable to respond in real time to adherence lapses to help patients re-initiate appropriate medication use while remaining in their natural environments. There is a pressing need to develop tailored scalable interventions that detect nonadherence episodes in real time and enhance adherence to HIV treatment immediately. Building interventions upon familiar existing technology could extend their reach into communities of non-urban patients living with HIV overcoming common barriers to care and could ultimately be scaled up to help drug using HIV+ patients nationwide. The investigators propose to develop and test the feasibility and promise of a combined HIV adherence assessment and intervention application for rural drug users using an available familiar technology whose reach will grow exponentially: text messaging via mobile phones. By 2007 84% of U.S. residents had mobile phones with near 100% mobile phone penetration projected by 2013. While technology adoption is often slower in under-served communities the trend is different with mobile phone technology. African-Americans are using more mobile phone minutes per capita and increasing their use at a higher rate compared with other ethnic groups. This technology has great potential to reduce health disparities. In this project the investigators will develop and test the feasibility and promise of a text messaging application and system using Ecological Momentary Assessment methods to detect nonadherence and drug use and immediately intervene to improve HIV treatment adherence in drug users living with HIV/AIDS who reside outside major metropolitan areas. This R34 is a Stage 1b/2a project in the Stage Model of Behavioral Therapy Development that will develop novel interventions and methods and generate preliminary estimates of effect sizes that will determine whether a larger clinical trial with extended follow-up and cost-effectiveness evaluation is warranted. The specific aims of this project are:   1. To identify assessment and intervention features relevant to the adherence barriers and drug use patterns of rural and non-urban HIV+ drug users using formative methods including:   -  structured interviews and focus groups to identify specific barriers to adherence and engagement in care and needs related to drug craving and drug use that should be addressed by the intervention   -  iterative usability testing of components and drafts of the intervention   2. To create a text messaging mobile phone application and system (Treatment Extension by Texting Text) to assess and improve HIV treatment adherence and drug use in real time --Text will be built upon a piloted unidirectional personalized text phone application and system STeM and will include pre- and post-programming usability testing   3. To test the feasibility and promise of the assessment and intervention tool in a randomized pilot trial of rural HIV+ drug users with detectable viral load (VL) comparing Text to usual care   -  Feasibility: Identify recruitment rates consent rates participant flow completion rates and variance of key covariates and outcome variables   -  Promise: determine point estimates and the precision of effects for primary and secondary adherence outcomes including pharmacy refills and unannounced pill counts (medication adherence) missed visit percentage (treatment engagement) VL and drug craving and drug use.    ,NCT01343654

HIV,Non-interventional Study on Use of Darunavir With Ritonavir in Clinical Practice, The purpose of this non-interventional study is a description of use of darunavir in daily practice in retrospective and perspective manner. Darunavir will be prescribed in the usual manner and in accordance with the terms of marketing authorization. The assignment of a patient to a particular therapeutic strategy will not be decided in advance by this study protocol but instead it will be part of the current clinical practice. The prescription of the medicinal product will be clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study. No additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures will be applied to the patients and epidemiological methods will be used for the analysis of collected data. After having agreed with the patient on starting treatment with darunavir and provided that all inclusion and exclusion criteria apply the physician will document the patient's data. Patients will be observed for at least 48 weeks from baseline visit except for those who withdraw from the study earlier. Patients data will be collected at approximately 0 1 3 and 6 months after starting treatment and subsequently every 3 months in accordance with routine practice. The expected number of patients to enroll is about 900. The patients will be treated with darunavir according to the Italian label. The patient must be withdrawn from the study if the treatment with darunavir has been stopped. A last evaluation must be documented when possible and a resistance test will be collected if available for patients discontinuing for virologic failure. At the end of study visit information on therapy given after darunavir discontinuation will be collected. For patients discontinuing for virologic failure data will be collected until the end of the present study and at least two consecutive measurements of viral load after starting new antiretroviral therapy will be collected if available. All data collected must be the result of the normal medical care of the patient. The patient's baseline data will be collected within the first week before darunavir administration (at Visit 1). For patients already in treatment with darunavir baseline and follow up data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively. Further data collection will occur approximately at 1 3 and 6 months and subsequently about every 3 months according to routine practice after initiating darunavir treatment.    ,NCT01375881

HIV,HIV Diagnosis in Hospitalized Malawian Infants," Purpose: The purpose of this research study is to learn about two HIV tests - a clinical ""presumptive diagnosis"" (PD) that a trained healthcare provider can quickly use to determine if a child is likely to be HIV-infected and in need of HIV medicines and an ""expedited"" gold standard RNA-PCR test (expedited PCR) that is done at the UNC Project lab located at the hospital and the result given within 48 hours. Both of these tests can obtain results quickly while the current test called dried blood spot DNA-PCR goes to a lab and the result may take up to one month. The performance of PD and expedited PCR will be compared to one another with respect to HIV-infected infants correctly initiating life-saving antiretroviral therapy. Participants: Hospitalized children younger than 12 months of age who are HIV DNA-PCR eligible at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in Lilongwe Malawi. Other participants will be patient caregivers and clinical officers who provide healthcare for children that could be HIV-infected. Clinical officers will be trained to conduct the presumptive diagnosis test. Procedures (methods): Patients will be randomized to either standard of care (PD and dried blood spot DNA-PCR) or expedited PCR. A consultant pediatrician and a clinical officer will perform the PD. If the PD or expedited PCR test results are positive hospital care could include HIV medicine.    ",NCT01388452
HIV,Safety and Immunogenicity Study of a DNA Priming and MVA Boosting Strategy of HIV Vaccine, While antiretroviral drugs have shown great promise in reducing HIV replication and thus in reducing HIV/AIDS associated morbi-mortality and HIV transmission the cost is substantial and side effects are a potentially limiting factor. Development of an effective safe-affordable vaccine is likely to be the best way to stop further virus spread.

HIV,Discontinuation of Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole Prophylaxis in Adults on Antiretroviral Therapy in Kenya, Both antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevention of opportunistic infections (OIs) have been associated with significantly decreased mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) also known as bactrim is a common antibiotic and used as prophylaxis for OIs. For countries with high prevalence of HIV and limited health infrastructure the WHO endorses universal TMP/SMZ for all HIV-infected individuals. Notably these guidelines were created prior to the scale-up of ARTs. Following ART and subsequent immune recovery TMP/SMZ may no longer be required. In the US and Europe for example TMP/SMZ is discontinued after patients show evidence of immune recovery. Therefore we propose a prospective randomized trial among HIV infected individuals on ART with evidence of immune recovery (ART for > 18mo and CD4 >350 cells/mm3) to determine whether continued TMP/SMZ prophylaxis confers benefits in decreasing morbidity (malaria pneumonia diarrhea) mortality CD4 count maintenance ART treatment failure and malaria immune responses.    ,NCT01425073

HIV,Improving Uptake of Early Infant Diagnosis of HIV for the Prevention of Mother-to-child Transmission of HIV, Early accurate diagnosis is one of the first crucial steps in care for infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) relies upon early diagnosis and results in significant reductions in infant morbidity and mortality. There is little information on evidence-based interventions that specifically target improved attendance of postpartum clinic visits and subsequent infant HIV testing in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of text messages sent to women enrolled in PMTCT programs on adherence to postpartum clinic visits and uptake of early infant diagnosis by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This study seeks to test the hypotheses that (a) text messages sent to women enrolled in PMTCT will improve their attendance at the postnatal clinic within the first 6-8 weeks after childbirth; and (b) text messages sent to women enrolled in PMTCT programs will increase uptake of DNA PCR HIV testing at 6-8 weeks among infants exposed to HIV. This study will evaluate a novel strategy to improve adherence to postnatal clinic visits and increase the uptake of infant HIV testing. If proven superior to standard care the proposed intervention can be easily scaled-up and integrated into existing healthcare systems in resource-limited settings. Findings from this study will provide randomized trial evidence to inform HIV prevention program planners and implementers. This study will also provide further information on the feasibility of using mobile phone-based technology for public health interventions in resource-limited settings.    ,NCT01433185

HIV,A Phase Il of a Therapeutic Recombinant Biologically Active HIV-1 Tat Protein Vaccine in HIV-Infected Anti-Tat Negative ARV-Treated Adult Volunteers, Tat is a key HIV regulatory protein produced very early after infection prior to virus integration and necessary for viral gene expression cell-to-cell virus transmission and disease progression. Previous studies in natural HIV infection indicated that the presence of a Tat-specific immune response correlates with a lower incidence and reduced risk of progression to AIDS as compared to anti-Tat negative individuals suggesting that an immune response to Tat may exert a protective role and control the progression to AIDS in vivo. Moreover Tat is conserved in its immunogenic regions (both B and T cell) among all subtypes. subtypes. Recent data in fact indicate an effective cross-clade recognition of clade B strain-derived (BH-10) Tat protein from the HTLV-IIIB lab-adapted virus strain (Buttò 2003) which was isolated about 30 years ago (Ratner 1985) by sera from individuals infected with viruses circulating at the present in Italy and in Africa thus reflecting the high degree of conservation of the corresponding Tat regions and providing strong formal evidence that a Tat-based vaccine may indeed be used in the different geographic areas of the world since it is capable of inducing a broad immune response against different virus clades. Based on this rationale and on the positive results of preclinical (Cafaro Nat Med 1999) and phase I preventive and therapeutic clinical trials with Tat protein (ISS P-001 and ISS T-001 respectively) (Ensoli AIDS 2008 Vaccine 2009; Longo Vaccine 2009; Bellino RRCT 2009) a phase II therapeutic open label clinical study with Tat protein (ISS T-002 ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00751595) was sponsored by ISS and activated in 11 clinical sites in Italy in HIV-infected HAART-treated subjects (Ensoli F Retrovirology 2015).In this study subjects are randomized into two arms to receive 3 or 5 vaccinations monthly; each arm is composed of two treatment groups receiving 7 5 or 30 µg of Tat respectively.Results obtained in 168 individuals after trial completion (48 weeks) as well as after a follow-up of 144 weeks for a subgroup of vaccines indicated that Tat vaccination is safe immunogenic and capable of reducing the immune dysregulation which persists despite HAART in treated individuals (Ensoli et alPLoS ONE 2010). Anti-Tat Abs were induced in most patients (79%) with the highest frequency and durability in the Tat 30 µg groups (89%) particularly when given 3 times (92%) (Ensoli B.PLoS ONE 2010; Ensoli F. Retrovirology 2015). Moreover vaccination promoted a durable and significant restoration of T B natural killer (NK) cells and CD4+ and CD8+ central memory subsets. Moreover a significant reduction of blood proviral DNA was seen after week 72 particularly under PI-based regimens and with Tat 30 µg given 3 times (30 μg 3x) reaching a predicted 70% decay after 3 years from vaccination with a half-life of 88 weeks. This decay was significantly associated with anti-Tat IgM and IgG Abs and neutralization of Tat-mediated entry of oligomeric Env in dendritic cells which predicted HIV-1 DNA decay. Finally the 30 μg 3x group was the only one showing significant increases of NK cells and CD38+HLA-DR+/CD8+ T cells a phenotype associated with increased killing activity in elite controllers (Ensoli F. Retrovirology 2015). These data indicate that Tat immunization represents a promising pathogenesis-driven intervention to intensify HAART efficacy (Ensoli et alPLoS ONE 2010).    ,NCT01513135

HIV,Seroprevalence of Chikungunya at the End of the First Chikungunya Outbreak in the French Antilles Within a Sample of Patients Treated for a HIV Infection, Late 2013 the first indigenous cases of chikungunya have been observed in the French Antilles. At the end of May 2014 almost all of the islands of the Caribbean were affected by the outbreak. During the large epidemic which affected the Island of La Réunion in 2005/2006 the attack rate was 38%. The most active period was three months. In this context knowledge of the attack rate and the epidemic in the Caribbean is an important issue for outbreak management and modeling work. As the chikungunya virus had never circulated in the Caribbean determining the seroconversion rate can be achieved by realizing a seroprevalence survey among the general population at the end of the outbreak. Another simple method is to estimate the rate in a cohort of patients followed regularly and whose habitat is distributed throughout the territory studied. The follow up of patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the French West Indies is almost exclusively performed in hospitals in department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases.The high prevalence of HIV and homogeneous distribution of infected patients on all of our territories allow to hypothesize that the risk of transmission of arboviruses by exposure to mosquito bites is comparable to the general population. This patient cohort is well suited to study the emergence of Chikungunya in the French West Indie . Primary objective : To estimate the cumulative incidence at the end of the first Chikungunya outbreak in the French West Indies by estimating the prevalence of specific antibodies of chikungunya virus in a sample (randomly constituted) from patients infected by HIV and representative of the general population of Martinique and Guadeloupe Secondary objective : To estimate the frequency of asymptomatic infections by the chikungunya virus in the studied population To estimate the frequency of chronic forms of chikungunya in the studied population    ,NCT02553369

HIV,Integrating HIV and Depression Self-Care to Improve Adherence in Perinatal Women, Depression is a common perinatal complication that can have a profound adverse effect on maternal and child health outcomes. The proposed study will directly address this important but understudied area by evaluating the feasibility and preliminary effect of an innovative integrated intervention approach BEST-maCARE [Better Education Support Treatment for maternal Capacity Adherence REtention in care]. The multi-component intervention is guided by a model drawn from self-regulation and bioecological systems theory. Proactive counseling personalized to the patient and socio-cultural context is delivered by trained clinic personnel (e.g. counselors) to build problem solving and coping skills and linkages to mental health HIV treatment and ancillary services. The theory-guided intervention approach has been found effective in improving the health behavior and outcomes (e.g. virologic) of vulnerable marginalized HIV+ women and men in rural and urban settings in the US (AI38858-ACTG 731; R01NR05108). Although the investigators formative research suggests that it is well suited for the target population its usefulness in addressing significant gaps in care among perinatal women. l women with co-morbid conditions in a different socio-cultural limited resource setting has not been studied.    ,NCT03016546
HIV,Dolutegravir and Darunavir Evaluation in Adults Failing Therapy, D²EFT is a randomised open-label study in HIV-1 infected patients failing first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). The study compares a novel regimen of second-line ART (dolutegravir and darunavir pharmaco-enhanced with ritonavir) with the WHO recommended regimen of 2NRTIs plus a ritonavir-boosted PI (Standard of Care (SOC)). 610 participants from 10 predominantly low-middle income countries will be followed for 96 weeks with the primary endpoint at week 48. The design is based on the hypothesis that the new regimen will be non-inferior to SOC in terms of virologic control while being easier to take economically viable and affording simplification of treatment programs.    ,NCT03017872
HIV,Provision of HIV Self-Test Kit to Emergency Department Patients," The proposed pilot research has three aims: 1) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of provision of HIV self-testing kit in order to increase uptake and engagement of HIV testing among emergency department patients who decline conventional emergency department HIV testing and to increase the engagement of HIV testing at a regular basis for those with an increased risk for HIV (the index participants); 2) to determine the uptake and engagement of HIV testing by provision of HIV self-testing kit; and 3) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of HIV self-testing kit referral among partners or peers of the index participants. The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized study at Johns Hopkins Hospital emergency department on (1) patients who decline routine HIV testing offer and (2) patients who are at an increased risk for HIV. The consented patient will be randomized to HIV self-testing kit group which we will provide a free Food and Drug Administration-approved HIV self-testing home kit for the participant to take it home or to reference group which the investigators will not provide the self-testing kit. Consented patients in both groups will fill out a short survey regarding their socio-demographic information as well as their experience and perceptions regarding HIV testing. For patients who are in the HIV self-testing kit group they will be asked if they would like to take a free HIV self-testing home kit home. Participants in this group will also receive information regarding how to access ""I Want The Kit"" website to report the completion of HIV self-testing at home. For patients who are in the reference group a standard pamphlet regarding the importance of HIV testing and HIV testing venues in Baltimore City used by emergency department-based HIV testing program will be provided to the patients. Follow-up questionnaires will inquire regarding the patient's experience regarding HIV testing since their index visit. When the participants in the HIV self-testing kit group in Aim 1 they will also be provided 5 referral cards for their partners and peers for them to request a free HIV self-testing kit from the ""I Want The Kit"" website. At the 1-month phone follow-up the investigators will ask participants if they are able to give the referral cards to their partner(s) or friend(s) how they think if their partner(s) and/or friend(s) will request an HIV self-testing kit from the ""I Want The Kit"" website.

HIV,Understanding HIV Susceptibility in the Female Genital Tract, There is great variability in susceptibility from one person to another and less than one in a hundred sexual exposures to HIV results in infection. In addition some recent trial of methods to prevent HIV - including vaccines and microbicides - have actually increased HIV acquisition among trial participants for reasons that we do not fully understand. While we know that immune differences in the genital lining are an important determinant of whether a person is infected after a sexual HIV exposure we don't know enough about these differences to be able to accurately assess a person's individual HIV risk. Therefore the development of safe and non-invasive laboratory tests to estimate a person's susceptibility in the genital tract would be useful in clinical studies of new HIV prevention tools.    ,NCT03064425

HIV,Improving Identification of Mental Health/Substance Use Disorders in HIV Primary Care: Pilot Clinical Response, This research is a feasibility pilot of an intervention to respond to positive screening tests for mental health(MH) and substance use (SU) captured through the Patient Reported Outcomes questionnaires (PROs). The PROs are currently performed in the clinic however the results are neither reviewed with patients nor transmitted to providers. This pilot assesses the feasibility of moving the PROs into the clinical realm by having patients review the PRO results identifying an issue to discuss at the patient's next HIV primary care visit and determining whether this process increases discussion of MH and SU disorders in the subsequent clinical visit and/or increases referrals to MH and/or SU treatment.    ,NCT03067948
HIV,PrEP Implementation for Mothers in Antenatal Care, In a region with 15-20% HIV prevalence an estimated 20% of HIV-uninfected women could have HIV exposures in pregnancy. In a theoretical scenario of perfect PrEP coverage all women at risk receive PrEP while no women not at HIV risk receive PrEP (Figure 4). With mandatory PrEP given to all women (similar to the approaches used for malaria prophylaxis) all women at risk would be covered but many women not at risk receive unnecessary PrEP. Our premise is that a targeted PrEP model may be closer to perfect coverage than a universal offer/self-select model. Implementing targeted PrEP through strategies that include facilitation of partner testing with self-tests could add HIV prevention benefit by increasing partner HIV diagnosis and treatment similar to the initiation of PrEP among pregnant women. By implementing these strategies and measuring uptake process and HIV incidence we can inform the best health systems model for PrEP delivery in pregnancy.    ,NCT03070600
HIV,Men's Club: Impact of Male Partner Involvement on Initiation and Sustainment of Exclusive Breastfeeding Among Postpartum Women, Breastfeeding remains the optimal mode of feeding for infants younger than six months. Exclusive Breast Feeding (EBF) among HIV-infected mothers has been shown to be associated with a sustained and significant reduction in HIV transmission and has the potential to reduce infant and under-five mortality. Given the considerable authority among men as decision makers in sub-Saharan African we may be witnessing a missed opportunity to engage men in the education awareness and decision-making for EBF. Understanding the role and impact of male partners on this decision-making process require further examination to inform the development of effective and sustainable evidence-based interventions to support the initiation and sustainment of EBF.    ,NCT03072758

HIV,CC-11050 in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1-Infected Adults With Suppressed Plasma Viremia on Antiretroviral Therapy (APHRODITE), Background: When there is a threat to the body the immune system triggers inflammation. Too much inflammation can damage the body or cause painful symptoms. Some people with HIV feel sick after they start HIV drugs because their recovering immune systems cause too much inflammation. Or their immune systems can become activated all the time. This can cause serious health problems. Researchers want to test if the drug CC-11050 helps treat inflammation in people taking HIV drugs. Objectives: To test if CC-11050 is safe and well-tolerated for people with HIV who are taking HIV drugs. To see if it reduces inflammation. Eligibility: People ages 18 and older with HIV who have been on antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year. Design: Participants will be screened with: Medicine review Physical exam and medical history Blood and urine tests Chest x-ray Electrocardiogram (ECG): Soft electrodes on the skin record heart signals. Participants will be randomly assigned to take capsules of either CC-11050 or a placebo. They will take the capsules every day for 12 weeks. They will continue to take their HIV drugs. Participants will have a baseline visit within 2 months of screening. This includes: Physical exam and medical history Blood and urine tests ECG Leukapheresis: Blood is removed by a needle in one arm and passed through a machine that removes white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. Participants will have follow-up visits 2 4 8 12 and 16 weeks after the baseline visit. These may include repeats of some of the baseline tests.    ,NCT02652546
HIV,Dual Therapy With Raltegravir and Darunavir/Ritonavir in HIV Infected Patients., While 3-drug regimens remain standard of care concerns exist regarding the safety of multi-drug regimens taken for a lifetime. Problems with nucleoside analogue therapy prompted successful trials with ritonavir (RTV) boosted PI monotherapy however long term safety and efficacy of such regimens remains unknown. Clinical trials have shown Raltegravir (RAL) to have potent activity when patients have few active background drugs; it has a superior lipid profile compared with EFV and LPV/RTV. Darunavir/r (DRV) is a potent well tolerated PI with few GI side effects and lipid disturbances and with a high genetic barrier. The investigators hypothesized that RAL/DRV would be a well tolerated and effective regimen for those patients who are failing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors based regimens due to poor tolerability or resistance. The investigators also would like to explore the plasma pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir combined with Darunavir in a sub-group of 12 HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT01258374
HIV,Combination of Insulin Sensitizer and Leptin as Treatment for the HAART -Induced Metabolic Syndrome, The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with HIV lipodystrophy (fat wasting) benefit from taking the combination of two drugs one insulin sensitizer (either metformin or pioglitazone both diabetes drugs) and leptin (a natural hormone produced by your fat cells). Our hope is that they will improve sugar and fat metabolism and positively affect the body fat changes you have noticed while taking HAART.    ,NCT00362440
HIV,Effects of Short-term Growth Hormone in HIV-infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to examine the short-term effects of two different doses of growth hormone compared to treatment with growth hormone releasing hormone on the brain's secretion of growth hormone and the body's glucose metabolism. We hypothesize that growth hormone administration will alter the body's endogenous pulsatile growth hormone secretion and that higher dose growth hormone may decrease insulin sensitivity. We hypothesize that growth hormone releasing hormone will augment endogenous GH pulsatility and be neutral to insulin sensitivity.    ,NCT00795210

HIV,Leptin for Abnormal Lipid Kinetics in HIV Lipodystrophy Syndrome," ""HIV lipodystrophy syndrome"" (HLS) is characterized by loss of fat in the arms and legs with increase in fat in the abdomen and abnormal blood lipid levels. Persons with HLS have high risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome. The investigators have previously shown that the abnormal lipid levels and lipodystrophy in HLS are associated with defective regulation of lipid metabolic rates specifically accelerated lipolysis (breakdown of stored fats) and decreased fat oxidation (utilization of fats for energy). Patients with HLS also have low levels of the hormone leptin. The investigators hypothesize that treatment of these patients with leptin will improve fat oxidation and may slow the rate of lipolysis. Hence the investigators propose to study the effect of leptin therapy on lipid metabolic rates and lipid and glucose levels in adults with HLS. The investigators will use state of the art stable isotope tracer techniques and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) to measure lipolysis fat oxidation and fat re-esterification in adipose tissues and liver.

HIV,Immune Response to Pneumococcal Vaccination in Aging HIV Positive Adults, The investigators hypothesized that pneumococcal vaccination with either the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine PPV-23 (Pneumovax-23) alone or the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV-13 (Prevnar-13) followed by PPV-23 results in a similar antibody levels/functional antibody activity and induce similar pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS)-specific B cell response in HIV positive individuals > 50 years of age HIV positive individuals 21-40 years of age as compared to HIV negative > 50 years of age. The investigators immunized the study groups HIV+ persons >50 HIV+ persons 21-40 and controls (HIV negative) with PCV 13 followed by PPV23 and HIV>50 with PPV alone and examined immune responses to polysaccharide (PPS) 23 (F)14 3 7 (F) and 19 (A) using polysaccharide specific ELISA and opsonophagocytic assays (OPA). Pre- and post-immunization peripheral blood samples were obtained. Extensive B cell phenotype analysis using fluorescent antibodies was used to characterize PPS-labeled B cells.

HIV,Immune Responses to Two Experimental HIV Vaccines in Healthy Adults, Background: The primary focus of the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the NIH is to develop vaccines for HIV/AIDS. The main purpose of this study is to look in detail at the body s immune response to two experimental HIV vaccines currently in development at the VRC. One is known as the rAd5 vaccine and the other is known as the DNA vaccine. These vaccines are made with pieces of manufactured DNA. They do not contain live or killed HIV. It is impossible for study vaccines to give you HIV and they cannot cause you to give HIV to someone else. Both of these experimental vaccines have been given to people before in other research studies. They have not been approved for treating or preventing HIV infection. Purpose: The main purpose of this study is to look in detail at the body s immune responses after the experimental HIV vaccines are given and to assess safety of the study vaccines. Eligibility: Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 50 who are not infected with HIV and who meet the eligibility requirements. Design: Participants will be screened with a medical history (including questions about sexual history and drug use) physical exam and blood tests. The study will have two groups: <TAB>One group will receive one injection of the rAd5 vaccine and have 8 clinic visits over 3 months. <TAB>The second group will have three injections of the DNA vaccine one injection of the rAd5 vaccine and have 12 clinic visits over 6 months. All participants will be asked to provide blood and body fluid samples for testing during the study. Payment for participation will be provided.    ,NCT01386489
HIV,Safety Tolerabilityand Adherence to Co-formulated Tenofovir-emtricitabine-rilpivirine Used as HIV Nonoccupational Post-exposure Prophylaxis in Men Who Have Sex With Men., This study aims to describe the safety tolerability and adherence to the coformulated anti-HIV drug tenofovir-emtricitabine-rilpivirine (eviplera) when given to men who have sex with men (MSM) following an actual or potential sexual exposure to HIV. This biomedical intervention is known as nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis (NPEP). Patients receive NPEP if they meet the criteria outlined in the 2007 National Australian NPEP Guidelines. Three or two anti-HIV drugs are administered for 28-days depending on the severity of the the assessed HIV acquisition risk. In this study eviplera would constitute 3-drug NPEP. Tenofovir-emtricitabine (truvada) a component of eviplera has been used in NPEP at SVH since 2006. This is a multi site prospective open-label non-randomised trial. Participants will be MSM who present at the various recruitment sites requesting NPEP. Initially 50 eligible participants will be assigned to receive eviplera 25mg once daily taken with food for 28-days according to established Australian guidelines for the use of 3-drug NPEP. There will be 7 visits over a 12-week period. Follow-up post NPEP is for 8 weeks. If an interim analysis demonstrates acceptable safety it is proposed to seek ethics approval to increase the samples size to 100 patients to gain more accurate information on regimen completion rate and on-drug adherence. The primary study objectives are:   1. To describe the safety of 28 days of NPEP using co-formulated FTC-RPV-TDF   2. To describe the tolerability of 28 days of NPEP using FTC-RPV-TDF   3.

HIV,Complementary & Alternative Medicine Use in HIV+ Latinos in the US-Mexico Border, The goal of The investigators community-based participatory research study is to identify the nature and extent of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among HIV-positive Latinos on the San Diego/Tijuana border. CAM use among US Latinos living with HIV is associated with delayed utilization of and poor adherence to antiretroviral therapies (ARVs) that may exacerbate health disparities in HIV care access and health outcomes. This study will lead to development of culturally-effective interventions to improve access and adherence to HIV care in Latinos who face health disparities. The investigators hypothesis is that greater use of CAM will be observed among HIV-positive Latinos who report a) crossing the U.S. border more frequently and b) having migrated to Tijuana or San Diego (e.g. from southern Mexico). The investigators also hypothesize that compared to HIV-positive Latinos who report using herbal CAM those who do not use herbal CAM are more likely to be receiving ARVs and report higher levels of adherence to ARVs; Compared to HIV-positive Latinos who do not attend religious services regularly those who attend religious services regularly are more likely to be receiving ARV; Compared to HIV- positive Latinos who report experiencing HIV related stigma those who do not report experiencing HIV-related stigma are significantly more likely to be receiving ARVs.    ,NCT01152684

HIV,Medical Marijuana Use in HIV+ Patients Prospective Cohort Study, The investigators are interested in understanding personal factors such as medical conditions and mental health as well as social and economic factors that influence marijuana (and other substance) use in HIV-positive patients. Several alternative hypotheses will be evaluated in the proposed project:   1. healthier patients may self-select marijuana use;   2. marijuana use may be associated with consequences that create barriers to seeking healthcare;   3. marijuana use may have medicinal value that reduces the need for such care.    ,NCT01536899
HIV,Medical Marijuana Use in HIV+ Patients: Probability Survey, More scientific information is needed about medical marijuana use among HIV positive patients. There is conflicting information about the use of marijuana use of medical marijuana and the associations between them and health status/health risk behaviors/health care utilization. In addition it is not clear whether patients who participate in prospective clinical studies differ from participants who do not participate; if there are differences between those two groups then this would limit generalizability of knowledge about these issues. The goal of this project is to describe the use of marijuana among HIV positive patients and its association with health status/health risk behaviors/health care utilization.    ,NCT01536912
HIV,A Prospective Observational Study to Examine the Effects of Ageing on the 'Pharmacokinetic and Clinical Observations in People Over Fifty', The purpose of this study is to identify medical conditions that may cause particular problems to individuals receiving care for HIV infection over the age of 50. In addition as the effects and potentially the side effects of HIV medication may change with age this study will also investigate the association between age and differing effects of antiretroviral therapies such as treatment outcomes side effects and the levels of drugs in blood. Results from this study may inform future HIV treatment guidelines on how we monitor individuals with HIV infection. The results may also assist in the design of future studies for the treatment of diseases associated with ageing.    ,NCT01737047
HIV,Transplantation and the Use of Raltegravir in HIV-Infected Patients, Raltegravir (RAL) is a preferred option for initial antiretroviral therapy in the most recent HIV Treatment Guidelines and is emerging as a popular choice for use in the specialized population of HIV-infected patients being considered for solid organ transplantation. Data from HIV-infected persons with normal organ function have revealed few raltegravir-associated metabolic complications compared to older antiretrovirals and in general drug-drug interactions with raltegravir are infrequent. The absence of such concerns appears to make raltegravir a potentially appealing option for antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients being considered for solid organ transplantation. At present however little is known of the safety and long term tolerability of RAL-containing regimens in persons undergoing solid organ transplantation. As more HIV-infected patients undergo organ transplantation there is a growing need for good data on such things as the effect of dialysis on RAL concentrations the potential interactions with commonly used immunosuppressive drugs and the pharmacokinetic (PK) /pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics in those with end stage organ failure as well as those with functioning grafts. The proposed study will also examine transplant function and survival in HIV-infected patients receiving RAL-containing ART and will compare it to HIV negative historic controls.    ,NCT01793467
HIV,IMPAACT P1092: Steady State PK in Malnourished HIV Infected Children, HIV-infected children from sub-Saharan Africa often present with severe malnutrition. In severe malnutrition metabolic and/or gut structural derangement may lead to inadequate antiretroviral (ARV) absorption and/or erratic drug levels. The greater surface area to weight ratio in severely malnourished children could also place them at higher risk of under dosing compared to children with mild to moderate malnutrition. However limited data are available on the pharmacokinetics of ARVs in severely malnourished children. This study will address this critical gap in knowledge by evaluating the PK of zidovudine (ZDV) lamivudine (3TC) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in severely malnourished children compared to children with normal nutrition to mild malnutrition.    ,NCT01818258

HIV,Evaluation of a Blood Test to Measure Immune Function in HIV Positive People Compared With HIV Negative People, The health of the immune system in HIV infected people is currently determined from a blood test measuring the number of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T lymphocytes. These cells play a critical role in an immune response. Studies have shown that low numbers (below the normal range) of CD4 T lymphocytes indicates a defect in the immune system. Conversely the number of CD4 T lymphocytes within the normal range generally indicates a normal immune system. When a person is infected with HIV the CD4 T lymphocytes are attacked and destroyed and the numbers decline meaning that the immune system can no longer effectively protect the body from infection or cancers. However when the HIV infected person is successfully treated with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) the CD4 T lymphocytes numbers increase and may end up in the normal range but the immune system may still not function properly as a number of these cells are incapable of functioning properly. It would be interesting to know how functional the immune system is rather than the number of cells. For this the QuantiFERON® Monitor (QFM or CST007) test is an experimental diagnostic test used in this study to measure the immune function from people infected with HIV. The objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the QFM test in HIV infected people compared with uninfected people by measuring the function of the immune system. The QFM test measures interferon-gamma released in the plasma following incubation of heparinised whole blood with a combination of stimulants. As immune function is directly influenced by cells with actively replicating HIV an additional research test called the HIV Reservoir Test will be included to better understand the level of immune function in each study subject. How long will it take? One visit for about 1 hour with Dr. Gatpolintan and his Clinical Study Coordinator to answer questions then about 10 minutes for a blood draw (nine blocks from Dr. Gatpolintan' office). Study outcome measures (Correlation between QFM and CD4 counts and CD4/CD8 ratios) will be assessed including data presentation within an average period of 1 year after study subject enrollment.    ,NCT01904201
HIV,CCTG 593: Testing and Linkage to Care, This is a CCTG sponsored project to determine if those recently screened for HIV would accept assistance to be linked into appropriate health services. After receiving their HIV results high-risk individuals who test negative will have an option to be linked into a study that offers them Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and individuals who test positive will have an option to be linked into care. If they accept tested individuals will be in contact with an ALERT specialist that will help facilitate their linkage. The study's primary analysis will analyze how many HIV screened individuals accept the ALERT specialist assistance.    ,NCT01941121
HIV,Open Label Pilot Study of Darunavir Boosted by Cobicistat in Combination With Rilpivirine to Treat HIV+ Naïve Subjects, Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend the use of triple-drug therapy (two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and either a protease inhibitor non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or an integrase inhibitor) for the treatment of antiretroviral (ARV)-naïve patients. With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) patients with HIV are living much longer. With the increasing lifespan of persons with HIV long-term complications from therapy as well as the occurrence of co-morbidities with aging have prompted HCPs to re-think the current treatment paradigm and consider novel combinations of ARVs. All of the currently approved HIV antiretrovirals have been implicated in causing long-term toxicities; however the greatest body of evidence for long-term metabolic effects has implicated the nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI) class. By utilizing a non-NRTI treatment regimen it is hypothesized that many of these long-term metabolic effects (renal toxicity bone loss body fat changes) can be delayed or avoided altogether. The clinical data on novel combinations is currently limited but rapidly growing and has included several combinations that have utilized darunavir. This study will be the first of its kind using the unique combination of darunavir/cobicistat and rilpivirine. Currently this drug combination is not a recommended option for first time treatment of HIV    ,NCT02404233

HIV,Project ACCEPT: Engaging Newly Diagnosed HIV+ Youth in Care, The proposed study is a two-group randomized repeated measures design that will examine the efficacy of Project ACCEPT (Adolescents Coping Connecting Empowering and Protecting Together) to improve engagement in care among youth newly diagnosed with HIV at five AMTU sites across the United States. Youth will be randomized into one of two study arms; Project ACCEPT the intervention or HEALTH the health education attention-controlled comparison condition. Both arms consist of two individual sessions followed by six group sessions and a final individual session which is expected to take approximately nine weeks after which youth will have four follow-up visits at the following time points:   -  post intervention (immediately after the last session);   -  3 months post the last session;   -  6 months post the last session; and   -  12 months post the last session. The trial will be repeated in up to three waves.    ,NCT01751620
HIV,HIV Posterior Cheek Enlargement, Altered contour of the lower face is a frequent complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV facial lipoatrophy or loss of facial fat commonly results from antiretroviral therapy. Posterior cheek enlargement leading to a bulky and widened lower facial contour can also be seen in HIV. These changes can lead to significant cosmetic disfigurement and have an enormous psychosocial impact on patients. They also make individuals vulnerable by making them recognizable as persons living with HIV. Posterior cheek enlargement has not been well characterized. Both the parotid salivary gland and the masseter muscle are located in the posterior cheek region. Although parotid gland enlargement in a common complication of HIV it is unknown whether enlargement of the masseter muscle also contributes. The investigators plan to study posterior cheek enlargement in HIV positive individuals. The investigators also plan to use botulinum toxin A as a novel treatment to improve the altered lower facial contour seen in HIV. This treatment has already demonstrated efficacy in HIV negative individuals with enlargement of the masseter muscle. Botulinum toxin has also been used safely in the salivary glands in individuals with excessive drooling resulting from neurological disease. In a trial HIV+ patient the investigators have already demonstrated the efficacy of using botulinum toxin A in the treatment of posterior cheek enlargement resulting from both parotid and masseter muscle enlargement. The investigators anticipate this study will increase our understanding of posterior cheek enlargement in HIV and lead to the development of a novel treatment for this important complication. The investigators hypothesize that posterior cheek enlargement in HIV+ patients will in some cases result from both masseter muscle hypertrophy as well as parotid gland enlargement. The investigators also hypothesize that the treatment of posterior cheek enlargement with botulinum toxin A will result in a more aesthetically appealing lower facial contour in HIV+ patients. This has already been demonstrated in a trial HIV+ patient in which there was a dramatic change in the volume of the masseter muscle and parotid gland 12 weeks after treatment with botulinum toxin A.    ,NCT01635504

HIV,Effectiveness of Opiate Replacement Therapy Administered Prior to Release From a Correctional Facility - 1, Much of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is driven by transmission from or to persons addicted to opiates. Many of these individuals pass through a correctional setting each year creating an opportunity for linkage to substance abuse treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of initiating opiate replacement therapy prior to release from incarceration on reducing HIV risk behaviors and drug relapse. In addition this study evaluated the effectiveness of short-term payment versus non-payment of community opiate replacement therapy immediately following release from incarceration.    ,NCT00142935

HIV,Rectal Microbicide Safety and Acceptability Trial of Topically Applied Tenofovir Compared With Oral Tablet, To date the majority of microbicide research has focused on the assessment of the safety and effectiveness of vaginal microbicides used for the prevention of HIV transmission via the vaginal compartment. Receptive anal intercourse (RAI) is common among men who have sex with men (MSM) and there is increasing evidence that heterosexual women in the developed and developing world also practice anal sex. It can therefore be anticipated that once vaginal microbicides are licensed they will be used in both the vaginal and rectal compartments. As a consequence there is a need to evaluate both the rectal and vaginal safety profile of candidate microbicides. Therefore the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the systemic safety of 1% vaginally formulated tenofovir gel applied rectally. In addition this study will evaluate the immunotoxicity of the gel and evaluate its acceptability; it will also use the oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (TDF) rectally-applied tenofovir geland a placebo gel to compare their systemic and compartmental pharmacokinetic (pK) profiles. This study was designed to address the following hypotheses:   -  Vaginally-formulated tenofovir 1% topical gel when applied rectally will be safe using a combination of clinical and laboratory markers including assays specifically designed to measure mucosal toxicity   -  Tenofovir will be detectable at different concentrations in the various anatomic compartments sampled for pharmacokinetics following single and 7-day topical exposures   -  Exposure to tenofovir 1% gel will demonstrate prevention of ex vivo HIV-1 challenge using in vivo drug-exposed tissue as compared to baseline tissue samples   -  Orally delivered single dose 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets will have similar safety profiles using routine blood safety indices as have been established in other trials and will show no mucosal safety concerns   -  The oral dose will have different multi-compartment concentration kinetics than the topical tenofovir and will also demonstrate preliminary (ex vivo) prevention using the explant infectivity assay   -  Vaginally formulated tenofovir 1% topical gel applied rectally will be acceptable to participants as indicated by a score in the upper one third of the 10-point Likert scale on intentionality to use in the product in the future    ,NCT00984971
HIV,S.T.A.R.S.: Sistas Talking About Real Solutions, STARS: Sistas Talking About Real Solutions is a health education intervention for African-American women ages 18-29 aimed at reducing their risk for HIV. A total of 855 subjects were recruited from three Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers. Members were randomly selected from the membership database and sent a letter via mail introducing them to the project and inviting them to participate. Letters were followed up with a phone call and potential participants were screened for eligibility. To be able to participate participants had to be African-American female between the ages of 18-29 single and have at least one act of unprotected sexual intercourse within the last 6 months. Members who were eligible and willing to participate completed a 1-hour baseline assessment survey; STD testing for Chlamydia gonorrhea trichomoniasis and HPV; a vaginal swab that was used to determine if they had unprotected sex. They were then randomized into one of two study conditions: (1) a 2-session HIV risk-reduction condition with a safer sex relapse prevention component (2) a 1-session control condition in which participants receive general women's health information and brochures. Participants received a booster session at 6 and 9 months to reinforce intervention materials. Participants completed an assessment survey and received STD testing at 6 and 12 months. The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of the HIV risk-reduction/safer sex relapse prevention condition relative to the health and nutritional control group in reducing HIV-associated sexual behaviors and incident STDs over a 12-month follow-up period is to implement.    ,NCT01028157
HIV,Raltegravir Use as Nonoccupational Postexposure Prophylaxis (NPEP) in Men Who Have Sex With Men, The use of anti-HIV drugs following a potential sexual or injecting drug use exposure to HIV in order to try and prevent an exposure from becoming an infection is common. This is called nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (NPEP). The likelihood of NPEP succeeding is related to intrinsic qualities of the drugs used which includes at which point in the life cycle of the HIV virus the drugs work how strong the drugs are against HIV and how well tolerated the drugs are i.e. what side effects they produce. Many people skip doses during their treatment or abandon their treatment because of side effects. The anti-HIV drug raltegravir works early in the life cycle of the virus i.e. before it integrates with human DNA is potent against HIV and causes few side effects. These qualities make it an obvious choice for use as a NPEP treatment. In this study 100 HIV negative men will receive raltegravir along with another HIV drug called truvada (commonly used in NPEP) for 28 days after a possible sexual exposure to HIV. They will be monitored closely for adverse events side effects and for their ability to take the medicine each day for the whole 28 days. The hypothesis in this study states that raltegravir use in NPEP will be safe well tolerated and result in a high treatment completion rate.    ,NCT01087840

HIV,Integrated Mental Health Treatment & HIV Prevention for Court-Involved Youth, Youth and young adults in the juvenile justice system have a high prevalence of concurrent psychiatric and substance use disorders and are also at high risk for HIV. However even when the disorders and risks are recognized most programs do not address all of these important problems and long-term efficacy for all outcomes simultaneously has yet to be demonstrated for these multi-problem youth. Adverse outcomes for youth include partially treated or relapsing psychiatric disorders continued substance abuse unchanged HIV risk and further legal problems. This project in collaboration with the Rhode Island Family Court with whom we have existing collaborations will address these issues by implementing an Integrated Treatment Program (ITP) that targets mental health/substance abuse disorders and HIV risk. ITP is novel by targeting multiple adolescent problems simultaneously involving parents to augment change and its delivery within the Family Court. This study will extend our previous efficacious interventions among youth with psychiatric disorders to court-involved youth. Adolescents and their parents will be enrolled from the Rhode Island Family Court Mental Health Clinic where youth aged 13-17 are referred by judges for comprehensive assessment and referral for treatment. This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy among 200 sexually active court-involved youth who need outpatient treatment of the novel integrated treatment (ITP n=100) as compared to enhanced standard care in community outpatient services (ESC n=100) over an 18-month period (6 months of ITP or ESC and 12 months of follow-up). ITP consists of three components: 1) individual cognitive behavioral therapy which includes a motivational interviewing component and is modular-based to address concurrent mental health and substance abuse issues; 2) family and parent training sessions to address parental communication and monitoring to support risk reduction among youth; 3) multifamily group workshops to address HIV risk family communication and peer resistance skills. Youth in both conditions (ITP and ESC) will receive similar case management services from the court and psychiatric medication management (if needed) from a study psychiatrist. ITP will be compared to ESC on reductions in sexual risk behavior substance use symptoms of psychiatric disorders and legal offenses.    ,NCT01421485

In the RCT 384 couples comprised of young female drug users who do (N = 192) and do not (N = 192) trade sex and their primary intimate heterosexual partners will be randomly assigned to one-of-four conditions: (1) testing and counseling; (2) brief motivational interview (BMI); (3) cognitive-behavioral couples' intervention (IFCBT); or (4) BMI and IFCBT combined. Eligibility criteria for couples include an HIV-negative drug using female aged 18 to 40 and their primary intimate partner or spouse who is also HIV negative. Each partner of each couple will be administered assessments with a rapid test for HIV and urine tests for Chlamydia gonorrhea trichomoniasis and drug use at baseline and 3-month 6-month and 12-month follow-up.    ,NCT01554423
HIV,A Study to Compare Three Different Formulations of Tenofovir 1% Gel When Administered Rectally, This is a double-blinded randomized safety acceptability pharmacokinetic and ex vivo efficacy study of three rectally-applied tenofovir-based microbicide formulations. Approximately 18 total evaluable HIV-negative men and women (~9 per site) will be enrolled across two study sites: University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and Magee-Womens Research Institute (MWRI) at University of Pittsburgh. Each participant will experience seven rectal exposures to the rectal-specific formulation (RF) and seven rectal exposures to the reduced glycerin vaginal formulation (RGVF) of tenofovir 1% gel but only one exposure to the vaginal formulation (VF) which will be coupled with six preceding exposures to the Universal HEC Placebo Gel to balance out the VF study stage. Participant accrual will take approximately 6 months and each participant will be on study for approximately 3 months. The total duration of the study will be approximately 1 year. The primary objectives of the study are safety acceptability and pharmacokinetics specifically:   -  To evaluate the safety of each tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation when applied rectally   -  To evaluate the acceptability of each tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation when applied rectally   -  To compare systemic and compartment pharmacokinetics among the three tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulations when applied rectally Secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the mucosal immunotoxicity of each tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation when applied rectally. And the exploratory objective of the study is to assess the preliminary (ex vivo) efficacy of each tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation using biopsy explants after each product is applied rectally.    ,NCT01575405

HIV,Couples in Context: An RCT of a Couples-based HIV Prevention Intervention, The prevalence for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa is 18% among 15-49 year old adults and 30% among female antenatal clinic attendees (UNAIDS 2007) indicating continuing need for effective HIV prevention. Further recent studies in sub-Saharan Africa found 60-94% of new HIV infections are occurring within marriage or co-habiting heterosexual partnerships (Dunkle et al. 2008). These findings signal the need for HIV prevention interventions that target couples in South Africa. This study is a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention to increase HIV testing among couples living in Vulindlela South Africa. The proposed intervention consists of six sessions (one mixed gender group one single gender group and four couples' counseling sessions). Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with 350 heterosexual couples we will test the hypothesis that compared with a one-time mixed-gender group session the proposed intervention will improve communication intimacy and trust necessary for mutual decision-making about behaviours related to sexual risk behaviour and testing for HIV. Improving couples' ability and motivation to participate in Couples HIV Testing and Counseling (CHTC) for HIV will in turn lead to reductions in sexual risk behaviour. Both of these outcomes are necessary and effective strategies to reduce the risk of HIV transmission within primary partnerships. This intervention is informed by several qualitative studies conducted in Vulindlela and Soweto South Africa via a K08 award from NIH as well as other funding sources. These preliminary studies provided insight into the challenges couples face in participating in CHCT as well as the skills they need in order to address these barriers. Our experience conducting both qualitative and quantitative studies with comparable populations (i.e. South African couples) has also informed the recruitment and retention methods in this intervention. The proposed study takes advantage of the infrastructure and collaborative relationships that the PI has developed that have enabled her to implement and conduct research within these communities. The specific aims of the project are to test the efficacy of a theory-based and culturally appropriate couples-based intervention on the following outcomes:   1. Rates of testing for HIV   2. Sexual risk behaviour for HIV (with primary and any concurrent partners). In addition we will evaluate the extent to which hypothesized mediating factors (e.g. relationship dynamics) explain the major outcomes and the extent to which the intervention affects these factors. Ultimately our goal is to facilitate the outcome that members of partnerships learn their own and their partner's HIV status. This is a crucial step for effective behavioural risk reduction yet it is a relatively uncommon occurrence for partners in Vulindlela South Africa. Specifically mutual disclosure of HIV status accomplishes two important goals. First this knowledge can facilitate risk-reduction behaviour within partnerships via effecting positive changes (e.g. condom use) in sexual behaviour with primary and any concurrent partners. Second knowledge of HIV status can increase access to treatment and care for HIV-positive individuals as well as reinforce behavioural choices (e.g. limiting concurrent partners) to stay HIV-negative. As couples are particularly vulnerable for HIV infection in this context increasing testing for HIV and reducing likelihood of behavioural transmission of HIV within partnerships would be a high-impact outcome with the potential to significantly reduce the impact of HIV in an area already severely affected by the pandemic.    ,NCT01953133

Investigators will examine the effects of IMARA on women and girls' sexual behavior at 6- and 12-months.   2. To evaluate the impact of IMARA on theoretical mediators posited by the Theory of Gender and Power and the Social-Personal framework associated with AA women and girls' risky sex. Investigators will:   1. Assess changes in women and girls' Individual Attributes (HIV/AIDS knowledge attitudes and beliefs mental health/emotion regulation ethnic identity); Peer and Partner Processes (partner characteristics relationship power dynamics peer influences partner communication); and Family Context (mother-daughter relationship and communication parental monitoring) at baseline and follow-ups.   2. Evaluate mediation and moderation of theoretical mechanisms on women and girls' sexual behavior.   3. To assess the impact of IMARA compared to FUELTM on sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Investigators will:   1. Test women and girls' urine for three common STIs at baseline and 12-month follow up.   2. Explore linkages between biological outcomes and targeted mediators and moderators of change.    ,NCT02958813
HIV,VRC 605: A Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a Human Monoclonal Antibody VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS) Administered Intravenously or Subcutaneously to Healthy Adults, This is the first study of the VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS) monoclonal antibody (MAb) in healthy adults.

HIV,Experimental Analysis of HIV Risk Assessment Reactivity in South African Clinics, Randomized clinical trials of HIV prevention interventions typically include extensive baseline assessments of the risk behaviors that interventions target. Such pretests have the potential to direct participants' attention to the factors that put them at risk of HIV infection. Evidence from intervention study control groups the motivational enhancement and attitude change literature and our preliminary studies suggest that assessments that lead people to think about behaviors with potentially negative outcomes lead to motivation for risk behavior reduction. As a consequence HIV intervention research using baseline assessments may not accurately predict the impact of a given HIV prevention intervention outside of the research context in particular when interventions are evaluated among high-risk isolated individuals. However the actual effects as well as public-health consequences and mechanisms of HIV assessment reactivity have never been systematically tested. The proposed assessment reactivity study will be conducted in South Africa a country with high levels of HIV prevalence incidence and stigma. The Republic of South Africa's HIV/AIDS epidemic has emerged recently relative to other sub-Saharan countries and yet 21.5% of South Africans aged 15-49 -- more than 1 in 5 people -- are infected with HIV (UNAIDS 2004). Despite the common presence of HIV in South Africa it remains largely a hidden disease and HIV-related stigma interferes with peoples' ability to protect themselves through open discussion or spontaneous reflection on personal risk. Under these conditions it is reasonable to expect a sizable effect from directing people's attention to their HIV relevant behaviors an effect that could be incorrectly ascribed to brief interventions used in low-resource settings. The conditions in South Africa therefore heighten the clinical and public health significance of the assessment reactivity issue in that (a) it is vital to understand how reactivity may affect the results of behavioral intervention trials and (b) it may be possible to capitalize on assessment reactivity through brief assessment-based interventions. This study will allow us to achieve our primary aim: 1. To separate the effect of a brief HIV-risk reduction intervention from the potential effects of two types of baseline assessment commonly applied in HIV intervention research: a detailed calendar-based assessment and a general frequency assessment. The detailed calendar-based assessment will potentially lead participants to observe themselves in specific risk-behavior situations providing them with the opportunity to reassess the risk involved in those situations in light of their health goals and thus motivating them for behavior change. The general frequency assessment will merely prompt participants to estimate the overall frequency with which they engaged in several HIV-related behaviors. The effect of these assessments on participants' sexual behavior will be examined alone and in combination with the HIV-risk reduction intervention. In addition this project has two important secondary aims:   1. To generate urgently needed additional efficacy data for a promising HIV risk reduction intervention culturally tailored for use and found to be effective in South Africa   2. To determine potential HIV preventive effects of different types of HIV risk behavior assessments on risk behavior reduction in South Africa for future intervention development To achieve the above aims the investigators will:   1. Recruit 1500 patients (50% women) age 18-44 from the Spencer Rd. STD Clinic Cape Town South Africa.   2. Randomly assign participants within gender to one of 6 study arms in a modified Solomon Four-Group (SFG) design. The 2 (intervention: standard of care vs. an efficacious theory based HIV prevention intervention) x 3 (baseline face-to-face interview: none vs. basic single-item frequency questions vs. detailed partner-by-partner calendar-based interview) factorial design is depicted below:    ,NCT01580657
HIV,Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid for Protease-inhibitor Associated Insulin Resistance, Rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes are more than 2-fold greater in HIV infected people than the general population. Protease inhibitor booster antiretroviral therapy (PI-ART) which is used by ~50% of HIV infected people in the USA is an established risk factor for diabetes. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) a naturally occurring bile salt improves insulin sensitivity in HIV uninfected subjects although the mechanisms for these benefits are unclear. This study will explore the hypothesis that TUDCA will improve insulin action in people with HIV who are receiving PI-ART. Further this project will clarify the molecular mechanisms responsible for these improvements potentially benefiting society irrespective of HIV status.    ,NCT01877551
HIV,Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM) Neurocog 1&2 Study, The treatment of HIV and the tests performed for HIV care have changed over the last 20 years but improvement of management of HIV-infected subjects is still warranted. The investigators would like to collect and analyse clinical information obtained from subjects who are between 18 and 50 years of age. The investigators will look at routine clinic information such as blood pressure recent blood test results and clinical history. The investigators will then assess cognitive (brain) function by talking and/or written tests. These tests will include tests for memory depression and anxiety. All of those who are identified as having problems with their brain function in this way will be offered onward referral for further assessment as appropriate. Those taking part will be offered a follow up visit at 24-48 weeks after the first assessment to see if there are any changes. This will allow us to understand how brain problems develop get worse or get better over time. No genetic research will be done. Depression is a mental health condition that can be characterized by negative feelings a generally low mood or problems with eating and sleeping normally. Anxiety is also a mental health condition where a person can feel general anxiousness or fear of specific situations or in more serious cases can have panic attacks. Impaired brain function is a condition of the nervous system or brain where the brain does not function as well as it normally should and can include symptoms such as forgetfulness doing everyday tasks more slowly or becoming disorientated to the time of day or the place one is in. For this study the investigators will also collect data from medical records including (and if known)social and educational-related data HIV infection-related data (e.g. date of diagnosis blood test results) relevant medical history (e.g. previous psychiatric conditions) and medication used (e.g. date started the drugs used). The information the investigators will get from this study will be used to inform healthcare providers (doctor nurse health advisor psychologist) on whether it is necessary to routinely assess HIV infected patients for the presence of anxiety/depression and impaired brain function. The investigators will also get information on whether the treatments used for HIV infection make a difference to how commonly these conditions occur in patients.    ,NCT01508559
HIV,IL-23/IL-12 Imbalance and T Lymphocyte Polarization in HIV Infection, Progressive HIV or HIV infection seems to be related to a preferential loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes especially Th17+ within the mucosal intestinal lymphoid tissue and with intestinal mucosal damage and bacterial product translocation which correlates with the hyperactivation of the immune system therefore with CD4+ T cell loss and prognosis. The objectives of this project are to investigate the correlation between the IL12/IL-23 imbalance and bacterial product translocation and to study the polarization infection or depletion of intestinal Th17 ex vivo. The investigators will test the effect of neutralizing anti-IL23 antibodies directed against p40 or less classically anti- IL-23 p19.    ,NCT01942655

HIV,Reducing HIV Risk Among Pregnant Women in Drug Treatment, We propose to develop and pilot test an intervention that addresses both sex- and drug-related HIV risk behavior among pregnant women in drug treatment. In the first phase of the study we will conduct focus groups with pregnant women in drug treatment as well as a focus group with their treatment providers in order to determine key areas of emphasis for an intervention in this population. We will then develop an HIV risk behavior intervention for pregnant women in drug treatment pilot the intervention with 20 women and elicit their feedback regarding the intervention. Following refinement of the intervention we will conduct a small randomized trial (n=60) to examine the impact of the intervention compared to standard care (SC). We expect that relative to SC participants randomized to the intervention condition will have lower levels of sex- and drug-related HIV risk behavior.    ,NCT00332813
HIV,Efficacy of Drug and Risk Counseling Among Methadone Patients in Jakarta Indonesia, According to UNAIDS Indonesia is experiencing one of the most rapidly expanding HIV/AIDS epidemics in Asia. The epidemic in Indonesia has been fueled by injection drug use among heroin users and the national response includes the scale-up of methadone maintenance treatment. Drug counseling is considered to be an integral part of methadone treatment but few studies have been designed to assess its benefits and costs. In settings such as Jakarta data regarding the costs and benefits of drug counseling have critical public heath relevance. The investigators propose to conduct a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of integrated drug and HIV counseling among injecting drug users. This study will be conducted at six methadone clinics in Jakarta Indonesia where the HIV prevalence among injecting drug users ranges between 50- 86% with collaborators from the Drug Dependence Hospital in Jakarta the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University. The specific aims of this four year study are to evaluate the impact of Behavioral Drug and Risk Counseling (BDRC)?a low intensity cognitive behavioral approach that integrates drug counseling and risk reduction intervention. Those assigned to the BDRC arm will be compared to those who receive treatment as usual which includes an initial risk reduction intervention and counseling as needed. The investigators hypothesize that the structured low intensity BDRC approach will be more cost effective and result in higher rates of retention in treatment lower rates of drug use and lower rates of HIV risk. To test these hypotheses the research team in Jakarta will recruit 300 injecting drug users as they enter treatment at the Drug Dependence Hospital and its five satellite programs. Following informed consent procedures research staff will randomize participants to either the BDRC intervention or to treatment as usual. All subjects will be fuly assessed at baseline and months 3 6 9 and 12. The proposed work will be build on collaborations that have been established with the Indonesian Investigator Adhi NurhidayatMD during his NIDA INVEST Fellowship at University of Pennsylvania when he spent time with David Metzger PhD and George Woody MD. It will also extend findings from a WHO study on substitution therapy of opiates and HIV/AIDS that was completed by Riza Sarasvita MSMHS (former NIDA Humphrey Fellow at Johns Hopkins University) and her colleagues at The Drug Dependence Hospital Jakarta Indonesia.    ,NCT01360463
HIV,Sustainable HIV Risk Reduction Strategies for CJ Systems, The purpose of the Texas Christian University (TCU) Disease Risk Reduction (DRR) Project is to develop and test an intervention designed to increase positive decision-making skills among offenders for healthy living including skills for making decisions for reducing disease risk behaviors particularly those involving HIV and Hepatitis B & C.

HIV,Violence and HIV Risk Among Women, The purpose of the study is to test the feasibility acceptability and efficacy of an adapted intervention that is theoretically and empirically guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills model (IMB) and aims at reducing sexual risk behavior among women who have experienced Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as well as such an intervention.    ,NCT01695694
HIV,Disclosure to Family, The decision to disclose one's serostatus to family members creates considerable emotional strain for people living with HIV (PLWH) regardless of gender and sexual orientation. While disclosure to family members has been linked to positive outcomes including increased social support improved health outcomes (i.e. sexual physical mental) reduced loneliness and stress and improved HIV disease management the decision not to disclose can also lead to positive outcomes. To date most research about serostatus disclosure has focused on the act of disclosing - the who what where and when of disclosing - rather than the decision process involved. The investigator's long-range goal is to further refine and evaluate an intervention designed to enhance HIV disclosure decision-making among PLWH. To reach this goal the investigators are proposing a course of study with the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Assess the effectiveness of the intervention relative to an attention-control condition on a variety of primary outcomes related to disclosure and health. Specific Aim 2: Examine the effects of the intervention over time. Specific Aim 3: Explore the potential mediating effects of disclosure decision making on the primary outcomes. Specific Aim 4: Explore potential moderating effects of participant demographics (e.g. gender age) relationship characteristics (i.e. relationship satisfaction proximity importance of disclosure) and contextual variables related to family (e.g. adaptability problem-solving) on intervention effectiveness. Specific Aim 5: Evaluate the effects of treatment engagement retention and expectations on outcomes.    ,NCT02111720
HIV,Biobehavioral Interventions for HIV-negative Stimulant Using Men Who Have Sex With Men, This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of a contingency management (CM) intervention compared to a yoked control condition for eliminating illicit stimulant use and for decreasing time to initiating post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for improving adherence to PEP and for completing PEP following a potential HIV-exposure event. Men who have sex with men who use cocaine amphetamine or methamphetamine frequently also have high risk sexual behaviors during or after their drug use. The objective of this study evaluates whether the use of CM that targets stimulant use significantly aids men who have sex with men who use stimulants and also engage in high-risk sexual transmission behaviors to be able to initiate adhere to and complete PEP thereby optimizing the utility of a biomedical HIV prevention intervention for reducing HIV incidence in this very high-risk group of MSM.    ,NCT01140880
HIV,Screening Protocol for HIV Vaccine Studies, Healthy volunteers will be screened under this protocol for possible participation in a study testing a vaccine against HIV the virus that causes AIDS. Healthy adults 18 to 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Participants must be in good general health with no history of significant medical problems or abnormal laboratory test results. Pregnant or breast-feeding women and people infected with HIV will not be enrolled. Participants enrolled in this protocol will undergo the following tests and procedures within 8 weeks before the start of the experimental vaccine study:   -  Medical history including history of sexual activity and drug use   -  Physical examination   -  Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age   -  Blood and urine tests to evaluate possible medical problems such as liver and kidney function; to evaluate immune function; and to test for HIV hepatitis and syphilis Individuals who are identified through this screening protocol as possible candidates for an HIV vaccine trial will be provided additional information about study options.    ,NCT00031304
HIV,HIV-1 Vaccine Test in Uninfected Adult Volunteers, This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and examine whether it induces an immune response to HIV. A vaccine is a substance given to try to create resistance or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic material) of four HIV proteins called 'gag' 'pol' 'Nef' and 'Env'. Injected into a human the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will see if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or any proteins made from it. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests. Women will also have a pregnancy test. Women enrolled in the study must either be infertile (e.g. due to menopause or hysterectomy) or must agree either to abstain from heterosexual sex or to practice birth control for at least 21 days before beginning the study and throughout its duration. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a placebo (a salt solution that does not contain any active substance) and will be divided into three groups based on their entry into the study. Of the first seven people enrolled (Group 1) five will receive a 2-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If the vaccine is safe at this dose then in Group 2 five people will receive a 4-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If this dose is safe then in Group 3 thirty people will receive an 8-mg dose of vaccine and six will receive placebo. All participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector 2000® (Registered Trademark). At the time of each injection participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after immunization. At home they will record their temperature and any symptoms they may experience including any effects at the injection site for at least 7 days or as long as the symptoms remain. If symptoms occur participants will report them immediately to the clinic staff and if necessary come to the clinic for an examination. Participants will have about 10 clinic visits during the study. Most visits will last about 2 hours; those on vaccination days will last about 4 hours. ...    ,NCT00047931

HIV,Effects of Potent Antiretroviral Therapy on Kaposi s Sarcoma, Background: Kaposi s sarcoma (KS) is caused by a gammaherpesvirus called Kaposi s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). However infection with KSHV is not sufficient to cause KS and HIV infection is an important cofactor. Treatment of HIV with potent antiretroviral therapy can reduce the risk of KS and can also induce regression in patients with established HIV-KS. One mechanism by which HIV is believed to contribute to KS is through HIV-induced immunodeficiency which leads to a loss of immunologic control of KSHV and/or KS itself. However other mechanisms may also contribute. Objectives: One primary objective is to assess the effects of the initiation of potent anti-HIV therapy on specific factors possibly linked to the control or pathogenesis of KS namely serum viral IL-6 and plasma VEGF levels in patients with KS or at risk for KS by virtue of being infected with KSHV/HHV-8. Another is to assess the effects of anti-HIV therapy on KSHV infection. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of potent antiretroviral therapy on established KS and other factors related to KS or KSHV infection. Eligibility: The principal eligibility factors are age 13 or above HIV infection and either KS or infection with KSHV. Exclusion factors include KS that requires specific therapy recent corticosteroid therapy recent cytokine therapy or opportunistic infections requiring therapy. Design: Patients will be treated with potent antiretroviral therapy. For patients with established KS the effects of the therapy on the KS will be monitored. In addition a variety of factors related to KS HIV infection therapy or KSHV infection will be monitored. These include the HIV viral load KSHV secretion in saliva the CD4 count serum VEGF levels and serum IL-6 levels.    ,NCT00006171

HIV,Effectiveness Study Low-Dose Naltrexone Versus ARV's for HIV+, In the vast majority of those infected with HIV virus who are untreated there is deterioration in immune health over a period of months or years inevitably leading to full-blown AIDS and demise. Treatment with ARV's stop or slow down this deterioration if started before a certain degree of progression occurs and has saved millions of lives. The investigators' study hypothesis is that effectiveness of a very low dose of an FDA-approved medication naltrexone hydrochloride (Low-Dose Naltrexone or LDN) will compare favorably to ARV's to prevent progression of HIV+ toward immune deterioration and full-blown AIDS.    ,NCT01174914

HIV,Fluoride Metabolism Bone Remodelling and Mineral Density in HIV Patients Treated With Tenofovir +/- Emtricitabine, HIV+ patients are considered at risk for excessive bone fragility. Several factors could contribute: age male sex low body mass index (BMI) HIV infection per se vitamin D deficiency using tenofovir/a protease inhibitor (time on and/or current use). Tenofovir is used in a backbone of nucleosides/nucleotides analogues with emtricitabine (FTC) licensed as TRUVADA® or without this analogue licensed as VIREAD®. FTC closely resembles lamivudine (3TC) but is 5-fluorinated the daily intake of fluoride is ~15 mg. Fluoride induces bone formation by stimulating osteoblasts of often impaired bone quality. The aim of the study is to compare in a cross-sectional design fluoride levels bone renewal bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV+ male patients treated by TRUVADA® or VIREAD® for more than 60 months. The patients will be randomly selected then matched according to age ethnic origin BMI.    ,NCT01813292

HIV,Prevalence of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease in HIV Infected Patients, Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a major cause of cognitive impairment and disability in the general population secondary to the accumulation of asymptomatic elementary lesions. CSVD is directly correlated with age and cardiovascular risk factors and therefore would be challenging in term of public health care in the future. While HIV patients share the same cardiovascular risk factors and they are often diagnosed with cognitive impairment and frailty CSVD has not been yet described in this population. The global aim is to compare the prevalence of CSVD in a well controlled HIV+ population compared to HIV- controls matched with age and sex. 500 HIV+ patients and 250 age- and sex- matched controls will undergo a screening of the CSVD with a 10 minutes MRI (FLAIR and T2*). Prevalence of the CSVD will be compared between HIV+ patients and controls. General and HIV-specific parameters from their electronic medical records will be compared between HIV+/CSVD+ and HIV+/CSVD- patients. We are expecting to prove that CSVD is more frequent in HIV+ population.    ,NCT02082574
HIV,Assessment of Age-related Hearing Loss in HIV-1 Patients, The ageing process is known to be accelerated in HIV-infected patients compared to the general population. Normal age-related hearing loss (presbyacusia) is a frequent phenomenon affecting more than 70% of people above 65 years. It is believed to be mostly the consequence of a mitochondrial damage caused by oxidative stress. Risk factors for accelerated age-related hearing loss are present in many HIV-infected patients : chronic inflammation smoking diabetes etc. The global aim is to measure the prevalence of presbyacusia in a well controlled HIV positive population in France and to compare it to HIV negative controls matched for age and sex. 90 HIV positive patients and 90 age- and sex- matched HIV negative controls will undergo a screening for presbyacusia (pure-tone speech and evoked-response audiometry). We expect to find an increased prevalence of presbyacusia in HIV-infected patients as compared to controls matched for age and sex.    ,NCT02154971

Such couples face a difficult dilemma when considering their desire to have children: forego condom use attempt to conceive and risk HIV-1 transmission or continue condom use and relinquish their childbearing desires. Based on evidence from rigorous clinical trials demonstrating the strong efficacy of individual interventions for HIV-1 prevention and formative work with HIV-1 serodiscordant couples and clinicians with expertise in HIV-1 prevention and reproductive health in the Kenyan context this study pilots a safer conception intervention that focuses on antiretrovirals (as antiretroviral therapy [ART] taken by the HIV-1 infected partner and pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] taken by the HIV-1 uninfected partner) and timed condomless sex. Additional strategies for couples include diagnosis and treatment of STIs and male circumcision. mHealth tools including SMS and mobile applications are novel and very popular among Kenyans to ease the burden of addressing health problems. This safer conception intervention incorporates mHealth tools to improve couples' experiences tracking fertility indicators and communicating with providers about their readiness to practice safer conception. SMS surveys to collect daily information from women about their fertility signs and SMS messages are used to reinforce HIV-1 prevention including condom use for couples during periods that do not have a high likelihood of fertility. An in-clinic mobile application is used to improve clinician-patient counseling and assessments of couple readiness to practice safer conception. To inform future engagement of mHealth tools the investigators will prospectively evaluate clinician and patient experiences using SMS surveys and the tablet application. Couples with immediate fertility intentions will be followed longitudinally allowing careful tracking of pregnancy and HIV-1 incidence. The study takes place in Thika Kenya.    ,NCT03030768

HIV,Evaluating the Effect of a Novel Web-based Intervention to Increase HIV Testing in Men Who Have Sex With Men, The proposed study is designed to develop and test the effectiveness of a novel web-based HIV intervention to motivate HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). The intervention arm includes the delivery of videos tailored to the reasons MSM have for not getting tested for HIV as well as HIV testing motivational messages sent via mobile-phone text messaging e-mail or instant messaging. The intervention and assessments will be guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills model the Health Belief Model and the Stages of Change theory. The control intervention will be a health promotion message (similar in content to other Peruvian websites) with an invitation for free HIV testing. Testing will be offered at the Via Libre and Epicentro clinic and at a mobile unit whose location will be determined based on participants' demand. The outcomes evaluated will be intention to get tested and actual HIV testing among MSM of each of the trial arms.    ,NCT01760057
HIV,Increasing HIV Testing in Urban Emergency Departments Via Mobile Technology, Because people with undiagnosed HIV will not receive treatment and may unknowingly infect others the investigators propose a mobile computer-based video intervention to increase HIV test rates in high volume urban hospital emergency departments (EDs). EDs offer important points of contact for many of those at greatest risk for HIV. Unfortunately when ED patients are offered routine HIV testing most decline. Our proposed intervention builds upon initial findings from a trial our research team conducted with patients who declined HIV testing. The intervention grounded in the Information-Motivation and Behavioral Skills model (IMB) showed an onscreen physician explaining the importance of HIV testing (to build knowledge and motivation) and modeling a rapid HIV test (to increase motivation and behavioral skill). This brief intervention had a potent effect: a third accepted HIV testing post-intervention. While this preliminary study is highly encouraging it revealed a number of other critical research questions. First it remains unclear what intervention component most strongly contributed to patients' decisions to test: the video content or the offer of an HIV test by a computer rather than a person. Second consistent with the literature participants indicated a community member disclosing positive HIV status onscreen would increase the proportion of patients who test. Third results suggest there is individual variation in the extent to which behavior is more strongly influenced by onscreen community members or experts (e.g. physicians). Therefore the goal of the present study guided by the IMB model is to determine how the investigators can refine mobile computer-based interventions to maximize HIV testing rates among patients who initially decline to test in the ED. At the end of the computerized intervention onscreen text will ask patients if they would agree to an HIV test. Those who agree will be tested by ED staff. The study's endpoint will be post-intervention HIV test rates. The investigators' study will inform scalable interventions for underserved populations nationwide.    ,NCT02154802
HIV,Does Preference-based HIV Testing Increase Uptake in High Risk Populations?, Despite worldwide efforts to promote HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT) rates of testing remain low. Understanding how high risk groups decide to test and adapting available testing options to their preferences has the potential to broadly improve HCT uptake and cost-effectiveness. This study proposes to use a Discrete Choice Experiment a survey method increasingly used by health economists for the design of patient-centered health care options to rigorously quantify HIV testing preferences among two high-risk populations identify their preferred testing options and evaluate in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) the effect of a preference-based HIV counseling and testing (PB-HCT) intervention on testing uptake. At a time of heightened focus on health preferences research and patient-centered care this study evaluates the critical link between preference-based intervention design and efficacy. If the RCT indicates that PB-HCT increases testing rates the testing options evaluated in this R01 can be offered to high-risk populations in the study area and the preference elicitation method and tools can be used to inform the design of testing options that better match the preferences of other high-risk populations and in other settings.    ,NCT02714140
HIV,Using Technology to Match Young Black Men and Transwomen Who Have Sex With Men or Transwomen to HIV Testing Options, Young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) and transwomen in the US are affected by HIV at severely disproportionate rates. A key component of HIV prevention for communities at risk is diagnosing HIV infections through regular HIV testing. A significant proportion of young Black MSM and transwomen have not tested in the prior year. This research study seeks to address low HIV testing rates among young Black MSM and transwomen by testing a brief Internet-based HIV testing intervention optimized for mobile devices. The intervention takes advantage of the variety of HIV testing options now available including the HIV self testing couples-based HIV counseling and testing and traditional clinic-based testing and will provide men and transwomen with a tailored recommendation of their optimal HIV testing approach. The investigators are conducting a pilot randomized study among young Black MSM and transwomen followed for 6 months to estimate the intervention's potential efficacy in increasing HIV testing.    ,NCT02834572

HIV,Nutrition Intervention in AIDS Wasting, There are no guidelines for appropriate nutritional management of weight loss or wasting in HIV infection. Some treatments may increase weight but without improving muscle mass or quality of life. In this clinical trial AIDS patients with wasting are randomized to one of three nutritional strategies and studied over a 12-week period: 1) optimal oral nutrition with counseling and protein and calorie supplementation and a placebo pill; 2) optimal oral nutrition with the oral androgen oxandrolone at 20 mg daily; and 3) optimal oral nutrition with progressive resistance training (PRT). In all participants dietary intervention is maximized by weekly personalized counseling to address individual issues and concerns. Two primary outcomes are assessed: thigh muscle mass and quality of life. Our findings can be used to develop guidelines for standards of nutritional care among AIDS patient with the wasting syndrome.    ,NCT00006167

HIV,Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management for HIV+ Drug Abusers," The primary purpose of this 5-year study is to determine whether a Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) intervention demonstrated to be effective in reducing distress enhancing coping and maintaining health among HIV+ non-drug abusers (see Schneiderman and Antoni 2000) can be effectively adapted for our target population of culturally diverse HIV+ low-income ""Recovering Drug Abusers"" (RDAs). Since the late 1980s members of our research team (i.e. Schneiderman Antoni Klimas Fletcher) have been developing refining and evaluating the effects of CBSM among HIV+ Men who have Sex with Men (MSM). In the early/mid 90s we began to adapt and evaluate the effects of CBSM in other non-drug abusing subgroups that were emerging with increasing levels of HIV seroprevalence (e.g. pregnant women African American and Hispanic men and women). After accumulating considerable support for the effectiveness of CBSM in these subgroups in the late 90s our research team (i.e. Malow Schneiderman Antoni Klimas Page) turned its attention to developing the CBSM for one of the most neglected and understudied populations affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in this country: ""inner city"" minority drug abusers. With supplemental funding on two NIH grants to conduct formative stage1 pilot research our project team has been able to develop and document the feasibility and potential promise of the CBSM approach adapted/translated for RDAs (CBSM-RDA). This application proposes to take the next logical step in continuing this work: conducting a 3 6 8 10 and 12 month follow-up outcome study comparing CBSM-RDA with a matched attention time and interest value Health Promotion Comparison (HPC) condition in 225 male and 225 female HIV+ RDAs with respect to key biopsychosocial health endpoints: distress (i.e. depressive symptoms and mood state) quality of life drug abuse relapse unsafe sex Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (CART) medication adherence and health status indicators (e.g. Viral Load CD4 count physical symptoms).

HIV,Directly Observed Therapy for Community-Released HIV+ Prisoners, The aim of this study is to develop effective interventions for HIV-infected prisoners who are released to the community. The intervention that we will study will be directly observed therapy (DAART/DOT) and we will compare this to the current standard of care that involves self-administered therapy (SAT). All subjects will get transitional case management and all subjects with a prior history of opiate dependence will be offered opiate substitution therapy (buprenorphine or methadone). Hypotheses:   -  At the end of six months those receiving DAART will have a higher level of adherence to HAART as compared to the SAT group.   -  The DAART Intervention will result in subjects having lower viral loads and higher CD4 counts as compared to the SAT group.   -  At the end of six months the DAART group will have a lower rate of recidivism to jail/prison as compared to the SAT group.   -  Over the year the DAART group will be more likely to make repeated primary HIV care visits than the SAT group.    ,NCT00786396
HIV,Effective Aids Treatment and Support in the Free State (FEATS), The aim of this study is to investigate the benefits of ARV treatment to patients to the family members of patients on ARV treatment and to communities at large. The study also aims to investigate the impact of a peer adherence support and a nutritional intervention on measures of treatment success. To this end 648 patients who had commenced ARV treatment in the past month at twelve selected health care facilities will be recruited into the study. In addition 204 randomly sampled households from the communities served by the twelve selected clinics will be recruited into the study. Trained enumerators will at baseline conduct semi-structured interviews with patients and households. Following the baseline survey patients recruited into the study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:   -  Patients receiving ARV treatment and the associated support currently provided in the public sector ARV treatment programme.   -  Patients receiving (a) plus bi-weekly visits by an experienced ARV patient who has been trained as a peer adherence supporter   -  Patients receiving (a) and (b) plus a weekly nutritional supplement in the form of two 400g cans of meatballs and spaghetti in tomato sauce The group of 'comparison' households comprises the fourth group. Trained enumerators will conduct follow-up interviews with all patients and households at approximately six- and at twelve-months respectively. In addition the ARV coordinator and other providers working in the ARV treatment programme at each of the twelve selected health care facilities will be interviewed by trained enumerators at baseline and again at six- and at twelve-months. Clinical data will be obtained from patient files at baseline and at completion of the study. Using these data various outcomes of importance to the study will be compared between the four study groups using experimental and non-experimental methods.    ,NCT00821366

HIV,Treatment Options for Protease Inhibitor-exposed Children, The investigators hypothesize that switching to a regimen based on efavirenz will be as effective and safe as remaining on a regimen based on Lopinavir/ritonavir for HIV-infected children. The investigators propose an unblinded randomized clinical trial to evaluate a simplification protease-inhibitor (PI)-sparing treatment strategy among nevirapine (NVP)-exposed HIV-infected children treated initially with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). HIV-infected children aged 3-5 years who have a history of exposure to NVP as part of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) initiated LPV/r-based therapy in the first 36 months of life or who were enrolled on the control arm of Neverest 2 and who are virally suppressed with a viral load < 50 copies/ml will be included. These children will be randomized to either substitute efavirenz (EFV) for LPV/r or to continue on their LPV/r-based regimen. Eight weeks prior to the primary randomization eligible children will also be randomized to either remain on stavudine (D4T) or switch to abacavir (ABC). Children will be followed with regular viral load and other clinical tests for 48 weeks after the primary randomization. Children in the experimental arm who have breakthrough viremia (-defined as two subsequent viral loads > 1000 copies/ml) on the EFV-based regimen will reinitiate the LPV/r regimen. The primary objective is to test whether the durability of viral suppression is equivalent when children are switched to EFV-based therapy. The primary study endpoint is failure to have HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml and/or confirmed viremia >1000 copies/ml. Secondary aims include comparison of immune preservation toxicities selection of resistance mutations and adherence across the two arms. Antiretroviral drug concentrations and adherence will be investigated as possible explanations for the success and/or failure of this simplification regimen. The overall goal of the study is to contribute to the evidence base to allow expansion of treatment options for HIV-infected children in low resource settings.    ,NCT01146873

HIV,Adolescent Master Protocol, The advances in treatment to prevent maternal HIV transmission to neonates have been groundbreaking. As a result the number of new perinatally-infected children in the U.S. is now small. Subsequent improvements in the treatment of HIV-infected infants and children have been equally remarkable ensuring that most previously infected American children have survived and are approaching adolescence. In addition the number of HIV-infected adolescents worldwide is growing substantially in both resource-poor countries and in countries with increasing levels of health care. Therefore there is a global cohort of children who have been living with HIV infection since birth who are aging into adolescence. Little is definitively known about the impact of HIV infection and its treatment on the maturation process in these children. AMP is a prospective cohort study designed to define the impact of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy on pre-adolescents and adolescents with perinatal HIV infection.

HIV,Peer-driven Intervention to Seek Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV," Approximately 21% of HIV infections in the U.S. are undiagnosed but only about 40% of all adults have been tested. Thus late diagnosis of HIV is common and furthermore treatment delays and disruptions are widespread. Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to test for HIV are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late and experience serious barriers to entering care compared to other groups. The investigators research team has studied HHR in New York City (NYC) as part of the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) studies. The investigators found an HIV prevalence rate of 7.4% among HHR in NYC and only 6% of these infections had been previously diagnosed. Further in central Brooklyn 10% were newly diagnosed with HIV. The proposed study will use NHBS methodology to target HHR in central Brooklyn. The primary goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a peer-driven intervention (PDI) to seek test treat and retain HHR. The investigators will also compare the effectiveness of two sampling methods to reach HHR: Respondent-driven sampling (a peer-based approach) versus venue-based sampling (a location-based approach). The two main study hypotheses are: (H1): Participants recruited by respondent-driven sampling (RDS) will be more likely to test positive for HIV compared to those recruited via venue-based sampling (VBS). H2): Participants in the ""Test and Treat: phase of the peer-driven intervention (all of whom will be HIV-infected) will show a shorter time to an HIV clinical appointment a shorter time to starting HIV medication (when medically indicated) higher rates of viral load suppression and higher rates of retention in care compared to those in the control arm.

HIV,Swaziland Safe Generations, The purpose of this study is to understand how best to provide care and treatment services to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive pregnant women and their babies in Swaziland. The study is designed to evaluate a new approach for Preventing Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT)where all HIV positive pregnant women initiate lifelong triple antiretroviral (ARV) therapy regardless of their disease stage. The goal is to prevent delays in women accessing treatment for their own health and ensure that women and their children remain in care. This study will compare this new approach to PMTCT known as Option B+ to Option A which is the current standard of care for PMTCT in Swaziland. The study will be conducted at 10 health facilities in the Manzini and Lubombo regions in Swaziland. The study has three components: the main component is a PMTCT Options Evaluation where data from medical records will be abstracted on all HIV positive pregnant women attending antenatal services at the 10 selected study facilities; data will be abstracted on their HIV exposed infants as well. Other components of the study include a PMTCT Options Acceptability Evaluation using semi-structured questionnaires with PMTCT clients and health care workers (HCWs) as well as a cost effectiveness evaluation comparing costs under conditions of Option A and Option B+.    ,NCT01891799

HIV,RCT of an Integrative Intervention for Non-Treatment-Seeking Meth Users, In the era of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) efforts are needed to identify evidence-based combination prevention approaches that achieve greater decreases HIV viral load among populations that are more likely to engage in HIV transmission risk behavior. Because methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) are at greater risk for acquiring and transmitting medication-resistant strains of HIV interventions targeting stimulant use in this population of high-risk men could boost the effectiveness of TasP. At present only conditional cash transfer approaches such as contingency management (CM) have demonstrated short- term efficacy in reducing stimulant use among substance-using MSM who are not actively seeking formal treatment. The proposed RCT will examine the efficacy of a positive affect intervention that is designed to optimize the effectiveness of CM to achieve long-term reductions in stimulant use and HIV viral load in this population. the investigators' team will examine the efficacy of this integrative intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 230 HIV-positive methamphetamine-using MSM. After enrolling in CM participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) the positive affect intervention; or 2) a attention-matched control condition. Follow-up data will be collected at 3 6 and 12 months post-randomization. This RCT will provide an opportunity to examine the efficacy of an integrative intervention designed to promote long-term reductions in HIV viral load as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes that will be examined include: increases positive affect reductions in stimulant use improvements in T-helper (CD4+) count and decreases HIV transmission risk behavior.

HIV,Mother Infant Retention for Health: MIR4Health, Linking HIV-infected pregnant women into prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) services and keeping them in care is important in ensuring that both mother and infant beneﬁt from interventions that improve maternal health and decrease HIV transmission to infants. We propose an evaluation of strategies to link newly diagnosed HIV-infected women to care and keep them in care during pregnancy and after delivery in our study called MIR4HEALTH. The study will be conducted in Nyanza Province Kenya. All participants will provide informed consent and will be randomized to receive the intervention including individualized patient education adherence support and phone call/Short Message Service (SMS) reminders for clinic appointments or the standard of care (no additional intervention services).    ,NCT01962220
HIV,Quantifying Drug Adherence and Drug Exposure to Antiretroviral Therapy, The purpose of this study is to evaluate cumulative exposure to tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) using dried blood spots (DBS) in treated HIV-infected patients who are receiving a TFV-based regimen. Using DBS will allow the investigators to assess this simple method to measure drug exposure in the clinical setting. The investigators hypothesize that TFV-DP levels will be lowest in individuals with a detectable viral load and highest in those with viral suppression.    ,NCT02012621
HIV,Effect of Omega 3 Fatty Acids on Oxidative Stress in HIV Seropositive Patients, Introduction: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has showed its effectiveness in the prevention of complications in seropositive for HIV patients. However they develop some manifestations such as lipodystrophy dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance increasing cardiovascular risk. Clinical trials in general population and in patients on hemodialysis have demonstrated a significant reduction in cardiovascular events using fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids are believed to be beneficial in prevention of atherosclerosis reducing lipids levels specially triglycerides. Also in general populations it has been described a benefit effect of omega 3 acids on oxidative stress. Objective: to know the effect of omega 3 acids on different markers of oxidative stress in seropositive HIV patients. Methods: We will perform a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial in seropositive HIV patients from 20 to 55 years old on clinical score A1 A2 B1 or B2 who received HAART. They will be randomly assigned to receive omega 3 fatty acids 2.4 g (Zonelabs Marblehead MA) or placebo for 6 months. At baseline anthropometric measurements lipid profile glucose and stress oxidative levels (nitric oxide malondialdehyde total glutathion and lipid peroxidation products) will be evaluated. Sample size was calculated according to different variables. We selected the biggest one calculated for a difference in nitric oxide of 25% after treatment between groups and a standard deviation (SD) value of 10µmol/L. Whit this information we obtained a sample size of 31 patients per group for an 80% statistical power with α= 0.05. Assuming a 15% patient lost a sample size of 35 per group was considered.    ,NCT02041520
HIV,Does Provision of Point of Care CD4 Technology and Early Knowledge of CD4 Levels Affect Early Initiation and Retention on Anti-retroviral Treatment (ART) in HIV Positive Pregnant Women in the Context of Option B+ for PMTCT?, The study will be conducted at 32 health care facilities in three provinces in Zimbabwe and will compare the impact of the provision Point of Care CD4 technology and early knowledge of CD4 levels on retention at 12 months with or without POC CD4 and a programmatic mentoring package. Option B+ will be implemented at all sites and 16 intervention sites will receive POC CD4 machines and visits from a team of clinical mentors. The study also aims to assess rates of ART initiation and time to ART initiation of HIV positive pregnant women in settings implementing option B+ with or without POC CD4 and related counselling/support; rates of retention in care of HIV positive mothers at 6 months post ART initiation in settings implementing option B+ with or without POC CD4 and related counselling/support; rates of ART initiation and retention at 6 and 12 months post ART initiation according to different levels of CD4 count; cost of retaining HIV positive pregnant women until 6 and 12 months; acceptability and feasibility of POC CD4 as an adjunct to good clinical care of HIV positive pregnant women.    ,NCT02070900

HIV,Antiretroviral Adherence and Quality-of-life Support for HIV+ Patients in India With Twice-daily Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Calls With Health and Mental Health Messaging Compared to Weekly IVR Survey Only Control Condition: The Mobile-messaging Adherence and Support for Health Study India.," The purpose of this study is to test whether twice-daily Interactive Voice Response (IVR) calls made at the estimated times of patients' antiretroviral (ART) medication dosing and three reminder calls for monthly clinic appointments will result in improvements in ART adherence appointment attendance health indicators (CD4 cell counts) coping skills social support depressive symptoms and other quality-of-life indicators compared to a control group receiving one IVR assessment call each week over six months. This is a randomized controlled trial of the IVR intervention with n=400 PLH taking first line ART in India on a twice-a-day dosing schedule. The research is supported by an Indo-U.S. Bilateral review and funding collaboration between NIH and ICMR. The research is being implemented in Kolkata by Drs. Smarajit Jana (PI India) and Protim Ray (Project Director) at Durbar a community-based organization providing HIV/STD prevention and community development programs with sex workers and other at-risk communities. This is Phase 2 of a two-phase pilot project. Phase 1 was a one-month no-control pilot (n=46) for feasibility acceptability and patient feedback on preferences for messaging content. Phase 2 has two sites described as Phases 2A and 2b which will occur simultaneously and differ only in their recruitment sites and corresponding sampling strategy (sample size gender ratio eligibility criteria) based on site population characteristics.   -  Phase 2A will recruit n=80 women and n=20 men from Durbar's Mamata Care and Treatment Center (MCTC) (providing HIV testing and treatment linkage and support) and associated Mamata Network of Positive Women (MNPW) which focus on HIV+ sex workers and their male partners and networks.   -  Phase 2B will recruit n=100 women and n=200 men from the ART Centre at the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine (STM) which hosts the largest ART center in the Northeast Region of India and has over 3000 active patients on first line ART. The sampling plan reflects the gender distribution of clients and patients at the two sites. Participants will be randomized within each site and gender sub-sample to receive:   -  The IVR Intervention: consisting of two (2) automated voice calls (""intervention messages"") each day for six months PLUS one IVR assessment call (consisting of four [4] questions) every week for 6 months; OR   -  The Control Condition: consisting of standard care PLUS one IVR assessment call (consisting of four [4] questions) every week for 6 months. All participants will be interviewed in-person by a research team member at baseline and followed-up at 2- 4- and 6-months using structured questionnaires and recording information from the participant's personal medical record (i.e. their ""ART Card"") to assess background characteristics and intervention impacts on ART adherence health quality-of-life (i.e. depressive symptoms social support). All participants will receive one IVR assessment phone call (consisting of four (4) questions during each week of the 6 month study. Each once-a-week IVR assessment will ask about missed medication and the participant's health/quality of life and participants will respond by keying in a 1 (yes) or 2 (no) on their mobile phone.

HIV,Efficacy and Safety Study of Darunavir for the Treatment of HIV/AIDS," The aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility efficacy and safety of Darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (DRV/r) monotherapy as a switch-maintenance strategy for patients receiving second-line ART at Yaoundé Central Hospital in Cameroon. HIV-infected adults receiving second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for ?? months with 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) will undergo plasma HIV-1 RNA (""viral"") load testing. Those with a viral load below 50 copies/ml (<50 cps/ml) will undergo a repeat test ideally 4-6 weeks later (allowed up to 12 weeks); if the viral load is confirmed as <50 cps/ml the patient will be invited to join the randomised phase of the study. Patients (n=150) will be randomised 1:2 to either continue the current triple ART regimen (n=50) or switch to DRV/r monotherapy (n=100). The primary end-point will be viral load suppression <400 cps/ml at week 24; secondary end-points will be viral load suppression <50 cps/ml at week 12 and week 24 safety tolerability and emergence of protease inhibitor (PI) drug-resistance. Patients will continue observational follow-up depending on the treatment arm they are randomized to. After week 48 patients will return to local standard of care. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenomics sub-study to correlate plasma concentrations of DRV to outcomes HIV-1 drug resistance testing sub study to detect mutants archived at the time of first-line ART failure and measuring HIV DNA load will be performed as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis will test the hypothesis that savings can be achieved by switching to DRV/r monotherapy without affecting quality of care. The primary virological objective is to evaluate efficacy in terms of the percentage of subjects who have plasma HIV-1 RNA levels <400 cps/ml after 24 weeks of follow-up following a switch to DRV/r monotherapy versus continuing triple therapy containing 2 NRTIs + LPV/r (or ATV/r) (FDA Snapshot method). Study hypothesis: we propose that maintenance therapy with DRV/r monotherapy is a feasible effective and safe treatment option for patients receiving second-line ART in Yaoundé.    ",NCT02155101

HIV,Effectiveness of Peer Navigation and Contingency Management on Retention in HIV Care, Consistent treatment with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral load (VL) prolonging life and improving quality of life for HIV+ persons. Suppressing VL benefits communities by reducing transmission to others. Mere availability of ART and care however is insufficient; the benefits of ART depend upon HIV+ persons' continuous visits to the health care provider regular monitoring and regular delivery of medications - known as retention in HIV care. In spite of national efforts up to a quarter of HIV+ persons especially low-income minorities are out of care. Innovative interventions are therefore urgently needed to maximize engagement and retention in HIV care self-reported adherence as well as HIV-1 RNA viral load suppression. In pursuit of these aims the proposed study will assess outcomes of the following interventions in comparison to usual care: 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA) which the investigators hypothesize to be most effective in improving HIV clinical outcomes.    ,NCT02310893

HIV,Safety and Immunogenicity Study of a DNA Vaccine Combined With Protein Vaccine Against HIV/AIDS, The primary objective of the proposed phase I trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAX®B/E combination regimen. Though both DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAX®B/E and the combination of the two vaccines have been evaluated in humans and have shown to be safe and well tolerated this is the first time the combination regimen is being evaluated in HIV-1 uninfected African populations with and without S. mansoni. The secondary objective of the trial is to evaluate the effect of S. mansoni infection on the immunogenicity of the combination of DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine regimen. Successful vaccination against most viruses requires efficient Th1 response. There is evidence that helminth infections skew the host immune system of human and animals to T-helper type 2 (Th2) and induce immunosuppression. Therefore there is a potential that helminth infected populations may not generate the desired immune responses to vaccines designed to drive Th1-type and cytotoxic T-cell responses. Furthermore the influence of helminth infections on the development of protective antibody responses remains unclear. Limited data in animal models suggests that worm infections reduced efficacy of vaccines. The proposed vaccine trial will generate safety tolerability and immunogenicity data of a vaccination regimen with simultaneous administration of a candidate HIV DNA vaccine (DNA-HIV-PT123) and a gp120 protein vaccine (AIDSVAX®B/E). This will be the first HIV vaccine trial to prospectively evaluate the impact of the S. mansoni infection on safety and immune responses to HIV vaccines.    ,NCT02376582
HIV,Collaborative Care for the Detection and Management of Depression Among Adults Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy in South Africa, With increasing access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa HIV has transitioned from a terminal illness to a long-term condition. It is likely to be accompanied by higher levels of disability and other chronic non-communicable diseases resulting from the HIV itself as well as adverse effects of medication. This requires an expansion of the purview of HIV care beyond direct HIV clinical care to also include a more comprehensive and integrated package of treatment and care for physical and mental conditions and their consequences. COBALT is a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) in public sector primary care clinics in the North West Province of SA. It will assess mental health and HIV outcomes for depressed adults receiving ART by measuring the real-world effectiveness of a facility-based stepped care intervention combining depression case detection by non-physician clinicians with group counselling intervention delivered by lay-health workers.    ,NCT02407691
HIV,Hybrid STTR Intervention for Heterosexuals: Anonymous Testing and Confidential Care Linkage," The Brooklyn Community United (BCU) study is a supplement to the main research study titled ""Peer Driven Intervention to Seek Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV."" The main study's field name is Brooklyn Community Action Project (BCAP) (R01DA032083 R#: 11-01257). The main study is testing two approaches to seeking out undiagnosed HIV infection (Venue-based Sampling (VBS) and Confidential Two-Session Testing with Navigation (CTTN-RDS)). HIV prevalence rates in two previous heterosexual cycles of NHBS in the local area are: 7% in HET1 and 12.3% in HET2. The main study BCAP found lower prevalence rates of 3.45% 35.14% of which were newly diagnosed in the RDS-CTTN sample and 1.89% newly diagnosed with HIV in the VBS sample. The primary aim of the Brooklyn Community United (BCU) study is to seek out individuals with undiagnosed HIV using a streamlined RDS-CTTN approach and anonymous HIV Testing in Central Brooklyn. The supplement study hypotheses are: (H1): Compared with VBS and RDS-CTTN and controlling for potential differences on key socio-demographic characteristics across the samples RDS-ASTN participants will have less HIV testing experience. (H2) Controlling for potential differences on key socio-demographic characteristics across the samples RDS-ASTN will yield higher rates previously undiagnosed HIV compared with VBS and RDS-CTTN. (H3): Most participants (> 70%) found to be HIV-infected in the RDS-ASTN intervention will engage in the Treat and Retain intervention phase. (H4): Most participants in the Treat and Retain phase of the RDS-ASTN intervention (> 70%) all of whom will be HIV infected will be linked to care within 3 months.    ",NCT02421159

HIV,Demonstration Project of PrEP Among Female Sex Workers in Dakar Senegal," Recent breakthroughs in antiretroviral (ARV)-based prevention provide new opportunities to rethink HIV prevention and treatment strategies especially for key populations such as Female Sex Workers (FSWs). Antiretroviral (ARV)-based prevention of HIV transmission has the potential to have a profound population-level impact on the course of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Several recently completed randomized controlled trials of HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) have shown efficacy at reducing HIV acquisition in high-risk populations. How to translate these trial results into population-level effects is the next critical step. PrEP ""demonstration"" projects in collaboration with local stakeholders and at sites of routine care for high-risk populations provide an opportunity to move promising research results into actual public health benefits. With these key features in mind the investigators propose a HIV PrEP demonstration project in FSW in Dakar Senegal West Africa. The objective of the proposed demonstration project with Tenofovir DF/Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) among Female Sex Workers (FSW) in Dakar Senegal is to build a sustainable HIV PrEP program for FSW in Dakar Senegal while demonstrating the feasibility of providing daily oral PrEP with Truvada (TDF/FTC) for 12 months to the enrolled FSW at Ministry of Heath run clinics (IHS and Pikine Mbao Rufisque and Diamniadio Health Centers). Critical milestones for this demonstration project with be feasibility uptake acceptability use of TDF/FTC PrEP and programmatic retention of FSWs in Dakar MoH clinics. The investigators have assembled an expert team from RARSThe University of Washington and Westat that have had greater than 2 decades of collaboration on HIV related projects in FSWs in Senegal. The investigators expect the results of this project will show that Senegal provides a unique opportunity to assess acceptability feasibility uptake and effectiveness of oral HIV PrEP at reducing HIV transmission in a high-risk FSW population.

HIV,Demand Creation for Couples' HIV Counseling and Testing, This study aims at assessing the effect of a demand-creation intervention on couples' HIV counseling and testing (couples' HCT) uptake among married couples who have never tested together as a couple. The study is being implemented in 12 clusters; six intervention and six comparison clusters. A total of 1538 couples will be enrolled into the study; 769 couples per arm. Couples in the intervention communities are invited to participate in small group couple-focused or men-only interactive sessions lasting 3-4 hours in which the advantages and fears associated with couples' HCT are discussed with invited couples to motivate them to consider testing together as a couple. The meetings are reinforced with testimonies from previously tested couples. At the end of the sessions couples or men receive invitation coupons which they present to a designated health facility to receive couples' HCT services (couples are free to receive individual HCT or not to honor the invitation if they are not interested in taking the HCT offer). In the comparison communities standard of care health education activities including general adult community sessions are held but couples do not receive any invitations to test as a couple. Nevertheless couples in the comparison communities have unlimited access to HIV counseling and testing services that are offered by the Rakai Health Sciences Program within the study communities. The investigators hypothesize that couples in the intervention arm will be more likely to test together than those in the comparison arm. The study objectives include: a) exploring the motivations for and barriers to couples' HCT uptake; b) assessing the effect of a demand-creation intervention on couples' HCT uptake among married couples with no prior couples' HCT experience and c) exploring the effect of couples' HCT vs. individual HCT on linkage to and retention in HIV care.    ,NCT02492061

HIV,Acceptance and Compassion to Enhance Self-care Pilot, Innovative approaches are needed to optimize the benefits of treatment as prevention (TasP) among HIV+ substance users who experience profound health disparities that amplify onward transmission risk. This project will systematically develop refine and conduct an open pilot to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a two-phase emotion regulation intervention that targets emotional barriers to HIV-related self-care among individuals who endorse active substance use. Emotional barriers such as shame and internalized stigma have been identified as barriers to optimal HIV care among individuals struggling with HIV and substance use. To effectively implement TasP strategies for addressing these barriers are needed. Utilizing transdiagnostic approaches (e.g. positive affect-focused emotional regulation mindfulness and self-compassion) investigators will develop refine and pilot a two-phase emotional regulation intervention that requires only 5 face-to-face hours and can ultimately be implemented by a case-management-level staff person or trained peer educator. The first phase of the intervention will be a multicomponent in-person intervention targeting emotional cognitive and behavioral barriers to HIV self-care behaviors among HIV+ substance users. The second phase of the intervention will extend the intervention benefits by sending personalized positive self-reappraisal text messages in response to text message queries about participants' mood. This phase will use an innovative personalized bi-directional platform which will leverage an existing text message delivery system. This project will be instrumental in developing a relatively low-resource intervention strategy to address unmet emotional barriers to optimal HIV-care among individuals who are actively using substances. This work will provide the necessary pilot data for a subsequent grant submission to assess the preliminary efficacy of the intervention. The resulting intervention has the potential to address emotional barriers to self-care along the HIV care cascade: including retention in care antiretroviral treatment adherence and persistence and ultimately viral suppression.    ,NCT02535455

HIV,Measuring and Monitoring Adherence to ART With Pill Ingestible Sensor System, Introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV-infection from a fatal to manageable disease but adherence to ART remains critical to optimize outcomes. Existing measures of ART adherence provide only inferred measures of actual drug intake and most offer no real-time notification capability. Directly observed therapy measures actual drug intake but is not practical. These limitations constrain research into medication adherence and more importantly limit our ability to develop real-time interventions based on feasible in vivo monitoring of adherence among HIV-infected people to facilitate medication-taking. The Proteus digital health feedback (PDHF) system a pill ingestible sensor based adherence measuring and monitoring system developed by Proteus Digital Health addresses these limitations. It involves use of an ingestible sensor a tiny edible material that is over-encapsulated along with prescribed medication. The sensor is activated by ingestion and is sensed by a patch worn by the patient with an embedded monitor and sensor. The monitor sends a Bluetooth signal to a mobile device which in turn sends an encrypted message to a central server thus effecting real-time monitoring that a dose has been taken. The investigators propose to develop a data receiving hub and add to these components an automated text message that is sent to the patient when a dose is missed. The investigators will evaluate the feasibility acceptability and sustainability of using the PDHF system; assess the accuracy of the PDHF system in measuring adherence to ART; and evaluate the efficacy of the PDHF system for monitoring and leveraging adherence to ART.    ,NCT02797262

HIV,Long Term Outcomes of Therapy in Women Initiated on Lifelong ART Because of Pregnancy in DR Congo, Despite the rapid adoption of the World Health Organization's 2013 guidelines many children continue to be infected with HIV perinatally because of sub-optimal adherence to the continuum of HIV care in maternal and child health clinics (MCH). To achieve the UNAIDS goal eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission multiple adaptive interventions will need to be implemented to improve adherence to the HIV continuum. The aim of this open label parallel groups randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) interventions implemented at facility and health district level to improve retention in care and virological suppression through 24 months postpartum among pregnant and breastfeeding women receiving ART in MCH clinics in Kinshasa Democratic Republic of Congo. Prior to randomization the current monitoring and evaluation system will be strengthen to enable collection of high quality individual patient-level data necessary for the timely production of indicators and monitoring of program outcomes to inform CQI interventions. Following randomization in health districts randomized to CQI quality improvement (QI) teams will be established at the district level and at MCH clinics level. For 18 months QI teams will be brought together quarterly to identified key bottlenecks in the care delivery system using data from the monitoring system develop an action plan to address those bottlenecks and implement the action plan at the level of their district or clinics. If proven to be effective CQI as designed here could be scaled up rapidly in DRC and other resource-limited settings to accelerate progress towards the goal of an AIDS free generation.    ,NCT03048669
HIV,A Couple-based HIV Prevention Intervention to Promote HIV Protection Among Latino Male Couples, Epidemiological studies have attributed the source of many new HIV and STI infections among MSM to primary partners. Despite recent emphasis on couples-based interventions efficacious interventions for Latino male couples have yet to be tested. The proposed study builds on the PI's post-doctoral research in which he adapted evidence based intervention for Black MSM couples Connect `n Unite for Latino male couples using methodologically rigorous adaptation procedures. The adapted intervention Conectado Latinos en Parejas (CLP) expands the prevention alternatives offered in previous interventions by incorporating biomedical prevention methods such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) promoting engagement in care adherence to treatment regimens and viral suppression (TasP) and encouraging routine HIV testing if appropriate given the couple's serostatus. The investigators will conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) to examine whether participants assigned to CLP report an increase in the proportion of HIV protected anal sex acts (operationalized as using condoms PrEP TasP) compared to those assigned to a Wellness Promotion (WP) time matched attention control. The investigators will recruit 150 Latino male couples from the Philadelphia MSA and randomly assign them to CLP or WP. Participants will complete ACASIs to assess behavioral and psychosocial factors and be tested for sexually transmitted infections (STI) at baseline 3 and 6 month post intervention. The investigators will conduct optional HIV/STI testing at baseline 3 and 6 month post intervention. The primary study activities will be conducted at a large Latino serving CBO in North Philadelphia. To our knowledge this study will be the first to examine the impact of a couple-based intervention to increase HIV protected anal sex acts for Latino male couples capable of being scaled up and replicated in various communities to provide continuous support and protection for this heavily impacted group.    ,NCT03048838
HIV,Pediatric Decentralization of ART in South Africa, The decentralization study will describe children taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) at a larger health facility in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa between the years of 2004-2013. The study will be conducted at Dora Nginza Hospital (DNH). The study will measure how many children stay in care and how many die as well as their health status. The study will also compare whether children do better if they stay in care a large hospitals or if they get health care at smaller clinics. A second part of the study will find children in the community who have stopped coming for health care and find out what happened to them and what their health status is.    ,NCT03049891
HIV,A Mobile Phone Game to Prevent HIV Among Young Africans, This project will test the feasibility of an electronic game to prevent HIV among African preadolescents delivered via inexpensive Android smart phones. In order to collect feasibility data for a future randomized controlled trial this study involves the pilot-testing of the intervention with a sample of young people in Nyanza region Kenya where 11.4% of young women ages 15-24 are HIV-infected. This feasibility study will be carried out with the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI).    ,NCT03054051
HIV,A Randomized Pilot Trial Evaluating the Impact of a Yoga Intervention on Cognition in Older Adults Infected With HIV, Approximately 50% of people living with HIV (and as many as 80% over the age of 50) have difficulties with cognitive functions such as memory and thinking that can have a profound negative impact on activities of daily living and quality of life. Problems with memory and thinking are also associated with forgetting to take anti-retroviral drugs and experiencing challenges to balance walking and mental health (anxiety and depression). There is increasing evidence that in the general population exercise has positive effects on cognition physical functioning and mental health. Despite the recognition of multiple therapeutic benefits of exercise little attention has been paid to its possible effects on cognition in people living with HIV. The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to compare the effects of a 12-week randomly assigned community-based yoga-mindfulness intervention on cognition balance walking mental health and quality of life in 30 people >45 years of age living with HIV in the Halifax area. Yoga is of particular interest because it encompasses not only the physical but also spiritual emotional and mental dimensions of life. As such it has tremendous potential to help stave off some of the devastating consequences of HIV infection.    ,NCT03071562
HIV,Traditional Healers as Adherence Partners for Persons Living With HIV in Rural Mozambique, The overall goal of this project is to adapt and assess the impact of a traditional healer training program/intervention on the adherence retention and viral load of HIV infected patients newly initiated on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in rural Mozambique.    ,NCT03076359
HIV,YouthPower Action Feasibility Study of Online Support Group Intervention Among Adolescents Living With HIV in Nigeria, This study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention designed to improve retention in HIV care services and improve anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence among adolescents ages 15-19 years living with HIV enrolled in ART services.    ,NCT03076996
HIV,Improving Engagement in HIV Care for High-risk Women, Transgender women (assigned 'male' at birth but who do not identify as male) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and have culturally unique barriers and facilitators to engagement in HIV care. Transgender women living with HIV (TWH) are less likely than others to take antiretroviral therapy (ART) and those who initiate ART have lower rates of ART adherence lower self-efficacy for integrating ART into daily routines and report fewer positive interactions with health care providers than non-transgender adults. As a result TWH have an almost three-fold higher viral load than non-transgender adults in San Francisco; in Los Angeles TWH are less likely to be virally suppressed than any other behavioral risk group. In formative work the investigators have identified culturally-specific and modifiable barriers to HIV treatment engagement among TWH including prioritization of transition-related health care (i.e. hormone therapy) at the expense of HIV treatment avoidance of HIV care settings due to past negative health care experiences misinformation about ART including potential drug interactions with hormones intensified HIV stigma low levels of social support and poor coping skills. There are both individual and public health consequences to poor engagement in care among TWH stemming from high transmission risk factors including substance abuse high numbers of sex partners engagement in sex work and high rates of mental illness. These findings strongly suggest that TWH face unique challenges to engaging in and adhering to HIV treatment and that the public health consequences for poor engagement in this population are of grave concern. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to engagement in care are critical in efforts to alter the pattern of HIV-related disparities that lead to disproportionately poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable and marginalized population. The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial of a theory-driven population-specific piloted intervention to improve engagement in care for TWH. Grounded in the investigators' Models of Gender Affirmation and Health Care Empowerment the proposed research is the first to systematically intervene on complex barriers to optimal engagement in HIV care for TWH. The investigators have developed and piloted the Healthy Divas intervention to optimize engagement in HIV care for TWH at elevated risk for treatment failure and consequential morbidity mortality and transmission of HIV.    ,NCT03081559
HIV,"""Switch Either at Suppression Or THOusand""", This trial addresses the question of the viral load (VL) threshold for switching from first-line to second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). The WHO currently sets the threshold at 1000 copies/mL. However the optimal threshold for defining virological failure and the need to switch ART regimen has not been determined. In fact people with VL levels of less than 1000 copies/mL however not fully suppressed are at increased risk for drug resistance mutations (DRM) and subsequent virological failure. In resource-limited settings where VL monitoring is not as frequent as in high-income countries this could have serious implications and patients may continue on a failing regimen for a long period. Our research consortium will conduct a multi-center parallel-group open-label randomized clinical trial in a resource-limited setting to assess whether a threshold of 100 copies/mL compared to the WHO-defined threshold of 1000 copies/mL for switching to second-line ART among unsuppressed HIV-positive patients on first-line ART will lead to better outcomes.    ,NCT03088241
HIV,Neuropsychological Outcomes of Internationally-Adopted Children Who Are Perinatally-Infected With Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Children who are perinatally-infected with HIV are extremely vulnerable to cognitive delays and psychiatric disease and the risk for neuropsychiatric illness is compounded in children who are internationally-adopted and may have suffered trauma abandonment malnutrition and neglect. While cognitive and psychiatric issues have been described in HIV-infected children and even more so in HIV-positive adults there have been no reports on neuropsychiatric interventions that can improve cognitive and psychiatric states in this highly vulnerable population. Without these needed data Pediatric HIV providers have not been able to advocate for optimal neuropsychiatric care in perinatally HIV-infected children let alone those who has suffered the additional risk of being internationally adopted. In the proposed study the investigators will report on the neuropsychological profiles and outcomes in a cohort of internationally-adopted perinatally HIV-infected children between ages 6 to 16 years who have not previously undergone neuropsychological testing or treatment. Data obtained from this study will provide important contributions to the literature by building understanding of the complex needs of this population as well as guiding future intervention efforts. The investigators predict that intervention efforts aimed at helping educators understand the learning and cognitive challenges for many of our patients will guide targeted academic supports in the school setting and lead to gains in academic skills. The detailed information obtained during the comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and follow-up care will be shared with the child's key educators at school so that individualized educational strategies can be developed while maintaining confidentiality regarding the child's HIV status.    ,NCT03100331

HIV,Evaluating the Impact of a Community Health Worker Program in Neno Malawi, This protocol concerns the implementation and evaluation of an intervention designed to realign the existing cadre of Community Health Workers (CHW) in Neno District Malawi to better support the care needs of the clients they serve. The proposed intervention is a 'Household Model' where CHWs will be assigned to households rather than HIV or TB specific patients and will be trained to provide support for a wider range of conditions including HIV hypertension diabetes and pediatric malnutrition. The new model is designed to improve retention in care for clients with chronic non-communicable diseases along with increased uptake of women's health services and treatment for pediatric malnutrition while sustaining the high retention rates for clients in the HIV program. Eleven sites (health centres and hospitals) were arranged into six clusters by estimated size of the catchment area populations with a population range of 11680 to 26260 and an average population of 20400. The order in which the intervention will be rolled out across the sites will be randomized so that the intervention can be evaluated in a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. These clusters were grouped based mostly on geographic location but also on catchment area sizes in order to maximize feasibility of training for the CHW team and not overload CHW training sessions with too many trainees.    ,NCT03106727
HIV,Strategies for the Prevention of Hepatitis B Among HIV Infected Patients in Uganda, The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two vaccination strategies against Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in subjects already infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Researchers plan to determine the optimal vaccination strategy for achieving protective immunity to HBV infection in HIV-infected adults attending Mulago Hospital's HIV care clinic. Primary objectives are to assess:   1. The role of CD4-cell count and HIV viral loads on the HBV vaccine response.   2. The role of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the HBV vaccine response. The secondary objective is to evaluate whether lack of HAART is associated with high rates of loss to follow-up.    ,NCT02316444
HIV,Evaluating a Microfinance Intervention for Vulnerable Women in Kazakhstan, This study will examine the efficacy of a combined HIV and microfinance intervention to reduce biologically confirmed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and new incidence of HIV and HCV as well as reported sexual and drug risk behaviors among 520 women who have injected drugs in the past year and who engage in sex trading in Temirtau and Pavlodar Kazakhstan. The proposed study builds on findings from an R34 by the investigative team testing a combination HIV prevention and microfinance intervention. Building on successful protocols and significant results we will randomly assign 520 women who inject drugs and engage in sex trading from Temirtau and Pavlodar Kazakhstan to either (1) a 4 session HIV prevention intervention combined with a 6 session financial literacy intervention enrollment in an existing vocational training program and receipt of matched savings (HIVRR+MF); or to the 4 session HIV prevention intervention alone. The HIVRR intervention is guided by social cognitive theory. The HIVRR+MF intervention integrates asset theory with social cognitive theory. The MF includes: 1) financial literacy; 2) vocational training; and 3) micro-savings to support transition to a more permanent employment status. We hypothesize that increasing financial literacy enhancing vocational skills required to fill marketable positions in the local economy and beginning a personal savings program combined with HIV risk reduction will lead to significant reductions in study outcomes compared to an HIVRR intervention without a microfinance intervention.    ,NCT02406482

All the included children will be followed up and their development and infection status will be recorded and compared.    ,NCT02712801
HIV,Puerto Rico Cuidalos Parent-adolescent Program," Latino adolescents are at high risk for HIV/AIDS other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies. Puerto Rican adolescents in particular experience disparities in these areas yet few adolescent and even fewer parent interventions have been developed to address these important issues with this underserved population. Parent-adolescent programs are an effective approach to reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior and associated negative consequences. A web-based parent communication intervention provides an opportunity to strengthen and enhance programs that are designed for adolescents by providing additional support for safer sex decisions and to increase parents' access to sexual health education programs by decreasing barriers that keep them from participating in these interventions (e.g. low cost can be viewed privately at parents convenience minimizes competing time with work and family). The purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate a brief theoretically informed (i.e. Ecodevelopmental Theory Theory of Reasoned Action/Planned Behavior Social Cognitive Theory 1-6) culturally appropriate and linguistically tailored web-based parental communication program Cuídalos (""Take care of them"") designed to improve parent-adolescent sexual communication and reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior. Recent findings from an NIH funded R21 randomized control trial (RCT) testing a brief computer-based version of the Cuídalos program indicated that the program increased parent-adolescent general communication and sexual risk communication with English and Spanish speaking U.S. Latinos. Further despite limited or no previous computer use parents reported they liked and learned from the program and that it was easy to use and accessible.    ",NCT03063385

HIV,Adherence to HIV Therapy in Heroin Addicts: Oral vs. Extended Release Naltrexone, Substance use particularly the compulsive behaviors associated with addiction lead to unhealthy behaviors including non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and treatment failure. High on the list of disorders leading to non-adherence is heroin addiction as a wide range of impulsive high-risk behaviors accompanies it. The science of adherence would be improved by developing new methods to prevent relapse to heroin addiction especially methods that can be used in settings that are not limited by the aims to test such a method using an implantable naltrexone formulation (IN) that is approved in Russia and blocks opioid effects for 3 months. The efficacy of the IN should be better than oral naltrexone (ON) because it does not depend on daily behavior to take a tablet and maintains a constant plasma level for months which should result in sustained blockade less relapse and better ART adherence and treatment response.    ,NCT02046252
HIV,Cell Phone Technology Targeting ART and Naltrexone Adherence and Alcohol Use, The proposed study for HIV positive alcohol dependent adults currently taking naltrexone is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the outcomes of a 12-week behavioral support program delivered via text-messaging. It is expected that the text messaging intervention will reduce alcohol use and HIV-risk behaviors. The investigators also hypothesize that the intervention will improve adherence to HIV treatment and naltrexone. To test the effects of the intervention on these target outcomes 25 participants receiving the text messaging intervention will be compared to 25 participants receiving an informational pamphlet. The pamphlet will contain information about the importance of HIV treatment adherence reducing HIV risk behaviors and health consequences associated with alcohol use. By providing support to maximize HIV treatment regimen and naltrexone adherence coupled with coping skills to promote abstinence from alcohol the text messaging intervention may provide a promising cost-effective and easily deployable behavioral support program for alcohol users who are HIV-infected.    ,NCT02603471

HIV,Trial of Maraviroc (UK-427857) in Combination With Zidovudine/Lamivudine Versus Efavirenz in Combination With Zidovudine/Lamivudine, Maraviroc (UK-427857) a selective and reversible CCR5 coreceptor antagonist has been shown to be active in vitro against a wide range of clinical isolates (including those resistant to existing classes). In HIV-1 infected patients maraviroc (UK-427857) given as monotherapy for 10 days reduced HIV-1 viral load by up to 1.6 log consistent with currently available agents. Safety and toleration have been studied in over 400 subjects for up to 28 days at 300 mg twice daily. No significant effects were seen on the QTc interval. The goal of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of maraviroc (UK-427857) versus efavirenz when each are combined with two other antiretroviral agents in patients who are previously naive to antiretroviral therapy. This study will involve approximately 200 centers from around the world to achieve a total randomized subject population of 1071 subjects. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: maraviroc (UK-427857) 300 mg once daily added to zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily) Maraviroc (UK-427857) 300 mg twice daily added to zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily) or efavirenz (600 mg once daily) added to zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily). The study will enroll over approximately an 18 month period (5 months Phase 2b run-in 13 months Phase 3) with 96 weeks of treatment.

It is divided into two stages as follows: Stage I All women registered in the pregnancy clinics at the Namakkal District Hospital or the Rasipuram Government Hospital in the state of Tamil Nadu in India will be offered participation in an educational session on HIV infection and transmission. It will include a pre-educational assessment of knowledge attitudes and beliefs and a post-educational assessment of knowledge about HIV infection and transmission. All women at the clinic regardless of whether or not they participate in the educational and assessment sessions will be offered HIV counseling and testing. The objectives of this stage of the study are to:   -  Assess the acceptance of education about HIV infection and transmission among pregnant women at the participating sites and their knowledge attitudes and beliefs about HIV   -  Assess the acceptance of voluntary counseling and HIV testing among pregnant women at these sites   -  Determine the prevalence of infection among women who accept HIV testing at these sites Stage II Pregnant HIV-infected women at the pregnancy clinics at the Namakkal District Hospital or the Rasipuram Government Hospital who are 18 years of age or older will be offered enrollment in Stage II of this study. Participants will be followed during their pregnancy and until their baby is a year old. The baby will be a part of the study from birth to one year of age. After delivery both the mother and baby will be followed with regularly scheduled visits that include a physical examination and blood test. Treatment with the anti-AIDS drug zidovudine will be offered for both the mother and child. For the study protocol the mother will receive the drug starting the 28th week of pregnancy and continuing through labor and delivery. The infants will start drug treatment within the first 24 hours of life and continue for 6 weeks. Women who do not choose to take zidovudine according to this schedule will be offered standard treatment with a shorter course of drug beginning with the 36th week of pregnancy and no preventative treatment for their infants. All women will be offered education and counseling about the risks and benefits of breastfeeding and the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding. The objectives of this stage of the study are to:   -  Assess the safety and tolerability of zidovudine given according to this protocol   -  Assess the acceptance of and adherence to the zidovudine regimen in the protocol   -  Assess the acceptance of education and counseling about breastfeeding   -  Determine the mother-to-child HIV transmission rates in this study   -  Determine the rates of illness and death through 12 months after delivery   -  Determine risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HIV    ,NCT00341796

HIV,Effect Of A CCR5 Coreceptor Antagonist On The Latency And Reservoir Of HIV-1, The presence of a pool of cells latently infected by HIV-1 in patients taking HAART and with a viral load below 50 copies/mL is the main limitation to eradication of the virus from the body. This viral reservoir prevents antiretroviral therapy from being interrupted; therefore patients are obliged to continue with treatment for a period calculated to be greater than 60 years. Despite the important advances in knowledge of the biology of this reservoir we still have no real knowledge about its dynamics. The opportunity to carry out a clinical trial for the first time with CCR5 coreceptor antagonists is exceptional since the results could provide important information on the nature of this reservoir. If maintenance of the reservoir is a dynamic process inclusion of CCR5 inhibitors is expected to lead to a reduction in the size of this reservoir. This effect could be critical when including IAT (viral reactivation) since in theory it would be necessary to act on a smaller reservoir. Current consensus is that it would be necessary to act on almost 100% of the viral reservoir (approximately 1000000 cells). The study has also been designed to enable us to understand the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which certain drugs can induce viral reactivation in vitro as a previous step to a clinical trial aimed at reactivating viral latency and eradicating HIV-1 from the body.    ,NCT00795444

HIV,Dermal HIV-1 Immunization During Anti-retroviral Therapy Followed by Repeated Treatment Interruptions, In this study the investigators evaluated a therapeutic HIV-1 DNA vaccine administered with a novel topical application method to 12 chronically HIV-infected cART treated patients. The HIV DNA plasmids used in this study encode for envelope gp160 of HIV-1 subtypes A B and C rev B Gag A and B and reverse transcriptase (RT) B. The patients were randomly assigned to three groups; group 1 (n=4) were immunized six times with 0.4 mg of HIV DNA plasmids topically group 2 (n=4) were immunized six times with 0.4 mg of HIV DNA plasmids topically and treated with 500 mg of hydroxyurea daily until visit 10 group 3 (n=4) four patients received placebo. The immunization was performed during three cycles of 7 weeks of cART followed by four weeks of therapy interruption. After the last cycle of cART the patients were maintained on a definitive treatment interruption until CD4+ T cell counts dropped below 350/ mm3 at two time points. Cellular and humoral immune responses viral load and CD4+ T a cell count was analysed throughout the study.    ,NCT01140139
HIV,Impact of Raltegravir on HIV-1 cDNA Slope Following Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Initiation, Recent clinical trials of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) containing the first approved integrase inhibitor (i.e. raltegravir) have demonstrated a more rapid decay of HIV-1 RNA in plasma compared to conventional potent antiretroviral combinations. This was observed especially during the early phase (up to week 12) following initiation of cART. To explain this two mechanistic hypotheses have been developed:   1. - Macrophage reservoir death hypothesis. A major source of virus production during the second phase decay are believed to be long-lived infected cells with continuous virus production - e.g. macrophages. An accumulation of unintegrated episomal HIV-1 cDNAs can promote apoptosis (Li et al. Embo J. 2001;20: 3272). In case of HIV superinfection of such a productively infected cell an INI-based cART may induce apoptosis and thus contribute to a decrease in HIV RNA load during second phase decay. However no study has thus far addressed the consequences of INI treatment on HIV-1 cDNA species on any cell population in vivo.   2. - Resting CD4 T-cell reservoir integration block hypothesis. Resting CD4 T-cells may represent a substantial reservoir for HIV replication during the second phase decay as well. A special characteristic of these cells is that HIV-1 cDNA is typically localized to the nucleus in a not-integrated form (Chun et al. PNAS 1997;94:13193). These resting cells likely integrate HIV-DNA upon activation and then contribute to HIV viremia and viral spread. Conceptually integration could be prevented by RGV but not by RTI or PI. An accumulation of circular episomal HIV-1 cDNA species may also be a consequence of RGV treatment in this cell type. Patient disposition: To explore raltegravir-induced shifts in HIV-1 cDNA species in vivo this non-interventional clinical observation investigates the dynamics of the three major HIV-1 cDNA species (total HIV-1 cDNA HIV-1 integrants in the host cell genome episomal HIV-1 2-LTR circles) over a period of 4 months in two groups of patients starting off cART from a single study center. Patients who begin cART in regular clinical routine with 2N(t)RTI plus either (n=10 patients) raltegravir or (n=10 patients) a boosted protease inhibitor/ alternatively an NNRTI will be offered to participate in this observation. Only patients are offered to participate in this trial if no other antiretroviral drugs than the above mentioned and no concomitant drugs with relevant impact on antiretroviral's pharmacokinetics are administered. At time of study inclusion patients should be characterised by a HIV-1 RNA load of >5000 copies/mL and CD4-cell count of >200/µL within 12 weeks before cART initiation. Preliminary analyses of PBMCs from HIV-infected patients indicate that all three major HIV-1 cDNA species can be quantified by real-time PCR under these baseline conditions.    ,NCT01168167
HIV,Intrauterine Insemination In HIV-Discordant Couples, This study aims to assess the feasibility of a novel standard of care technique for intrauterine insemination (IUI) in HIV-discordant couples in the United States. This study will involve couples in which the male partner is HIV positive but the female partner is negative. The investigators will institute a protocol similar to those used presently throughout Europe with good success. To date no HIV seroconversions have occurred in over 4000 inseminations performed in HIV serodiscordant couples. All male subjects will be on stable HAART and have undetectable serum viral loads prior to insemination. Semen samples will be subjected to a stringent sperm wash procedure and screened for HIV RNA. Female subjects will be followed post-insemination for seroconversion and pregnancy. Infants will be followed for seroconversion at birth through 4 months of age.    ,NCT01173276

HIV,PI or NNRTI as First-line Treatment of HIV in West Africa - the PIONA Trial, BACKGROUND: Since 1996 the combination of three or more drugs has been the mainstay of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. The most important types of drugs are called nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) Response to treatment is measured as increasing CD4+ cell count and decreasing HIV viral load. A major problem is the development of resistance. NNRTIs are recommended as part of first-line treatment of HIV in Africa but many Africans have a slower NNRTI clearance than Caucasians making them more susceptible for development of resistance in case of treatment interruptions. PIs might therefore be a better option in an African setting with low adherence. AIM: To evaluate two different treatment regimens in HIV-1 infected patients: A) A NNRTI (efavirenz/nevirapine) based regimen and B) A PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir) based regimen with regard to treatment outcomes. HYPOTHESIS: Treatment with a PI will be superior to treatment with a NNRTI due to less development of resistance. METHODS: Treatment-naïve adult HIV-1 patients enrolled in an existing cohort The West African Retrovirus and Acquired Immune Deficiency (WARAID) cohort in Guinea Bissau with CD4+ cell count ??350 cells/µL and/or clinical signs of immune suppression (World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage 3 or 4) will be randomised 1:1 to: Treatment A: 2 NRTIs (lamivudine and either zidovudine or stavudine) and 1 NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine) or Treatment B: 2 NRTIs (same as in treatment A) and 1 PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir). Primary outcome: Viral load suppression <400 copies/ml 12 months after enrolment. PERSPECTIVES: Guidelines for treatment of HIV in Africa are more or less a copy of the guidelines used in Europe and North America. Genetic differences in pharmacokinetics more women infected in Africa and difficulties ensuring good adherence mean that results obtained from Caucasian patients are not directly transferrable to African patients. The results of this study will hopefully help guiding the treatment of HIV in Africa in the future. The investigators believe the HIV infected people in West Africa deserve the same evidence-based medicine as in developed countries.    ,NCT01192035

HIV,Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders in HIV Infected Children and Adolescent, The advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment has resulted in the survival into adolescence of an increasing proportion of infants and children with perinatal HIV infection in Senegal. However the transformation of HIV into a chronic disease needing lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART) raises new challenges among others related to a disturbance of glucose metabolism lipid abnormalities in addition to the potential effects on children's growth and puberty. Little is known on nutritional and metabolic changes in HIV-infected children on ART in Africa while implementation of the latest WHO recommendations should eventually lead to an increase in the number of children on ART in this region. Moreover bio-clinical evolution of untreated children is poorly documented in the African context. It therefore urgently needed to institute a cohort study to evaluate in the long term the impact of HIV infection and/or ART on nutritional and metabolic disorders and to characterize the risk factors of their occurrence in children and adolescents infected as they move through adolescent into adulthood.    ,NCT01771562

HIV,Pioglitazone Before Peginterferon and Ribavirin for Hepatitis C Infection in HIV/HCV-Coinfected Patients With Insulin Resistance, Insulin resistance is common in people coinfected with HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is associated with poor responses to treatment for HCV. Pioglitazone is an FDA-approved medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It works by increasing the body's sensitivity to insulin. The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with pioglitazone prior to HCV treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin is safe and effective in improving the treatment outcome in insulin-resistant HIV/HCV-coinfected people for whom previous treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin was unsuccessful.    ,NCT00665353
HIV,Usage of Acyclovir for Suppression of HIV-1 and HSV-2 Coinfected Persons in Cameroon, The study proposed that both clinical and subclinical HSV reactivation is associated with increased HIV shedding from mucosal surfaces which may increase the infectiousness of HIV-1/HSV-2 coinfected persons. To test this hypothesis we will control HSV reactivation with acyclovir a safe medication that is proven to reduce HSV shedding and measure HIV levels in blood genital and pharyngeal secretions. The study hypothesizes that acyclovir will reduce HIV shedding from mucosal surfaces of HIV-1/HSV-2 coinfected individuals.    ,NCT00209313
HIV,Enhancement by Poly-ICLC During HIV-1 Infection," This study involves researching new approaches to treating HIV infection. Currently HIV infection is treated with combinations of drugs called antiretrovirals. These drugs protect cells from infection by interfering with the viruses' ability to make copies of itself by infecting new target cells. Though these drugs are very effective they cannot cure HIV infection and must be taken each and every day at prescribed doses to maintain their beneficial effect. This research study is investigating a new approach that involves an addition to existing medications. The study is investigating a medication called Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol® Oncovir) which is an adjuvant. Adjuvants are medications that are designed to boost your body's immune responses resulting from a vaccine. The investigators want to test whether Poly-ICLC is an adjuvant that is effective in HIV-infected patients. A vaccine is not given in this study but just investigating the adjuvant Poly-ICLC to determine whether it may be safe and useful in future vaccines that could be used to treat HIV called therapeutic vaccines. One goal of future therapeutic vaccines is to reduce the virus that remains persistently inside of cells in a dormant or resting state despite treatment with HIV medications. This persistent pool is termed the ""latent virus pool"" or ""viral reservoir"". One tactic to reduce this viral reservoir is to first stimulate HIV to start replicating in order to force it out of hiding. Once viral replication occurs the infected cells may then be recognized and killed by cells of the immune system. Therefore we also want to see what effect Poly-ICLC has on the virus that lives inside of cells. Specifically the investigators want to look at whether Poly-ICLC increases the level of virus inside your cells while also improving your immune system's responses. The investigators are doing this research in hope to find new ways to treat HIV infection that may reduce exposure to medications that are called antiretrovirals. Antiretrovirals are medications used to treat HIV infection. They are very effective but have side effects and have to be taken each and every day and cannot cure HIV.    ",NCT02071095

HIV,Study of Protease Inhibitor Regimen Switch in HIV-1 Infected Patients With Undetectable Viral Load to Prove the Non-inferiority of Once Daily Dose Regimen Versus the Current Twice Daily Regimen to Maintain the Viral Load Under the Limit of Detection., Darunavir boosted with ritonavir (darunavir/r) is a powerful protease inhibitor able to reduce the viral load in patients infected with multi-resistant HIV strains; In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the induction of resistance mutations in the protease gene is much more difficult with the association darunavir/r compared to the other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r) testifying of a significantly higher genetic barrier to resistance. Moreover the tolerance to darunavir is good and the pharmacologic profile of this molecule allows a once daily administration with a 800/100 mg dose in patients infected with a wild HIV strain or with a slightly resistant to darunavir/r strain. Thus we propose to evaluate the efficacy of the darunavir/r association once daily as a substitute to a protease inhibitor regimen administered twice daily in patients with undetectable viral load receiving a tritherapy including a protease inhibitor administered twice daily.    ,NCT00849160

HIV,Study of PENNVAX??B (Gag Pol Env) + Electroporation in HIV-1 Infected Adult Participants, DNA vaccines consist of small pieces of DNA also known as plasmids and have several potential advantages over traditional vaccines. Thus far DNA vaccines appear to be well tolerated in humans. We have developed DNA vaccine PENNVAX-B which includes plasmids targeting the gag pol and env proteins of HIV-1. The vaccine will be delivered via electroporation (EP) which uses the CELLECTRA constant current device to deliver a small electric charge following injection since animal studies have shown that this delivery method increases the immune response to vaccine. The vaccine will be given to HIV-1 infected subjects whose viral load is undetectable on a HAART regimen with CD4 lymphocyte count above 400 cells/µL of blood. It is hypothesized that PENNVAX-B + EP will be safe and well tolerated.    ,NCT01082692

HIV,DCVax Plus Poly ICLC in Healthy Volunteers, DCVax-001 is a recombinant protein vaccine designed to prevent and potentially treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The vaccine is composed of a fusion protein containing a human monoclonal antibody specific for the dendritic cell receptor DEC-205 (CD205) and the HIV gag p24 protein. The vaccine is designed to target HIV antigens directly to endocytic pathways in dendritic cells (DCs) that allow for efficient processing and presentation of multiple HIV peptides on both MHC class I and II products which will induce HIV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. This vaccine candidate must be combined with appropriate immunostimulants (adjuvants) to induce immunity to the antigen. In the proposed clinical trial we will use poly ICLC (Hiltonol) from Oncovir Inc as the adjuvant.    ,NCT01127464
HIV,Novel Interventions in HIV-1 Infection, For several years there has been interest in why some people with HIV-1 progress more slowly to disease and have longer survival without Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) than others. The investigators and others have identified a few HIV positive individuals who can control their viral load for many years without HAART these rare individuals do not lose their HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses which are very important for controlling viral load. This group is referred to as long-term non-progressors (LTNP). Unlike LTNP the majority of HIV-1 infected individuals are chronic progressors (CP) who do not make effective HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses even when on HAART. We propose to use a novel DNA vaccine boosted with immune based therapy (cytokines and hormones) to try to regenerate the missing HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses to make chronically infected HIV-1+ persons more like LTNP. By injecting this novel DNA vaccine and immune based therapy into the people who are already infected with HIV-1 the immune system may be stimulated to mount a greater immune response not only to the vaccines but also to real HIV-1 particles and HIV-1-infected cells.    ,NCT01130376

HIV,Effect of Maraviroc (MCV) on the Immunological Recovery of HIV-1 Discordant Patients With CD4 Lymphocyte Counts Below 200 Cells/mm3, Maraviroc is an antiretroviral drug that belongs to the family of the CCR5 coreceptor inhibitors. It has proven to be effective in increasing CD4 lymphocyte counts in both in treated and naïve patients irrespective of the viral load. The investigators hypothesize that adding Maraviroc to the antiretroviral treatment of discordant patients defined as those having CD4 lymphocyte counts below 200 cells /mm3 during the last year could lead to its immunological recovery. 60 patients will be included in this unicentric prospective randomized and stratified clinical trial. They will be randomized to either continue with its usual high activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART) treatment or to receive 300 mg of Maraviroc every 12 hours plus its usual treatment.

HIV,HPV Test-and-Treat-Strategy Versus Cytology-based Strategy for Prevention of CIN2+ in HIV-Infected Women, Women sometimes develop cancer in an area called the cervix which is the opening to the uterus or womb. Women who have HIV are more likely to get this kind of cancer than women who do not have HIV. Nearly all of these cancers are caused by another virus called human papilloma virus (or HPV). Other times the cause of this cancer is not known. The investigators are looking for a better way to prevent cervical cancer. This study is comparing two different methods to prevent cancer of the cervix in women who have HIV. This study will also see if these methods are safe and tolerable in women who have HIV.    ,NCT01315353

Hypotheses:   1. The frequency of resting CD4+ T cell- associated HIV RNA (RCVL) will be increased following single and repeated exposure to VOR when given at appropriate intervals and   2. That repeated exposure to VOR will reduce the frequency of HIV infection within resting CD4+ T cells (RCI)    ,NCT01319383
HIV,Efficacy Safety and Tolerability of Cenicriviroc (CVC) in Combination With Truvada or Sustiva Plus Truvada in HIV 1-infected Antiretroviral Treatment-naïve Adult Patients Infected With Only CCR5-tropic Virus, This is a randomized double-blind double-dummy 48-week comparative study. Approximately 150 HIV-infected treatment-naïve patients with CCR5-tropic virus will be stratified by HIV-1 RNA: ??00000 copies/mL versus <100000 copies/mL and will be randomized 2:2:1 to receive:   -  Arm A: CVC 100 mg (2 tablets 50 mg each) QD + CVC matching placebo (2 tablets) QD + EFV matching placebo (1 tablet) QHS + FTC/TDF (1 tablet) QD.   -  Arm B: CVC 200 mg (4 tablets 50 mg each) QD + EFV matching placebo (1 tablet) QHS + FTC/TDF (1 tablet) QD.   -  Arm C: CVC matching placebo (4 tablets) QD + EFV 600 mg (1 tablet) QHS + FTC/TDF (1 tablet) QD. Doses of both CVC/placebo and EFV/ placebo will be administered as double-blinded study drug. FTC/TDF will be administered as open-label study drug in a fixed-dose combination formulation (Truvada). CVC/placebo should be taken following breakfast; EFV should be taken on an empty stomach at bedtime. HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts percentages and ratios will be measured at every visit. Samples for viral tropism and resistance testing in case of virologic failure will be collected at Screening and each on-treatment visit. Biomarkers associated with inflammation and immune activation will be measured at Baseline (predose) and each study visit thereafter with flow cytometry obtained at weeks 4 12 24 48 and 52. Fasting metabolic indicators of glucose control (glucose and insulin for HOMA-IR HbA1c) and fasting lipid profiles (HDL LDL total cholesterol and triglycerides) will be measured at Baseline (predose) and Weeks 4 12 24 48 and 52. Waist-to-hip ratios will be measured at Baseline and Weeks 24 and 48. Plasma samples will be collected and stored for possible future studies at Baseline (predose) and every visit thereafter.    ,NCT01338883
HIV,Immuno-stimulation With Maraviroc Combined to Antiretroviral Therapy in Advanced Late Diagnosed HIV-1 Infected Patients, The objective of the OPTIMAL study is to demonstrate that the adjunction of Maraviroc to a combination of antiretroviral therapy in naive and late diagnosed HIV-1 infected patients counts may accelerate the kinetics of immune restoration and decrease the risk of disease progression and death. It is a randomized versus placebo double-blind trial conducted in France Spain and Italy.    ,NCT01348308
HIV,Atorvastatin on Biomarkers of Inflammation Coagulopathy Angiogenesis & T-cells, ACTG A5275 was a prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design pilot study evaluating the effect of atorvastatin on biomarkers of inflammation coagulopathy angiogenesis and T-lymphocyte activation in HIV-1 infected individuals with suppressed HIV-1 RNA on stable protease inhibitor based antiretroviral therapy with fasting LDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dL. Atorvastatin is a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating high cholesterol. Atorvastatin has also been able to lower the level of inflammation blood tests in certain other diseases but has not been studied for this purpose in people who have HIV. The main goal of this experimental study is to see how taking atorvastatin affects inflammation blood tests in people infected with HIV who do not need to take medicine for high cholesterol. In addition to observing the effects of atorvastatin on the level of inflammation measured in the blood this study evaluated if atorvastatin is safe for people with HIV who are also taking medication for HIV.    ,NCT01351025
HIV,Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Alone or With Delayed Chemo Versus ART With Immediate Chemo for Limited AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) occurs in persons with HIV infection who are also infected with the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV). Several chemotherapy (anti-cancer) drugs work well in treating KS but there is no treatment that cures KSHV infection. One chemotherapy drug called etoposide (VePesid® ET) has caused KS tumors to get smaller in some people. Antiretroviral therapy (anti-HIV drugs or ART) is a group of medicines taken together to treat HIV infection. These medicines help to stop HIV from growing in the body. When this happens your immune system which fights infection and some cancers like KS will get stronger. For some people limited stage KS often improves or stays the same when they take ART. However in some people KS gets worse when taking ART. These people may need chemotherapy at a later date. This study is being done to find out if taking ART with immediate etoposide (ET) is better than taking ART alone or ART with delayed ET to treat limited stage KS. The study will also try to better understand KSHV and to see what kind of side effects are caused by ART and ET and how safe ART and ET are.    ,NCT01352117
HIV,Study of Options for Second-Line Effective Combination Therapy (SELECT), The study was conducted on people who were taking their first anti-HIV drug regimen (including an Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) a type of anti-HIV drug) but the drugs in this regimen were not doing a good job of fighting their HIV infection. The main purpose of this study was to compare two other anti-HIV drug regimens to see how well they fight HIV. The study also looked at how well participants tolerate the drug regimens and how safe they are. The study was designed to determine whether taking the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus raltegravir (RAL) works as well as what is usually used for second-line therapy: LPV/r plus the best-available nucleoside (nucleotide) reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) combination. Testing a regimen that does not include any NRTIs was important because NRTIs may no longer work for patients who received them as part of their first treatment regimen.    ,NCT01352715
HIV,Study of MK-1972 in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 Infected Participants Who Have Not Previously Received Antiretroviral Therapy (MK-1972-003), This is a two part study to evaluate the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MK-1972 in participants with HIV-1 infections. In Part 1 participants will be randomized to receive MK-1972 (at one of 5 different dose levels given once or twice per day) or placebo. Part II will begin after the results of Part I are known; participants will be randomized to receive MK-1972 (only one dose level twice per day) or placebo. The primary hypotheses are that MK-1972 at the studied doses is safe and well tolerated in HIV-1 infected males; and that MK-1972 has superior antiretroviral activity compared to placebo.    ,NCT01353898
HIV,A Safety and Immunogenicity Study of a Plasmid DNA Prime and MVA Boost Vaccine in HIV-1 Infected Adults on ART, GV-TH-01 is an open label Phase 1 study of 9 HIV-1 infected adults with suppressed viremia who started anti-retroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of a negative HIV antibody test. This study has 3 phases. The first phase is the vaccination phase where patients are vaccinated with pGA2/JS7 (JS7)DNA and MVA62B vaccines on a prime/boost regimen. The second phase of the study is a treatment interruption phase whereby ART is interrupted for a 12 week period approximately 8 weeks following the last vaccination. The third phase occurs after the 12 week treatment interruption phase and is called the treatment reinstitution phase because subjects reinstitute ART and are followed for an additional 24 weeks. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of the vaccines during the three phases of the study. A secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccines during the vaccination phase of the study.    ,NCT01378156
HIV,Bone Immunologic and Virologic Effects of a Antiretroviral Regimen, The main purpose of this study was to compare the effects on bones of the following two drug combinations:   -  maraviroc (MVC) emtricitabine (FTC) plus darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r)   -  tenofovir (TDF) plus emtricitabine (FTC) plus darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) Additional study objectives were the following:   -  To see how the drug combinations affect the brain and kidneys.   -  To see how well the drug combinations lower the HIV viral load.   -  To see how safe the drug combinations are how well people are able to take the study drug combinations and how well their immune systems respond to the study drugs.    ,NCT01400412
HIV,High Dose Vitamin D and Calcium for Bone Health in Individuals Initiating HAART, This study was done with people who were infected with HIV and needed to start treatment for their HIV disease. The purpose of this study is to see if taking vitamin D and calcium will help prevent the bone loss that sometimes happens when people start HIV treatment. For this study the following HIV treatment (or HAART) were provided in the form of a single tablet that contains three different drugs: efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (EFV/FTC/TDF). These drugs are approved by the FDA to treat HIV infection. The HIV treatment provided is common for people who are taking HIV drugs for the first time. The risks seen with this HIV treatment are the same that you would encounter when taking these drugs outside of the study. The lists of risks of this HIV treatment are included in this document because the drugs are provided by the study not because the drugs are being tested. The purpose of the study is only to look at the impact of high doses of vitamin D and calcium in preventing bone loss. There are no study objectives related to HIV treatment (EFV/FTC/TDF).    ,NCT01403051
HIV,Endothelial Function Lipoproteins and Inflammation With Low HDL Cholesterol in HIV: ER Niacin Versus Fenofibrate," This study is being done with people with HIV infection who have low levels of HDL-C. HDL-C is a type of ""good"" cholesterol. People with low HDL-C have a higher risk of heart disease and may have problems with how their blood vessels relax. The endothelium is the inner lining of all blood vessels such as arteries and veins. When the endothelium is not working properly the blood vessels have trouble expanding properly which contributes to the development of heart and blood vessel disease. The main purpose of this study is to see if taking either extended-release niacin or fenofibrate for 24 weeks will help blood vessels work better by improving endothelial function and increasing HDL-C. Niacin and fenofibrate are medications that raise HDL-C. This study will also help determine how safe extended-release niacin and fenofibrate are. The analysis is an as-treated analysis of participants who completed study treatment and had a week 24 BART scan. Safety analyses include all participants    ",NCT01426438
HIV,Gentian Violet Vs. Nystatin Oral Suspension for Treatment of Oropharyngeal Candidiasis, The purpose of this study was to see which one of two medicines (topical gentian violet [GV] or nystatin oral suspension) was better than the other in treating Oral Candidiasis (OC). This was measured by whether the study participant still had OC or sores in his/her mouth after 14 days of treatment. Also safety and tolerability of GV and nystatin in the treatment of OC were assessed.    ,NCT01427738

HIV,Reducing Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk in HIV on Antiretroviral Therapy Over 12 Months, This is a cohort study which follows two groups of participants over a 12 months period. One group will access a team approach to care with the aim of reducing their cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks from a team of doctors nurses and health care professionals. The other group will continue to access standard care from their treating doctor. Both groups will have CVD risk score evaluated after a 12 month period. The team care approach will involve specific tests to measure CVD risk as well as smoking cessation exercise and dietary advice and support including monitoring such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels    ,NCT01436136
HIV,The Effect of Probiotics in HIV-1 Infection, HIV progression is closely associated with chronic immune activation driven by leakage of bacterial products from a damaged gut the investigators largest immunological organ. Notably the degree of immune activation has been suggested to be a better predictor of disease progression than plasma viral load and markers of immune activation and gut damage have been identified as therapeutic targets per se. The major damage by HIV to the immune system is an initial massacre of gut mucosal CD4+ Th17 cells. Interestingly a normal gut flora has been shown to induce the maturation of Th17 cells in the small intestine mucosa. Preliminary reports have shown that the gut flora is altered in HIV-1 infection compared to controls. In this project the investigators will characterize microbial composition of gut flora in chronic HIV infection with ultradeep sequencing. Gut flora composition will be related to clinical data as well as quantitative data of circulating microbial products and activation markers. Second in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) the effect of probiotic lactobacilli on HIV pathogenesis and progression will be tested. This Gram-positive strain is clinically tested and is able to colonize the gut.    ,NCT01439841
HIV,Renal Transplantation and Raltegravir in HIV-Infected Patients, The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of acute renal graft rejection 6 months after transplantation in HIV-infected patients under three antiretroviral drugs regimen including Raltegravir.    ,NCT01453192
HIV,Rifaximin as a Modulator of Microbial Translocation and Immune Activation, This study is being done to see whether rifaximin an antibiotic that works in the intestines can lower the amount of germs in the intestines of HIV infected persons. It is possible that when the amount of these germs is lowered an HIV-infected person's immune system will become less active and will have a better chance of recovering. Also the study will evaluate the safety of using rifaximin in HIV-infected subjects.    ,NCT01466595

HIV,Impact of Raltegravir Intensification on HIV-1-infected Subjects With Complete Viral Suppression Under Monotherapy With Protease Inhibitors, This is a pilot proof of concept open-label clinical trial to assess the extend of persistent viral reservoir and the level of immune activation in patients receiving suppressive treatment with protease inhibitors. 40 Chronically HIV-1 infected subjects receiving monotherapy with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir or darunavir for at least 12 months with plasma viremia below 50 copies HIV RNA per ml and CD4 T-cell counts greater than 500 cells/mm3 will be included. The total duration of the study will be 48 weeks: 12 weeks for patients' inclusion 24 weeks of follow-up once the last patient is included and 12 weeks for data analysis.    ,NCT01480713
HIV,Laboratory Study of Licensed H1N1 Influenza Vaccines in HIV-1 Perinatally Infected Children and Youth," The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the immune response to the H1N1 influenza or ""flu"" vaccine. The ""immune response"" is how your body recognizes and defends itself against bacteria viruses and substances that may be harmful to the body. HIV-1 infected children typically respond more poorly to vaccines compared to uninfected healthy children and so this study hopes to learn whether or not the body will successfully produce enough antibodies (proteins that fight infection) that will prevent or fight the H1N1 flu virus. There is no information yet on the safety or immune response to this vaccine in children infected with HIV.    ",NCT01484522
HIV,Safety Efficacy and Dose-response Study of BMS-986001 in Subjects With HIV-1 Infection Who Are Treatment-naive, The purpose of this study is to identify at least one dose of BMS-986001 which is safe well tolerated and efficacious when combined with Efavirenz (EFV) + Lamivudine (3TC) for treatment-naive Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) infected subjects    ,NCT01489046
HIV,Lipopeptide Immunisation With GTU-multiHIV Trial," The combination of GTU-MultiHIV B DNA and LIPO-5 vaccines in a prime-boost strategy is expected to induce strong and diverse HIV-specific immune responses in HIV-infected patients. The investigators will carry out the clinical therapeutic immunization ""proof of concept"" trial in HIV infected patients. The investigators propose a multi-center double blind randomized versus placebo phase II clinical trial in patients who are chronic asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with undetectable viral load while treated with a potent combination of antiviral drugs. Patients will continue antiviral therapy combined with either therapeutic vaccination or placebo vaccination. Patients will undergo the procedure which includes a prime with the GTU-MultiHIV B DNA vaccine or placebo administered by IM injections via Biojector (a needle-free injection system) followed by a boost of LIPO-5 vaccine or placebo also given IM. In total 105 HIV-1 patients will be enrolled: 35 in the placebo arm and 70 in the vaccine arm. Patients will receive antiretroviral treatments and 3 administrations of DNA vaccine or its placebo at weeks 0 4 and 12 (corresponding to prime vaccinations). They also receive 2 doses of LIPO-5 vaccines or its placebo at week 20 and 24 (corresponding to boost vaccinations). At week 36 antiretroviral treatments will be interrupted until week 48. Patients will be intensely monitored during the treatment interruption period. After start of cART treatment (at the latest in W48) a data collection from clinical car will be carried out. A blood sample with W74 will allow to study the persistence ot the immunizing responses 1 year after the injection of the last vaccine/placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint is a plasma HIV-1 RNA level at week 48 (e.g. 12 weeks after stopping all antiviral treatment). The main hypothesis for conducting a phase II randomized trial is that immune responses in vaccinated patients may be associated with a better control of viral replication following c-ART interruption as compared to placebo-vaccinated patients.

HIV,Efficacy of Atazanavir/Ritonavir Monotherapy as Maintenance in Patients With Viral Suppression, The study will assess whether Atazanavir/ritonavir monotherapy provides a non-inferior proportion of virological efficacy with respect to ATV/RTV + 2 NRTIs in patients with stable suppressed viremia and no prior virologic failures.    ,NCT01511809
HIV,Effect of HAART Vs. Statin Treatment on Endothelial Function and Inflammation/Coagulation, Since people started taking HIV medications illnesses related to AIDS have decreased but other serious illnesses like heart disease (heart attacks) and certain kinds of cancer have increased. Studies show that HIV causes changes in the lining of the arteries and also causes inflammation (irritation) inside the body that may play a role in diseases like heart attacks and strokes. The levels of inflammation and artery lining health can also affect how well your brain works. These changes cannot be felt but can be measured. Artery lining health can be looked at with a test that uses a blood pressure cuff on your arm to see how the artery responds when air is let in and out of the cuff. An ultrasound (machine that uses sound waves) is used to look at the artery during the test. This test is called Flow Mediated Dilation or FMD for short. Inflammation can be checked with blood tests (blood tests that measure this irritation inside the body that you cannot feel). HIV medications can improve the artery lining health and can partially lower levels of inflammation in the blood; however these levels of inflammation may not be able to return back to normal. Pravastatin sodium is a medication that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating high cholesterol. Pravastatin sodium has also been able to improve the health of the lining of the arteries and lower the level of inflammation in people with other diseases but has not been studied or approved for this purpose in people who have HIV. This research study will look at the effects of two types of medications used separately or together on the health of the lining of arteries and levels of inflammation in the blood: Atripla (a HIV medication) and pravastatin sodium. This study will also look at the effects of Atripla and pravastatin sodium on cholesterol levels tests that measure how well you can think and calculate (tests of neurocognitive function) and at the effects of Atripla on the levels of pravastatin sodium in the blood.    ,NCT01515813
HIV,Effects of Losartan and Antiretroviral Regimen Containing Raltegravir in Fibrosis Inflammation Mediators Cardiovascular Risk and Neurocognitive Disorders in HIV Infected Patients Previously Effectively Treated, This is a open controlled trial in which 48 HIV-1 patients successfully treated with EFV/FTC/TDF will be randomized to one of 4 groups in equal proportion between arms (1:1). The four arms are as follows: Arm I: EFV / FTC / TDF (n = 12) Arm II: EFV / FTC / TDF + LST (n = 12) Arm III: FTC / TDF + MK-0518 (n = 12) Arm IV: FTC / TDF + LST + MK-0518 (n = 12) The allocation will take place in two phases: Phase I: 24 patients 1:1 receiving EFV/FTC/TDF vs. EFV/FTC/TDF + Losartan If losartan arm shows benefits we will proceed to the second phase: Phase II: 24 patients 1:1 to receive FTC/TDF+ MK-0518 versus FTC/TDF + MK-0518 + losartan. Patients will be followed up during 12 months to determinate the proportion of patients with decreased collagen deposition in TL equal to or greater than 50%.    ,NCT01529749
HIV,Sevelamer for Reducing Endotoxemia and Immune Activation, HIV-infected people can have an increase in inflammation in their body organs even after taking anti-HIV medicines. Sevelamer carbonate is used to bind phosphate in dialysis patients. It can also bind endotoxin in the gut and lowers endotoxin levels in the blood of dialysis patients. Sevelamer carbonate decreases the inflammation endotoxin causes in dialysis patients. A5296 is a phase II single-arm study to evaluate the effect of 8 weeks of sevelamer carbonate administration on markers of microbial translocation and T-cell activation in the blood in chronically HIV-infected subjects not receiving ART.    ,NCT01543958
HIV,Phase I/IIa Dose-escalation Clinical Study of VAC-3S, The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the therapeutic vaccine candidate VAC-3S in HIV-1 infected patients under AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART) with undetectable viral loads.    ,NCT01549119
HIV,Immunotherapy With Vacc-C5 With Adjuvant GM-CSF or Alhydrogel in HIV-1-infected Subjects on ART, Background: Despite the introduction of highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimes which control the HIV infection and results in increases in CD4 cell counts and an undetectable viral load many patients suffer from increased morbidity. There is evidence that presence of antibodies against the C5 region of gp120 strongly correlates with slower disease progression and that loss of antibody responses to this region are associated with progression. Investigational product: Vacc-C5 is a single heterodimeric peptide-based HIV therapeutic vaccine corresponding to the C5 region on gp120 and the external domain of gp41. The vaccine is intended to create a non-neutralizing antibody against C5 region. Study objectives:   1. To evaluate safety of the vaccination regimens   2. To evaluate C5-specific humoral immune responses (antibodies) T cell responses T cell activation markers and other immune markers.    ,NCT01627678

HIV,Vacc-4x + Lenalidomide vs. Vacc-4x +Placebo in HIV-1-infected Subjects on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), During the course of HIV infection the number of CD4 cells decreases resulting in a reduced immunological response and ultimately immune deficiency. Vacc-4x is a peptide-based HIV immunotherapy and the primary objective is to strengthen the immune system's response to HIV p24. By adding Lenalidomide an immunomodulatory agent as a supporting drug it is anticipated that the effect of Vacc-4x might be enhanced.    ,NCT01704781
HIV,Re-boosting of HIV-1 Infected Subjects With Vacc-4x, During the course of HIV infection the number of CD4 cells decreases resulting in a reduced immunological response and eventually immune deficiency. Vacc-4x is a peptide-based HIV immunotherapy vaccine and is anticipated to strengthen the immune system's response to HIV. All patients participating in this trial have previously received the vacc-4x vaccine in order to reduce the amount of HIV-1 virus in the blood and increase the immune response. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if a re-boost with Vacc-4x could further reduce the amount of HIV-1 virus and increase the immune response.    ,NCT01712256

HIV,Nevirapine vs Ritonavir-boosted Lopinavir in ART Naive HIV-infected Adults in a Resource Limited Setting, In resource-limited setting concerns remain regarding the emergence of virologic failure and high-level drug resistance mutations (DRM) during WHO recommended first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) based regimens for Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV1) infected patients. The study hypothesis is that a boosted-protease inhibitor regimen has a better outcome than a NNRTI-based regimen with a low genetic barrier to resistance. The study is a randomized multicenter factorial trial (conducted in Congo) in treatment- naïve adults receiving for 96 weeks ritonavir- boosted lopinavir(LPV/r) or nevirapine (NVP) each in combination with tenofovir (TDF) /emtricitabine (FTC) or zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC). The primary end point is the incidence of therapeutic (clinical and/or virologic)failure by study week 24.    ,NCT01772940
HIV,FTC/RPV/TDF on T-Cell Activation CD4 Cell Count Inflammatory Biomarkers and Viral Reservoir, This study is being done with people who are infected with HIV but do not show any signs of having HIV. They are also feeling well without taking HIV medication and have low or undetectable levels of the virus in the blood. The purpose of this study is to see if taking HIV medication (antiretroviral therapy [ART]) will reduce immune activation (a signal that the body is fighting an infection) in people who have HIV but do not show symptoms. Also this study will help determine how safe the drug is and how well people react to the drug. For this study the following antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be provided in the form of a single tablet that contains three different drugs: emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF). These drugs are combined as one tablet which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a single pill to treat HIV infection. The HIV medication provided is one of the recommended treatments for HIV including people with low viral loads (how much HIV you have in your body) who are taking HIV drugs for the first time. The risks seen with this HIV medication are the same that one would encounter when taking these drugs outside of the study.    ,NCT01777997
HIV,Rosuvastatin to Decrease Residual Immune Activation in HIV Infection, Participating countries: France Objectives Principal objective To evaluate in HIV-1 infected patients receiving effective antiretroviral therapy the effect of the addition of Rosuvastatin (dose of 20mg/day) for 3 months on CD8 T cell activation as assessed by the proportion of peripheral CD8 T cells that co-express the activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR Secondary objectives To evaluate the effect of Rosuvastatin administration on residual CD4 and CD8 T cell activation To evaluate the effect of Rosuvastatin administration on the main serum soluble biomarkers of activation (CRP- HS D-dimers IL-6 and soluble CD14) To evaluate the effect of Rosuvastatin administration on CD4 T-cell count and on the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio To study the relationship between the level of immune activation and the level of residual HIV replication in plasma To study the effect of Rosuvastatin administration on lipid profiles and the correlation between the HDL cholesterol and the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio To evaluate the tolerance of Rosuvastatin at the dose of 20 mg/day    ,NCT01874743
HIV,Evaluating Pharmacokinetic Interactions With Vaginal Ring Contraceptives and ART, This study will look at a method of hormonal birth control called the NuvaRing and specific anti-HIV medications called antiretrovirals (ARVs). Some studies of women who use a hormonal birth control method (specifically oral pills patches and injections) and take ARVs have shown that ARVs interact with the hormones released by the birth control medication. These interactions may cause the birth control to be less effective at preventing pregnancy. There is also concern that hormonal birth control can increase HIV spreading to others but more studies are needed to determine if this is true. The investigators do not know whether the NuvaRing and ARVs interact when they are used together so this study will look to see if certain ARVs (efavirenz and atazanavir/ritonavir) interact with the two hormones released by NuvaRing. This will help us to determine if NuvaRing is safe and effective for women with HIV infection who are taking ARVs. The study will also include HIV-infected women who are not on ARVs but will use the NuvaRing to show us what the hormone levels are like in a similar group of women not on ARVs. Vaginal rings are also currently being studied to deliver anti-HIV medications that may prevent HIV acquisition and to provide birth control over a longer period of time (more than 1 month). Since vaginal rings will become more commonly used to administer medications the investigators want to better understand the potential for drug interactions with drugs given vaginally. This study will also help us understand the potential for drug interactions between ARVs given orally and other drugs given through vaginal rings like the NuvaRing. Additionally this study will help us understand how hormones released from a vaginal ring affect the amount of HIV virus in the genital tract the bacterial make-up (microbiome) of the female genital track and the immune system within the genital tract all of which may affect the chances of spreading HIV.    ,NCT01903031
HIV,Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety Between Two Antiretroviral Regimens in HIV-1-infected Treatment-naïve Subjects With Low CD4 Counts, A phase IV prospective multicenter  randomized open label 48 weeks study to evaluate the antiretroviral efficacy and safety of atazanavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir each in combination with a fixed dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate- emtricitabine in HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve subjects with CD4 counts below 200 µL.    ,NCT01928407
HIV,Telmisartan to Reduce AIDS-Related Fibrotic and Inflammatory Contributors (TRAFIC Study), The main goal of this study is to see if a drug called telmisartan will decrease fibrosis (scarring) and inflammation (irritation) in people who are infected with HIV and doing well on their HIV medications. The study is also being done to see what effects telmisartan has on other signs of disease and inflammation in the body and to see whether people who have HIV can take telmisartan safely and without side effects that make them want to stop the drug. Telmisartan is FDA-approved for treating high blood pressure and decreasing the chance of heart attacks and strokes in people over the age of 55 years of age who are at high risk for these events.    ,NCT01928927
HIV,Pilot Peg-Interferon-a2b in Decreasing Viral DNA in HIV, We propose to test our primary hypothesis that treatment with Peg-IFN-α-2b will result in a decrease in integrated HIV DNA in peripheral blood and tissue in chronically HIV-infected immune-reconstituted individuals (see section 3.1) in a prospective interventional 1-arm open label clinical trial. To this end we propose to enroll 25 HIV-1-infected subjects (please refer to power calculations in section 10.1 below) currently stably suppressed (> 1y with VL < 50 copies/ml) on ART and with CD4 count > 450 cells/µl. We hypothesize that 20 weeks of treatment with Peg-IFN-alpha-2b in the presence of HIV reactivation (i.e.: ART interruption) will result in activation of intrinsic and/or immune-mediated anti-HIV mechanisms resulting in a decrease in the levels of viral reservoir in chronically HIV-infected immune-reconstituted individuals.    ,NCT01935089
HIV,VRC 601: A Phase I Open-Label Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a Human Monoclonal Antibody VRC HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) With Broad HIV-1 Neutralizing Activity Administered Intravenously or Subcutaneously to HIV-Infected..., This is the first clinical trial of the VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) monoclonal antibody. VRC01 is a broadly neutralizing antibody directed against HIV. This is a dose-escalation study to examine safety tolerability dose and pharmacokinetics of VRC01. The hypothesis is that VRC01 will be safe for administration to HIV-1 infected adults by the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) routes and will not elicit hypersensitivity reactions. Samples will be collected to learn if VRC01 is detectable in mucosal secretions and blood of participants and how long VRC01 can be detected in the blood after it is given. Between 15 and 25 HIV-1 infected adults ages 18-70 years will be enrolled. There are 4 dose escalation groups for IV administration; the doses are 1 mg/kg 5 mg/kg 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg. There is 1 group for SC administration at 5 mg/kg. Each group is expected to include at least 3 participants. Each participant will receive two infusions of VRC01 with about 1 month between doses. Infusions are administered in an inpatient unit and an overnight stay at the NIH Clinical Center is required. No more than one subject per day per group will receive a first infusion of the VRC01 product by the IV route and no more than one subject per week will receive a first infusion of the product by the SC route. Study participation lasts for 24 weeks. Participant health and effect on CD4 count and HIV viral load will be monitored. Samples will be collected and stored for research purposes.    ,NCT01950325
HIV,Multicentre Study To Assess Changes In Bone Mineral Density Of The Switch From Protease Inhibitors To Dolutegravir In HIV-1-Infected Subjects With Low Bone Mineral Density, Protease inhibitors (PI) have been associated with an acceleration of bone mineral density loss in HIV-infected individuals because of an enhanced osteoclast activity although some controversial data have been also published. A first study suggest an increase of bone mineral density after switching from PI to raltegravir the first generation integrase inhibitor but there are no more data about this subject. Based on data that PI decrease bone mineral density by accelerating osteoclast cells and that the discontinuation of this drugs could improve bone mineralization we propose a randomized prospective multicenter study to assess the impact of switching from PI to dolutegravir on bone mineral density in patients with low bone mineral density receiving a PI-containing regimen. At the same time the study will help to assess the antiviral efficacy and safety of a PI-sparing regimen including dolutegravir as a simplification strategy in virologically suppressed patients.    ,NCT01966822

HIV,Systematic Empirical vs. Test-guided Anti-TB Treatment Impact in Severely Immunosuppressed HIV-infected Adults Initiating ART With CD4 Cell Counts <100/mm3, In countries with a high tuberculosis (TB) prevalence TB and invasive bacterial infections are leading causes of early death in patients who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) with advanced immunodeficiency. We hypothesize that a systematic 6-month empirical TB treatment initiated 2 weeks before the introduction of ART in HIV-infected adults with severe immunosuppression (CD4<100/mm3) and no overt evidence of TB will reduce the risk of death and invasive bacterial infections. This strategy will be compared to one of extensive TB testing using point-of-care tests (Xpert MTB/RIF® and urine lipoarabinomanan LAM) and chest X-ray to identify and treat only patients with at least one positive test suggestive of TB.    ,NCT02057796
HIV,Multicentric Open-label Study of Switch From Abacavir/Lamivudine Fixed Dose Combination Plus Nevirapine to Abacavir/Lamivudine/Dolutegravir in Virologically Suppressed HIV-1 Infected Adults (SWAD), Abacavir/Lamivudine + Nevirapine (ABC/3TC + NVP) is a very effective and well tolerable regimen on the long-term. However this regimen comprises 2 pills per day. Abacavir/Lamivudine/Dolutegravir (ABC/3TC/DTG) offers simplification with a single pill per day with no food constraints Dolutegravir (DTG) having the advantage over Nevirapine (NVP) of high potency higher genetic barrier to resistance with a very good safety profile. The objective of this study is to evaluate the virologic safety (maintenance of virologic suppression) after switching from ABC/3TC + NVP to ABC/3TC/DTG in 50 HIV-1 infected adults with prolonged HIV RNA suppression on ABC/3TC + NVP as well as clinical and laboratory safety. Because nevirapine is a strong inducer of hepatic enzymes pharmacocinetic (PK) assessment will be performed in all patients in the first weeks after switch and 24-hours PK in a subset of 10 patients after 5 days of DTG addition to current regimen before switching to ABC/3TC/DTG.    ,NCT02067767

This study will consist of a 96 week double-blind treatment period. After Week 96 all participants will continue on blinded study drug treatment and attend visits every 12 weeks until treatment assignments are unblinded. All participants will return for an unblinding visit and will be given the option to receive open-label F/TAF and attend visits every 12 weeks until F/TAF is commercially available or the sponsor terminates the F/TAF clinical development program.    ,NCT02121795
HIV,Sofosbuvir-Containing Regimens Without Interferon For Treatment of Acute Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection, People who are recently infected with HCV have a great chance of being cured of the infection when they are treated with a combination of two drugs within the first 6 months of being infected. This study is being done to see if a combination of two new drugs in one pill can replace the old drugs to provide a safer more effective and better tolerated treatment for new HCV infection. The names of the new drugs are ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) and they will replace pegylated-interferon alfa (PEG-IFN a drug given as a weekly injection under the skin). The fixed-dose combination of LDV and SOF (LDV/SOF) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study started with participants in Group 1 receiving SOF in combination with RBV a drug also approved by the FDA for 12 weeks. There were a total of 17 participants in Group 1 and all completed treatment. All participants were monitored for safety and viral response while on treatment. After completing treatment all participants were evaluated for a treatment response after the end of treatment. If the treatment response in Group 1 was high enough the study design allowed for the possibility to decrease the length of therapy for Group 2 to 8 weeks using the same treatment. However this did not occur. Combined with the fact that a new and more effective treatment for chronic HCV has been approved since the study started Group 2 will now receive 8 weeks of LDV/SOF instead of 12 or 8 weeks of SOF with RBV.    ,NCT02128217
HIV,Modulation of Immune Activation by Aspirin, Since people started taking HIV medications illness from AIDS has decreased but other serious diseases like heart disease cancer and kidney and liver disease have increased. HIV causes inflammation (irritation) inside the body that cannot be felt but can be measured by blood. Inflammation can lead to diseases that have become some of the leading causes of death in people with HIV. HIV therapy can partially lower levels of inflammation measured in blood however levels of inflammation in people who have HIV may remain high compared with people not infected with HIV. Aspirin is a drug that is commonly used for pain relief but is also approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for preventing heart attacks and stroke in those who are at increased risk for heart attack and stroke. Aspirin also is used (but is not approved by the FDA) to decrease the risk of some cancers in people who are at increased risk. Aspirin is thought to decrease risk of heart attack and stroke because it blocks the activation of platelets and prevents blood clots from clogging narrowed blood vessels a disease called atherosclerosis. It is unknown how aspirin might decrease the chance of developing cancer in some people at higher risk but aspirin has been shown to modulate (or change) the immune system. In HIV-infected people who have been taking antiretroviral therapy and have an undetectable HIV viral load it was recently shown that low-dose aspirin 81 mg (baby aspirin) given for one week lowers platelet activation and reduces blood markers of inflammation which may improve the function of the immune system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether aspirin improves inflammation and immune activation when compared to a placebo (inactive medication like a dummy pill) and to determine if 12 weeks of aspirin 300 mg and aspirin 100 mg is safe for HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy. Additionally it studied whether a higher dose and longer duration of aspirin provides further anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating benefit. This was done using blood and urine tests that measure inflammation and also with a test that uses ultrasound to measure the flow of blood in your arm called flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery (BART). This is a painless test that bounces sound waves off of a blood vessel in your arm.    ,NCT02155985

HIV,Capacity of the Dual Combination Raltegravir/Etravirine to Maintain Virological Success in HIV-1 Infected Patients of at Least 45 Years of Age- ANRS 163 ETRAL, This multicenter international non randomized (single arm) open phase II trial aims to evaluate the capacity of the dual combination raltegravir/etravirine to maintain virological success in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected patients of at least 45 years of age switching from a boosted PI-containing regimen. Patients will be followed for 96 weeks. Measurement of primary endpoint will be at 48 weeks. Virological success is defined as the absence of 2 consecutive plasma viral load >50 copies/mL within 2 to 4 weeks of a dual raltegravir/etravirin regimen. Raltegravir/etravirine will be considered acceptable if the percentage of patients in virological success at week 48 is significantly above 90 %. Assuming a 95 % virological success rate by including 160 individuals and considering the strategy to be acceptable if no more than 8 individuals have virological failure; investigators will have a 95 % probability to discard a combination for which efficacy is smaller than 90 % and investigators will select with a power of 80 % the strategy for which the efficacy is above or equal to 95 %. The principal secondary endpoint is the proportion of patients in therapeutic success up to week 48 and 96.    ,NCT02212379

HIV,Progesterone Supplementation for HIV-positive Pregnant Women on Anti-Retrovirals, In pregnancy cART is considered optimal for maternal health and for preventing the emergence of resistance that could compromise further care. In Canada the majority of HIV-positive pregnant women receive a PI-based cART regimen. In the past therapy was generally deferred until after the first trimester (if not required for maternal health) to minimize any unknown risk of teratogenicity. However as treatment is now started earlier in HIV infection and as perinatal transmission rates are lowest in those with prolonged suppression of viral load during pregnancy women are increasingly commencing cART either before conception or earlier in pregnancy. Multiple reports and cohort studies provided data suggesting an association between PI-based cART use and preterm birth low birth weight and small for gestational age (SGA) babies although conflicting data exist. In the general population progesterone supplementation is widely used is well tolerated is considered safe and is beneficial to prevent recurrent pre-term birth and increase birth weight. The investigators experimental findings suggest that PI use during pregnancy is associated with declines in progesterone levels that correlate with fetal growth and that progesterone supplementation can improve PI-induced fetal growth restriction. The investigators preliminary findings in HIV+ pregnant women suggest that PI-use is associated with declines in progesterone levels which correlate with birth weight percentile. Since HIV-positive women have higher rates of pre-term delivery and low birth weight that may be magnified by the use of PIs then progesterone supplementation could be of benefit to neonatal health in the context of HIV-positive pregnancy.    ,NCT02400021

HIV,Probiotic Visbiome for Inflammation and Translocation in HIV II," Modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed the clinical care and lived experience of HIV infection. However increased rates of adverse health conditions that are related to immune activation such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurodegenerative disease in ART-treated individuals persist. An important cause of this inflammation is the gut CD4 T cell loss and the ""leaking"" or translocation of luminal gut bacteria and other microbes across the bowel wall and into the bloodstream. The use of complementary and alternative therapies is very common among people living with HIV with estimates ranging from 16-60%. However their efficacy has generally not been well demonstrated. Probiotics are live microbes that may provide a health benefit to the host and the investigators believe that the simultaneous use of probiotics along with ART will improve gut CD4 T cell restoration and function and therefore reduce microbial translocation and immune activation. A major challenge to HIV treatment is the suboptimal CD4 T cell count despite successful HIV suppression on ART in immunologic non-responders (INRs). These individuals are at increased risk of AIDS-related deaths and non-AIDS related comorbidities that may be associated with increased immune activation and microbial translocation from the gut mucosa. With limited treatment options alternative therapies to reduce inflammation and restore gut immunology will be important. Probiotic Visbiome consists of a high potency blend of eight different probiotics. The precise mechanism of action of Visbiome is unknownbut preclinical studies have shown that Visbiome may modulate the immune response towards an immunoregualtory phenotype with increased the levels of IL-10 and reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα IL1β and IL-8). Thereforethe investigators believe that the ""beneficial"" bacteria from Visbiome will accelerate the normalization of gut immune cells and function in HIV-infected INRs. It is hypothesized consumption of Visbiome for 48 weeks will help restore the immune system in INRs who have suboptimal immune reconstitution to currently available ART. Resolution of gut immune cells will mean that microbial translocation and immune activation will be normalized and will reduce the rates of HIV-associated comorbidities.    ",NCT02441231

The need to maintain antiretroviral therapy for life raises the long-term safety concerns of it even with the latest molecules. Also one of the key issues in clinical research is whether after reaching undetectable viral load antiretroviral treatment can be reduced in order to reduce exposure to molecules. Indeed this treatment of ""maintenance"" could potentially need a smaller antiviral potency. On the other hand reduction of antiretroviral treatment reduces costs an important consideration in light of new global recommendations of treatment for all patients with T-cells CD4 below 500 / mm3. The alleviation of antiretroviral therapy is to either reduce the number of molecules by making monotherapies or dual therapy or to realize or intermittent treatment is to reduce the doses of molecules such as randomized ENCORE -1 showing the equivalence of a dose of Efavirenz 400mg instead of 600mg in naive patients. Atalow study has the sense to lower the dose of Atazanavir / Ritonavir in combination with two NRTI to reduce exposure to this molecule and its cost while maintaining an undetectable viral load.

HIV,Effects of Dolutegravir Based Regimen on HIV-1 Reservoir and Immune Activation, We aim at comparing markers of HIV reservoir monocyte function and immune activation between antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve (chronic infection or primary infection) ART-controlled or ART-failing HIV infected adults initiating a dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimen. The investigators' purpose is to measure cell associated HIV-1 DNA monocyte function [soluble CD14 (sCD14) soluble CD163 (sCD163)] and immune activation [neopterine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)] biomarkers at different time points between baseline and week 48 post DTG-based regimen initiation in each group.    ,NCT02557997
HIV,Pharmacokinetics of Atazanavir /Dolutegravir/Lamivudine Regimen as Maintenance Regimen, During the past years the treatment of HIV-1 infection has transformed towards chronic treatment. Patients are being treated with antiretroviral drugs for many years and become older. The risk of developing side-effects due to long term antiretroviral therapy is therefore more and more likely. New alternative once-daily maintenance regimes are needed for those who are extensively pre-treated and experience side-effects or toxicity on standard treatment combinations. A possible once-daily fully active maintenance regimen is the combination of atazanavir (unboosted) dolutegravir and lamivudine (PRADAII regimen). This combination is expected to be a safe once-daily maintenance regimen with a favorable side-effect profile. The combination suits patients with intolerance and/or resistance to NRTIs NNRTIs and ritonavir who have a suppressed viral load. However for this new combination the pharmacokinetic profile is unknown and there are no data on short-term and long-term safety and efficacy. This study wille therefore asses the pharmacokinetics safety and efficacy in a small number of HIV-1 infected patients.    ,NCT02566707
HIV,Targeting Platelets in Chronic HIV Infection, Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have resulted in increased survival of the HIV-infected population; however this gain in longevity is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although ART and traditional risk factors contribute to CVD in this population heightened markers of immune activation inflammation and coagulation independently predict morbidity and mortality suggesting that dysregulation of these systems plays a significant role in the increased risk of CVD. The investigators believe that platelet activation is an important driver in HIV-associated immune activation inflammation and coagulation leading to an increased CVD pathophysiology and risk. Platelets initiate thrombus formation and also play a key role in vascular inflammation by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators and cross-talking with other relevant cell types including leukocytes. Researchers have described platelet hyperreactivity in chronic HIV infection. Importantly the investigators demonstrated that one week of anti-platelet therapy (aspirin) decreased platelet activation and immune activation with an improved trend in inflammation and immune parameters. The overall hypothesis is that platelet activation is a major driver of immune activation inflammation and thrombosis in ART-treated HIV infected patients. The purpose of the proposed proof-of-concept study is to understand the mechanism(s) by which anti-platelet therapy improves immune and inflammatory parameters in chronic HIV infection. To test this the immune modulating and anti-inflammatory effects of 24 weeks of the anti-platelet drug aspirin as compared to the anti-platelet drug clopidogrel will be evaluated. Given their different mechanisms of action and inhibitory potency the investigators can differentiate whether the potential benefits are mediated via inhibition of arachidonic acid (aspirin) or inhibition of ADP (clopidogrel) or by the antithrombotic activity. A secondary goal is to perform multidimensional assays of platelet activity and thrombogenicity alongside immune activation assays and careful assessments of traditional risk factors and medication regimens to understand which parameters are highly associated with thrombogenicity.    ,NCT02578706
HIV,The Effectiveness of Dual Therapy (Lopinavir/Ritonavir + LamivudinE) in Treatment-Experienced HIV Infected Patients in the Russian Federation, This study seeks to assess the virologic effectiveness of dual therapy (lopinavir/ ritonavir (LPV/r) + lamivudine (3TC)) in treatment-experienced human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected participants with an undetectable plasma HIV-1 (ribonucleic acid) RNA level (for at least 6 months) at the 48 week time point of treatment in the routine clinical settings of the Russian Federation.    ,NCT02581202
HIV,Dolutegravir Plus Lamivudine Dual Therapy in Treatment Naïve HIV-1 Patients, This study is being done to see if the combination of two anti-HIV medicines dolutegravir (DTG Tivicay) and lamivudine (3TC Epivir) taken once a day will provide a safe effective and well-tolerated treatment for HIV. DTG is a type of HIV medicine called an integrase inhibitor; 3TC is a type of HIV medicine called a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. DTG works by blocking integrase and 3TC works by blocking reverse transcriptase two HIV proteins (enzymes). This prevents HIV from multiplying and lowers the viral load (amount of HIV in the blood). Both DTG and 3TC are currently part of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended regimens along with a third active drug. Since some HIV medicines have side effects and are costly there is interest in whether HIV can be successfully controlled with fewer than three HIV drugs.    ,NCT02582684

HIV,12 Weeks of Ledipasvir (LDV)/Sofosbuvir (SOF) With Weight-based Ribavirin vs. 24 Weeks of LDV/SOF, People who are infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) have a great chance of being cured of the infection when they are treated with sofosbuvir. However in some instances treatment with sofosbuvir-containing therapy does not work. It is not known if treating people with sofosbuvir again (retreatment) after it did not work the first time will work. There is an important need to understand retreatment options in those instances. This study is being done to see if two different regimens ledipasvir with sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks (Group A) and ledipasvir with sofosbuvir for 24 weeks (Group B) are well tolerated in HCV-infected persons where previous treatment with sofosbuvir failed.

HIV,Efficacy and Safety of a Dolutegravir-based Regimen for the Initial Management of HIV Infected Adults in Resource-limited Settings, Several reports indicate that treatment failure due to HIV resistance or to adverse event-related discontinuation could compromise the effectiveness of scaling-up antiretroviral treatment (ART) especially when lack of access to viral load is a concern. Combined with other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor Dolutegravir (DTG) is a very promising alternative to the current first-line non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens. Initial evaluations of DTG conducted in high income countries showed excellent efficacy and safety and indicated high genetic barrier thus preserving second line treatment. As a consequence DTG-based regimens have been recently included in the first-line options in the national guidelines for ART of several high-income countries. However the clinical trials evaluating DTG-based regimens have been conducted in highly controlled conditions including baseline resistance testing and regular viral load monitoring. Moreover these trials included a high proportion of men with rare co-morbidities. There is need to evaluate how a DTG-based regimen will perform in real-world conditions within resources-constrained settings where viral load monitoring is limited and where the majority of HIV patients are women with important family planning consideration and NAMSAL trial is a randomized clinical trial which aims to evaluate efficacy and safety over 48 weeks of DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine versus Efavirenz (EFV) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine in 606 ART-naïve HIV-1-infected adults in Cameroon.

HIV,PREPARE (A5361s) Substudy of REPRIEVE (A5332), Aging with HIV may be related to an earlier development of frailty (weakness) or disability including difficulties in tests of strength or walking speed. Few treatments have been shown to prevent or slow these impairments in people with or without HIV. Some studies have suggested that the class of drugs called statins (for example pitavastatin) might be helpful in slowing frailty or disability. This might happen by decreasing fat within the muscle or by decreasing inflammation markers (substances in the blood that determine how the body reacts to infection or irritation) in the blood. Other studies have shown that statins increase the risk of muscle aches and pains. This substudy is being done to determine the impact of the drug pitavastatin on muscle.    ,NCT03070223

HIV,Trial of TDF/FTC + Raltegravir Versus TDF/FTC + Efavirenz in HIV-1-Infected Women, Raltegravir not only has a unique mechanism of action but may also have other unique effects on suppression of viral replication viral reservoir and immune reconstitution in blood and other important compartments. This may in part be due to the pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir in blood and gut tissue. Efavirenz will be the comparator antiretroviral drug in this study with both drugs being used as part of a three-drug regimen with tenofovir and emtricitabine. The primary objectives are to determine differences in the effects of 2 anti-retroviral regimens Raltegravir + Truvada versus Atripla with respect to:   1. Viral load in plasma genital tract (vaginal secretions) and gut (by in situ hybridization).   2. Latent viral reservoir (pro-viral DNA) in the peripheral blood and genital tract.   3. Immune effects (CD4/CD8 immunophenotypes) in gut and PBMCs and plasma cytokine profiles. The secondary objective is to determine the pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir in blood and gut tissue; relative tissue/compartment penetration compared to Efavirenz.    ,NCT00984152

HIV,Impact of Cotrimoxazole Use in Immunocompetent HIV Patients on Carriage of Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria, Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) is recommended for prevention of morbidity and mortality due to Pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections in HIV positive patients with low immunity. Common clinical practice is to start CPT in any patient with CD4 counts below 200/µL and conversely to stop CPT when immunity has been restored by antiretroviral treatment to CD4 counts above 200/µL or when viral suppression has been documented for 3 months. However the latest WHO guidelines widely expands the indication for CPT by advocating for settings with high prevalence of malaria and bacterial infections that all patients with HIV start CPT regardless of CD4 counts and clinical stage. Furthermore WHO recommends these patients to continue CPT indefinitely regardless of evidence of immune restoration (The recommendation is for settings with high prevalence of malaria and bacterial infections not for high-income countries). There is limited scientific evidence to recommend prolonged CPT as studies have shown it is associated with modestly reduced morbidity due to pneumonia meningitis and malaria but no corresponding reduction in mortality. The impact of such a large increase in antibiotic use on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has not been thoroughly considered. Our previous studies in Tanzania showed that multidrug-resistant bacteria frequently cause bloodstream infections with resultant very high case-fatality rates. As genes encoding for multiple antibiotic resistance traits are transferred by plasmids together with resistance towards cotrimoxazole prolonged CPT will likely favor the selection of carriage of multidrug-resistant gut bacteria. The proposed randomized clinical trial is designed to assess whether prolonged CPT in HIV-positive patients results in increased fecal carriage of multi-drug resistant gut microbes or increased nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Secondary endpoints are morbidity (clinical events hospitalizations) and mortality. Stool specimens nasal swabs and clinical data will be collected from persons attending voluntary counseling and testing facilities and HIV-clinics in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. The study results may have important impact on public health in terms of assisting development of rational recommendations for CPT use and may help prevent emerging antibiotic resistance.    ,NCT03087890

HIV,Trial Evaluating a First Line Combination Therapy With Raltegravir Emtricitabine and Tenofovir in HIV-2 Infected Patients, The HIV-2 is less common ie 1-2 million people in West Africa. HIV-2 does have the same sensibility to antiretroviral treatment (ART) compared to HIV-1. The ART strategies that are appropriate for the HIV-1 infection are not as effective for HIV-2. Classical triple therapy including PI is less effective for HIV-2. Also the choice of ARTs in a second line treatment is limited. The first line optimal treatment has to be defined by a prospective and randomized evaluation of other strategies. The primary endpoint will be adapted to the specificity of the HIV-2 infection. The 1st step is to define with a phase II clinical trial whether a strategy including 2 NRTIs and raltegravir as an alternative strategy to the classical triple therapy shows an immunovirological response at least as good as the one obtained with the triple therapy. The hypothesis is that the low ART response observed in HIV-2 infection is due to a low virological strength of the ARTs used and that the combination of 2 NRTIs and raltegravir should show a therapeutic success of at least 50% at week 48.    ,NCT01605890

HIV,An Open Label Trial of Stribild for Antiretroviral (ARV)-naïve HIV-2 Infected Adults in Dakar Senegal, There is a critical need for safe and effective antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens for HIV-2 infection. This is especially true in West Africa where the vast majority of the 1-2 million individuals infected with HIV-2 live and were access to effective ART for HIV-2 is limited. HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (T-20) and mutations conferring broad resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are frequently observed in HIV-2 from patients receiving ART. Although antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PI) can be used effectively to treat HIV- 2 HIV-1 and HIV-2 also exhibit important differences in their susceptibilities with studies indicating that saquinavir (SQV) lopinavir (LPV) and darunavir (DRV) are the only potent PI's against HIV-2 replication and cross-resistance is frequent. Although an increasing body of evidence supports the potential utility of integrase inhibitors (INI) against HIV-2 there have been no clinical trials to assess their effectiveness and they are not routinely available in resource-limited settings. These limitations present major challenges to HIV-2 treatment particularly in the areas in which it is most prevalent. This study is the 1st use of STRIBILD (elvitegravir (EVG) cobicistat (COBI) emtricitabine (FTC) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)) an INI-based single tablet regimen in HIV-2 infected adults in West Africa. The investigators hypothesize STRIBILD will be safe and effective as ART for HIV-2 infection. The Specific Aims of this study are: AIM 1: A pilot open label 48 week trial of STRIBILD (elvitegravir cobicistat emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in 30 ARV-naïve HIV-2 Infected Adults in Dakar Senegal. AIM 2: Determination of genotypic and phenotypic HIV-2 antiretroviral resistance in individuals with virologic failure (HIV-2 plasma RNA >250 copies/ml) participating in the 48 week trial of STRIBILD    ,NCT02180438

HIV,Mild Neurocognitive Disorder in HIV Infection of the Brain, Background: - Some people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) develop problems with thinking and concentration when the virus affects the brain. This is known as mild neurocognitive disorder (MND). Research has shown that some HIV medications do not get through the blood brain barrier very well. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a brain protein that is part of the blood brain barrier. Differences in the activity of P-gp may help explain why some people with HIV develop MND. It is also possible that MND is partly due to inflammation in the brain. Researchers want to study P-gp and its effect on MND and HIV infection. Objectives: - To study P-gp and brain inflammation related to HIV infection. Eligibility:   -  Individuals between 18 and 60 years of age who have HIV and either do or do not have MND.   -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine samples will be collected.   -  Participants will have one outpatient visit and one 3-day inpatient stay.   -  At the outpatient visit participants will provide blood samples and have a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). The spinal tap will collect cerebrospinal fluid for study.   -  At the inpatient visit participants will have two positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brain. These scans will study brain activity and possible inflammation. One scan will involve a study drug called tariquidar which blocks the activity of P-gp. A second lumbar puncture will be done before the first PET scan. Blood and urine samples will be collected daily.    ,NCT01547754
HIV,Vitamin D Supplements for HIV-positive Patients on cART, The ability of vitamin D to modulate the immune system and strengthen bones may mitigate the adverse medication consequences of HIV/AIDS but little is known about either the health benefits of vitamin D supplements or about the optimal dosing regimen for patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This trial is a comparison of two regimens for administering vitamin D and calcium to HIV-positive individuals taking antiviral medications. This study will help physicians make evidence-based decisions about the most effective way to use vitamin D in their patients and enable the design of large multi-center trials in the future.    ,NCT01295034

HIV,Evaluation of Albuminuria HIV-Infected Patients, This study will examine the following: 1) how common albuminuria and proteinuria are among HIV-positive patients 2) what causes albuminuria or proteinuria in these patients and 3) whether the condition becomes more severe over time. HIV-infected people are more likely than others to develop kidney disease. The earliest indicator of the possible presence of kidney disease is albuminuria (increased amounts of the protein albumin in the urine). A later indicator is the appearance of other proteins a condition called proteinuria. HIV-infected patients 8 years of age and older who do not have diabetes chronic kidney disease or cancer may be eligible for this study. Participants provide a urine sample during three visits as follows: the first upon enrollment in the study a second 3 months later and a third about 6 months after that. Blood samples are drawn at the first and last visits. At the first visit a medical history is taken and blood pressure height weight waist circumference hip circumference and upper arm skin thickness are measured. Participants who are found to have albuminuria or proteinuria are asked to undergo a kidney biopsy for research purposes. The procedure is optional. Participants who develop heavy proteinuria may be recommended to undergo a kidney biopsy in order to determine the nature of the kidney disease and begin treatment. The biopsy requires a 2-day hospital stay. For the procedure an anesthetic is given to numb the skin and a needle is inserted and guided into the kidney to withdraw a small tissue sample. The needle is passed twice and possibly three times. Following the procedure the subject remains in bed rest for at least 10 hours to minimize the risk of excessive bleeding....    ,NCT00524992
HIV,Prospective Study on HIV-related Hodgkin Lymphoma, Standard therapy for HIV-related Hodgkin lymphoma (HIV-HL) has not been defined. This trial was initiated to investigate a risk adapted treatment strategy in patients (pts) with HIV-HL as established in HIV-negative patients with HL. Treatment schedule:   -  Early stage favorable Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL): 2 cycles of doxorubicin bleomycin vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) plus 30 Gy involved field (IF) radiation   -  Early stage unfavorable HL: 4 cycles of bleomycin etoposide doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine procarbazine and prednisone (BEACOPP)-baseline or 4 cycles of ABVD plus 30 Gy IF radiation   -  Advanced HL: 8 cycles of BEACOPP-baseline. BEACOPP should be replaced by ABVD in pts with far advanced HIV-infection. After the completion of chemotherapy sites of initial bulky disease (those at least 5 cm in diameter) and residual tumor larger than 2.5 cm in diameter receive 30 Gy of irradiation.   -  Primary outcome measure: tolerability treatment-related mortality   -  Secondary outcome measure: complete remission rate progression-free survival (PFS) overall survival (OS).    ,NCT01468740
HIV,Effect of DHA on Lipid and Carbohydrate Metabolism Alterations and Body Fat Distribution in HIV Patients Under HAART., Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is able to cause lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis alterations which are associated to the redistribution of body fat. Alterations in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism contribute to the development of a highly atherogenic profile which together with altered fibrinolysis markers and increased presence of proinflammatory cytokines in blood (especially tumor necrosis factor alpha) that comes associated to the success of HAART can cause the development of accelerated atherosclerosis. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that has demonstrated its ability to reduce triglyceride levels; modify cholesterol fractions and increase the size of LDL particles thereby configuring less atherogenic plasma profile. Additionally administration of DHA has shown antiinflammatory and hypotensive activity which contributes to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications in these patients. At a molecular level DHA acts as a stimulator of the nuclear receptor PPAR-gamma which has been described to induce an increase in adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore the anti-inflammatory effects induced by DHA can decrease the elevated levels of TNF-alpha which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of body fat redistribution in HIV infected patients undergoing HAART. Therefore the hypothesis of this project is that DHA will be able to produce lipid-lowering anti-inflammatory hypotensive and profibrinolytic effects which all together should improve atherogenic profile of patients with HIV-1 infection receiving HAART. In addition their proprieties as PPAR agonist can improve the redistribution of body fat present in many of these patients. The study of the activity of DHA on dendritic cells and monocytes should indicate the absence of immunosuppressive effect of DHA in the context of HIV-1 infection. In summary DHA is a natural product from the omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids the therapeutic properties of which have been described in recent years and has shown cardio-vascular and metabolic beneficial effects without recognized side effects. The highly purified DHA administration at high doses could be able to reverse at least partially lipid abnormalities associated with HAART and to exert a beneficial effect on fat redistribution in HIV-infected patients treated with HAART. To ensure non deleterious immunological treat in these sensitive poly-medicated patients substantial changes in the functionality of dendritic cells and monocytic will be studied.    ,NCT02005900

HIV,Study of Reyataz in HIV-infected Patients With Lipodystrophy Syndrome, The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects with abdominal fat accumulation on their highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) regimen have better changes in fat distribution after switching to atazanavir-ritonavir than those remaining on their current protease inhibitor boosted HAART regimen.    ,NCT00135356
HIV,Comparing a Nucleoside-Analogue-Sparing Regimen and a Protease-Inhibitor-Sparing Regimen in HIV Infected Patients, Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the long time survival of HIV infected individuals. However an increasing number of HIV-patients have developed metabolic and morphological alterations including peripheral lipoatrophy. There is limited knowledge about lipodystrophic adverse events in nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-sparing regimens. The hypothesis is that nucleoside analogues are responsible for development of lipoatrophy and patients receiving an NRTI-sparing regimen will have little risk of peripheral lipoatrophy. The researchers plan to perform a randomized study recruiting 100 antiretroviral naive patients that will be randomized to receive a nucleoside analogue sparing HAART regimen or a protease-inhibitor sparing regimen. The main endpoint is changes in peripheral fat mass as determined by dual energy X-ray absortiometry (DEXA)-scanning.    ,NCT00135460

HIV,Safety Tolerability and Efficacy of Asunaprevir and Daclatasvir in Subjects Coinfected With HIV-HCV, Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem with an estimated 180 million people infected worldwide. In the United States an estimated 4.1 million people are infected and HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading indication for liver transplantation. Within HIV/HCV co-infected patients liver disease due to Hepatitis C progresses even more rapidly. While combination of ribavirin (RBV) and pegylated interferon (PEG) in combination with boceprevir/telaprevir is the currently recommended therapy for chronic HCV infection and has superior cure rates compared to PEG+RBV alone in HCV monoinfected patients treatment is still associated with a high incidence of adverse events (AEs) discontinuations and poor cure rates in several populations. Within the HIV/HCV co-infected population treatment for HCV remains complicated given drug interactions between anti-retrovirals and HCV protease inhibitors in addition to the extensive side-effects due to PEG +RBV alone. Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of a combination of anti-virals which target HCV without interferon (IFN) can cure HCV without additional toxicities. These novel therapies that do not rely on an IFN backbone may additionally enhance cure rates in HIV/HCV co-infected a population which has historically been difficult to cure. This is an open label study to assess the safety tolerability and efficacy of asunaprevir (ASV) 100 mg BID and daclatasvir (DCV) 60 mg daily (selective HCV NS3 and NS5A inhibitors respectively) in 20 HIV/HCV co-infected treatment-na(SqrRoot) ve and treatment experienced HCV genotype 1b individuals. The findings from this study will aid in the understanding of antiviral and host responses and determinants of response to an IFN free regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.    ,NCT02124044
HIV,Analysis of Host Genetic Factors in the Occurrence of Anemia and on the Virological Response to a Peg-interferon/Ribavirin Therapy in HIV-HCV Co-infected Patients, The treatment of HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection has made significant progress over the past decade with the therapy combining pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) to ribavirin (RBV). The cure of HCV infection which consists to obtain a sustained virological response (SVR) (undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after end of treatment) is reached in more than 50% of patients infected with HCV. However this rate is much lower around 30 to 40% in HIV-HCV co-infected patients and sometimes can be less than 20% for patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Haemolytic anemia is a dose-limiting adverse effect which occurs frequently under RBV therapy. RBV-induced anemia represents the main cause of treatment discontinuation or dose reduction of RBV thus limiting the chances of achieving a SVR. RBV has a large inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability and a relationship between the occurrence of anemia and RBV concentration was clearly demonstrated. However other factors including genetic factors could be predictive of hematotoxicity and/or a better efficiency. In particular IL-28B polymorphism analysis in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 before starting antiviral therapy could predict the response to treatment (positive predictive value). The genetic polymorphism of inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) is also strongly associated to a protective effect towards the RBV-induced-anemia. But most of these data are issued from studies performed in a Japanese HCV mono-infected population treated with Peg-IFN-RBV therapy for which there is no other causal variant that the rs1127354. Only few studies are reported in the literature in caucasian HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Moreover data on RBV plasma exposure are very scarce in all these studies showing an impact of the ITPA polymorphism on the occurrence of anemia. In addition others polymorphisms of SCL29A1/A2 and SCL28A2/A3 coding for RBV transporters ENT (equilibrative nucleoside transporter) et CNT (concentrative nucleoside transporter) would be associated to either rapid virological response or anemia in HCV infected patients treated by Peg-IFN plus RBV. No study considering both polymorphisms of ITPA IL-28B SCL29A1/A2 and SCL28A2/A3 genes and RBV plasma exposure data has so far been conducted in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Thus it would be interesting in a first time to assess the impact of the ITPA polymorphism on both the RBV plasma exposure and the protective effect towards RBV-induced anemia in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. This study could be helpful to the literature for possible further RBV dose adjustments according to ITPA activity. Then it would be relevant to further complete these data by assessing other genetic polymorphisms as IL-28B SCL29A1/A2 and SCL28A2/A3 and thus evaluate the overall pharmacogenetic relationships towards RBV-induced anaemia and/or virological response to a Peg-IFN/RBV therapy.    ,NCT01964742

HIV,Physiologic Investigation of the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Axis in HIV, The purpose of this study is to see if individuals with HIV-infection particularly those with increased belly fat have abnormalities in the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis. Renin angiotensin and aldosterone are hormones that regulate salt and water balance in the body and they may also have effects on sugar metabolism and cardiovascular health. There is some evidence that individuals with HIV-associated abdominal fat accumulation may have increased aldosterone which may contribute to abnormalities in sugar metabolism and increased cardiovascular disease seen in HIV. The purpose of this study is the measure renin angiotensin and aldosterone activity as well as other hormonal axes in people with and without HIV infection and with and without increased belly fat. The investigators hypothesize that aldosterone will be increased in HIV-infected individuals compared to those without HIV-infection and that aldosterone will be further increased in HIV-infected individuals with increased abdominal fat compared to those without abdominal fat accumulation.    ,NCT01407237

HIV,Novel Measures and Theory of Pediatric Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence in Uganda, Current measures of adherence detect problems weeks to months after they occur. Because the HIV virus rapidly begins replicating and mutating in the absence of effective antiretroviral therapy treatment failure may develop before an intervention can be deployed. Real-time objective adherence monitoring could redirect efforts from a reactive response to the proactive prevention of treatment failure. Because adherence is so closely associated with viral suppression accurate adherence monitoring could also strategically limit viral monitoring only to those patients at a defined risk for viral rebound. This observational study is assessing a wireless adherence monitoring device and mobile phone-based adherence data collection among caregivers of children under the age of ten years in Mbarara Uganda. It involves both quantitative and qualitative measures of the feasibility and acceptability of these measures as well as circumstances of adherence lapses and other individual and cultural factors affecting adherence. The qualitative data will be used to explore models of adherence behavior which will likely include the child-caregiver dynamic the child's mental and physical health and social support mechanism.    ,NCT01140633

HIV,Leukapheresis to Obtain Plasma or Lymphocytes for Studies of HIV-infected Patients Including Long-term Non-progressors, This study will collect white blood cells and plasma for research on how the immune system controls HIV infection. The immune system of a very small group of HIV-infected patients called non-progressors has been able to control HIV for long periods without antiretroviral therapy. Some immune system-related genes important for this control have been identified in these patients. This study will examine the contribution of HLA genes B*57+ B*27+ and A*01+ to HIV disease in progressors and long-term non-progressors. (HLA type is a genetic marker of the immune system.) HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with HLA types B*57+ B*27+ and/or A*01+ may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo apheresis-a method for collecting larger quantities of certain blood components than can safely be collected through a simple blood draw-by one of the following two methods:   -  Automated pheresis - Blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein and spun in a machine separating the blood components. The white cells are extracted and the red cells with or without plasma (liquid part of the blood) are re-infused into the donor through the same needle or a needle in the other arm. An anticoagulant (medication to prevent blood from clotting) is usually added to the blood while in the machine to prevent it from clotting during processing.   -  Manual pheresis - One unit (1 pint) of blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein similar to donating a pint of whole blood. The red blood cells with or without plasma are separated from the rest of the blood and re-infused to the donor through the same needle. Manual pheresis will be done only when a person s estimated total blood volume or red cell count is too low to safely permit removal of blood through a pheresis machine. An adult small in size or markedly anemic for example may fall into this category. Some of the blood collected through apheresis may be stored for future studies of HIV disease and immune function and for HLA testing a genetic test of markers of the immune system. Some of the blood may be used to screen for different types of viral liver infections such as hepatitis A B C D E F or G.    ,NCT00029445

HIV,HIV Prevention in the Primary Care Setting, In the third decade of the HIV pandemic what was once a uniformly and rapidly fatal disease has been transformed into a chronic illness by advances in the understanding of HIV pathogenesis and therapeutics. As a result HIV-infected individuals are living longer and better lives. This phenomenon coupled with a continued steady rate of new HIV infections in this country has led to the highest U.S. HIV prevalence rates since the beginning of the epidemic. In the past HIV prevention efforts were separate from routine primary care delivery due to multiple factors including stigma and time constraints. Recent events including increases in sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates among HIV-infected persons and evidence that infected individuals can be super-infected by HIV strains resistant to antiretroviral therapy have inspired the SPNS program initiative to develop demonstration projects for interventions to reduce risky sexual exposures among HIV-infected patients receiving primary care.    ,NCT00381524

HIV,A Phase I Study of Quadrivalent Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) (Types 6 11 16 18) Recombinant Vaccine in HIV-Infected and HIV-Negative Pre-Adolescents Adolescents and Young Adults, Background:   -  Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted disease. There are more than 100 different HPV types and both males and females can get HPV infection. Most people do not have any symptoms when they become infected and are able to get rid of the infection on their own. However they can still become re-infected with the same or a different HPV type and in some people HPV infection persists.   -  Persistent HPV infection is associated with the development of precancerous lesions and cancer. HPV types are classified as either high risk or low risk based on whether their persistence will lead to cancer.   -  Patients who have suppressed immune systems are at a higher risk for HPV-related complications. They are more likely to contract multiple HPV types and have more persistent infection that can lead to precancerous lesions or cancer which are then difficult to treat and often recur.   -  A recently approved vaccine for HPV induces immunity to HPV 6 11 16 and 18. It was shown to be highly effective in preventing infection with these HPV types and is approved for use in females 9 to 26 years of age. However much less is known about the vaccine s ability to induce immunity in males or individuals with suppressed immune systems. Objectives: - To investigate whether the HPV vaccine is safe to give and able to induce immunity in both female and male adolescents and young adults with HIV infection compared to healthy HIV-negative persons of the same age. Eligibility: - Males and females 12 to 26 years of age divided into three groups: (1) Healthy and HIV-negative (2) HIV-positive and on antiretroviral therapy and (3) HIV-positive and not on antiretroviral therapy. Design:   -  Before beginning vaccination participants will have a complete physical examination and blood drawn for routine blood tests special tests of the immune system antibody tests and an HIV test.   -  HPV vaccine will be given by injection into the muscle at 0 2 and 6 months according to the standard vaccination schedule.   -  Patients with HIV infection will be monitored for a week following the first injection to test the level of HIV in the blood 3 days and 5 days after the first injection.   -  Participants will also be asked to fill out a 10- to 15-minute Web-based survey about awareness health behaviors and personal choices related to risk factors for HIV HPV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Participants are not required to fill out the survey to receive the vaccine.   -  The total duration of the study is 4 years. During the first year of the study participants will return for six additional 1-day visits at months 1 2 3 6 7 and 12. Participants will return for 1-day visits every 6 months for the remaining 3 years.    ,NCT00798265
HIV,Adjusting Antiretroviral Therapy Dosage Using Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, Background Low concentrations of protease inhibitors (PIs) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are associated with an increased risk of virological failure. Likewise excessive antiretroviral drug concentrations increase the risk of toxicity. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may identify and correct excessively high or low PI and/or NNRTI concentrations and thus minimize toxicity and risk of treatment failure. Treatment guidelines only recommend using TDM to help optimize ARV therapy in selected patients and there are no clear recommendations to guide the clinician who decides to adjust drug doses. Prospective studies have demonstrated the relationship between EFV plasma concentration and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Moreover EFV is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 2B6 and its concentration was reported to be associated with the CYP2B6 516GrT genetic polymorphism. For drugs such as EFV or LPV/r lower doses than the ones validated for standard clinical use have demonstrated efficacy in dose-ranging studies. The investigators will use a standardised algorithm to reduce doses in patients with plasma EFV or LPV/r concentration above percentile 75. This algorithm is based on a Bayesian approach from the pharmacology unit in Lausanne. The investigators hypothesize that a dosage individualisation is feasible and safe. 2.2 Study Aims The investigators aim at testing a simplified algorithm for dose reduction in patients with documented virological efficacy treated by a stable LPV/r or EFV based regimen with elevated plasma concentration of these drugs. Study Design Prospective open label study in which all eligible patients screened with a plasma drug concentration of either EFV or LPV/r above percentile 75 will be included. After confirmation of the results at baseline patients will be offered to decrease drug dosage by a third or a half according to a standardised algorithm. All patients will undergo HIVRNA biochemistry and validated questionnaires after 3 and 6 months to assess the safety and the benefit of this strategy.    ,NCT00836212

HIV,Comparison of Concentration-time Course of Plasma and Intracellular Raltegravir in Healthy Volunteers, The investigators hypothesize that the concentration-time profile of raltegravir is different in cells than that in plasma.

HIV,Notification of Donors With Positive Microbiology Markers, Each year around 200 blood donors in the UK are found to be infected with blood-borne diseases (HIV hepatitis B hepatitis C and HTLV) while several others have been identified as having an increased risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). Although the notification procedures for these infections vary their effectiveness and appropriateness have never been evaluated in a systematic study. The proposed research has been designed to assess the responses of blood donors to notification and their satisfaction with how they were informed about the infection. The study will be implemented using standard questionnaire-based measures (French et al 2004; Marteau & Bekker 1992). The study will involve approximately 600 blood donors who were informed of an infection or possible infection with blood-borne diseases in 2008 and 2009 and approximately 100 donors notified of possible risk of vCJD infection in 2005. A comparable group of 2005 donors will be included to control for the effects of time. As the majority of donors testing positive donated to NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) the participants will be identified from the NHSBT database only and their availability confirmed through their GP or specialist clinician. A standardized questionnaire will be then sent to all those identified as eligible. The study will last 12 months but direct participant involvement will be limited to the time required to complete the questionnaire which should take under one hour. To safeguard confidentiality no identifiable personal data will be used in the analysis. Where demographic or medical information already held by NHSBT is retrieved to minimise response burden this will be pseudonymised before use. The study is sponsored by the blood services for England Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland. The results will be used to inform notification procedures in the future.    ,NCT01050881

HIV,Tenofovir Emtricitabine Efavirenz and Atazanavir Pharmacokinetics in the Aging HIV-Infected Population, Purpose: To see how growing older changes the amount of HIV drugs in the blood of HIV-infected men and women. Many changes happen in the body as it ages that may affect the way drugs are carried in the blood broken down or removed from the body. This study will look at the amount of drug in the blood and cells of the immune system for patients taking efavirenz tenofovir and emtricitabine or atazanavir boosted with ritonavir tenofovir and emtricitabine. Participants: The population will comprise of 56 (6 for intensive PK and 50 for sparse sampling) HIV-infected adults currently adhering to an antiretroviral regimen containing efavirenz with tenofovir and emtricitabine and the same number and distribution of HIV-infected adults currently adhering to an antiretroviral regimen containing atazanavir boosted with ritonavir with tenofovir and emtricitabine. Procedures (methods): This study will be completed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There will be four groups of subjects: Efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group A Efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group B Atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group A and Atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group B. The initial six subjects (Group A) for intensive PK analysis for each regimen will be recruited from the the UNC ID Clinic or the Moses Cone Health System Infectious Diseases Clinic and will be comprised of non-frail subjects not currently receiving interacting drugs. If subjects provide informed consent timed blood samples will be obtained to determine pharmacokinetic parameters around an observed dose of one of the two study regimens. A whole blood sample will also be collected and stored for potential drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters genotyping in the future. Group A subjects will complete a follow-up visit after their sampling visit. 50 subsequent subjects (Group B) for each regimen will be screened simultaneously with no more than 10 subjects enrolled for each regimen in Group B prior to the completion and analysis of Group A. These subjects will also be recruited from either site. Group B subjects will have one or two sampling visits with 1 to 4 blood samples obtained at each visit with a stored sample for future genotyping obtained on one of the visits. Samples will be collected just prior to a dose at 2 hours between 4 and 6 hrs and between 10 and 14 hours after a medication dose. These visits may coincide with the subjects' regularly scheduled visit to the clinic or be scheduled separately depending on the preference and availability of the subject.    ,NCT01180075
HIV,Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Immune Reconstitution in HIV-infected Patients, HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells that eventually leads to clinically significant immunodeficiency. A chronic generalized immune activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion loss of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. However it is still unknown whether reducing immune activation will restore CD4 T cell counts and leading to immune reconstitution in chronic HIV infection. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been demonstrated to decrease immune responses of the host and can suppress inflammation in HIV-infected non-responders. Here the investigators propose a hypothesis that MSC can reduce immune activation which subsequently lead to the restoration of CD4 T-cell counts dependent on dose of transfused MSCs in HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT01213186
HIV,Post-Exposure Prophylaxis in Health Care Workers, Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) with a regimen of Truvada + Kaletra among health care workers (HCWs) at Henry Ford Hospital.

HIV,Pharmacokinetic Study of Raltegravir in Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Hepatitis C Virus (HIV/VHC) Coinfected Patients With Advanced (Child-Pugh C) Hepatic Cirrhosis, Raltegravir is the first integrase inhibitor used in humans. It has been shown to be highly efficacious and well tolerated in phase III clinical trials in multidrug experienced human immunodeficiency virus(HIV)-infected patients as well as initial therapy in untreated patients. Pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adult subjects indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of the drug is glucuronidation mediated by UGT1A1 with a minor contribution of renal excretion of unchanged parent compound. Unlike CYP-based metabolism glucuronidation is generally found to be relatively unaffected by hepatic disease. A single dose pharmacokinetic study of raltegravir in patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency (Steigbigel et al. 2008) found no clinically important effect on the drug pharmacokinetic profile with no dosage adjustment being necessary. The liver safety and tolerability of boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) has been evaluated in human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus (HIV/HCV) coinfected patients with advanced liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis) (Hermida JM et al. 4th IAS: Sidney 2007). Similar to Raltegravir ATV is also mainly metabolized by conjugation through UGT1A1. There is an urgent need for potent and efficacious ARV drugs with a clean safety liver profile even in patients with severe liver disease. The investigators hypothesized that pharmacokinetics will not be altered in HIV/HCV patients with advanced (Child-Pugh grade C) cirrhosis or in those with no histologic liver damage.    ,NCT01289951

Tripterygium Wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) has been demonstrated to decrease immune activation of the host and can suppress inflammation in human diseases. Here the investigators propose a hypothesis that TwHF can reduce immune over-activation which subsequently leads to the restoration of CD4 T-cell counts and immune reconstitution in HIV-infected immune non-responders.    ,NCT01666990
HIV,Body Image in Youth With HIV, This is an observational study that seeks to gather information about perceptions of body image through the use of a one-time questionnaire completed by participants at the time of study enrollment. Effective management of Human Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has become possible through the use of Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART). As a result of more successful treatment options HIV/AIDS has transitioned from a terminal illness to one which is treated as a chronic condition. One particular group that has been impacted tremendously by HIV in the United States is the adolescent population. As youth are living longer with HIV/AIDS clinicians and researchers are beginning to examine ways in which the disease can affect one's physical health mental health and other psychosocial factors. Research emerging involving adults with HIV/AIDS has suggested that increased attention to and negative views of one's body image may be found at a higher rate in this group. To our knowledge very few studies have examined this relationship in adolescents with HIV.    ,NCT01673750
HIV,Brain Imaging for HIV-Associated Thinking and Mood Disorders, Background: - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection appears to cause problems with blood vessel function. These problems may add to some thinking and mood disorders found in people with HIV infection.

HIV,Mater-Bronx Rapid HIV Testing Project., In the M-BRiHT study we aim to implement a programme of opportunistic HIV screening in the Emergency Department Mater Misericordiae University Hospital. We hypothesize that such a programme will be acceptable in an Irish setting. We also wish to study the factors that influence test completion or acceptance. We will utilise informative interactive video media via a touch-screen tablet device to provide pre-test counselling and then offer rapid minimally invasive testing with a cotton-bud type swab of the buccal mucosa. In doing so we will to determine absolute numbers of those attending the ED who consent to watching the interactive information video about rapid HIV test screening. We will describe the absolute number and proportion of those who watch the interactive video who subsequently proceed to have the rapid HIV test. The primary aim is to determine the cultural gender and ethnic factors which influence the completion of such rapid HIV testing with the future objective of maximising test completion in this crucial public health area.    ,NCT01778374

If successful the impact on HIV care will be immense and could transform the delivery of HIV self-management and adherence education by overcoming barriers of geographic isolation transportation stigma and confidentiality in this vulnerable group.    ,NCT01786148
HIV,DRV/r + RPV QD: Efficacy and Toxicity Reduction, Clinical approach to HIV infection treatment is based on the use of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) and recent national and international guidelines for guiding HIV therapy recommend the use of triple-combination therapy using antiretrovirals with 2 nucleos(t)ide inhibitors [N(n)RTI] as backbone plus a third drug to be chosen among a boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) a nonnucleoside inhibitor (NNRTI) or an integrase inhibitor (II). In spite of evident efficacy of HAART as demonstrated by survival increasing long term side effects as for example the impact on renal function remain principal problem. In patient with risk factor for renal disease a reduction of eGRF (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) between 90 and 60 mL/min/173 m2 could be already considered as a risk condition [12]. Efficacy of HAART with increase of media survival and the parallel decrease of mortality has underlined the necessity to reflect on long term HAART effects [3]. There are many evidences of HAART-related toxicity that in spite of the necessity of a life-saving therapy focus on the additional costs of this situation in terms of health as well as in terms of economic costs. Particular attention has been focused on the impact of some drugs on renal function as tenofovir especially on tubule without forgetting the modification of lipid and bone metabolisms. According to further studies which have evidenced the potential of some recently introduced molecules [45] the investigators had the need to realize a study to deepen the feasibility of a dual-therapy that permit to exclude NRTIs from the backbone with the aim to prevent NRTIs-related long-term toxicity. The investigators have designed a prospective randomized controlled trial open-label with a duration of 96 weeks to compare the efficacy of a dual-therapy based on rilpivirine 25mg plus darunavir 800mg/ritonavir 100mg QD in HIV-positive subjects with suppressed viremia from at least 3 months. In fact there are a few data about association of these drugs which it has been shown to be safe well tolerated and with a strong pharmacological synergy without nucleos(t)idic backbone while the necessity to minimize the costs toxicity-related is becoming increasingly compelling. According to clinical experience and literature data the investigators hope this study shows positive results in term of immune-virological efficacy as well as in term of decrease of VACS index - a complex parameter which has the purpose to quantify general organic decay - and markers of lipid and bone metabolism in group which receives dual-therapy versus the group with standard therapy.    ,NCT01792570

HIV,Efficacy Study of Different Laboratory Management Strategies and Drug Regimens in HIV-infected Children in Africa, The two original objectives were to determine in HIV-infected children initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART):   1. Whether clinically driven monitoring (CDM) will have a similar outcome in terms of disease progression or death as routine laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM) for toxicity (haematology/biochemistry) and efficacy (CD4)?   2. Whether induction with four drugs from two ART classes followed by maintenance with three drugs after 36 weeks be more effective than a continuous non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-based triple drug regimen in terms of CD4 and clinical outcome? Two secondary objectives were to determine   3. Whether changing from twice daily lamivudine+abacavir to once daily lamivudine+abacavir after 48 weeks on ART will have a similar outcome in terms of virological suppression and will result in improvements in adherence to ART?   4. Whether stopping daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in children over 3 years of age who have been on ART for at least 96 weeks has a similar outcome in terms of hospitalisation or death as continuing daily cotrimoxazole?    ,NCT02028676
HIV,Pediatric Urgent Start of Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART), Design: Randomized clinical trial involving hospitalized HIV-1 infected children. Children will be randomized to randomized to urgent (<48 hours) versus early antiretroviral therapy (7-14 days). This trial will be unblinded. Population: Hospitalized HIV-1 infected children who are antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve ??12 years of age. Sample size: 360 children will be randomized (180 per arm). Treatment: All infants will be treated with ART according to World Health Organization (WHO) and Kenyan national guidelines. Study duration: Enrollment into the study will occur over the course of 36-48 months and each infant will be routinely followed for a maximum of 6 months. Study site: Kenyan hospitals. Primary hypothesis: HIV-1 infected children hospitalized with severe co-infection either may be unsalvageable due to too far advanced immunosuppression/co-infection or may benefit from urgent ART. Secondary hypotheses: Urgent ART during an acute infection could potentially result in increased risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) or drug toxicities/interactions. Specific aims:   1. To compare the 6 month all-cause mortality rate incidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and incidence of drug toxicity in HIV-1 infected children (??12 years old) presenting to hospital with a serious infection randomized to urgent (<48 hours) versus early ART (7-14 days).   2. To determine co-factors for mortality IRIS and drug toxicity. Potential cofactors will include: baseline weight-for-age height-for-age weight-for-height (Z-scores) CD4 HIV-1 RNA type of co-infection age rate of viral load and CD4 change following ART immune activation markers pathogen and HIV-1 specific immune responses. Secondary aim: To determine etiologies of IRIS and to compare immune reconstitution to HIV TB EBV and CMV following ART overall and in each trial arm.    ,NCT02063880
HIV,DVD-based HIV/HCV Prevention Intervention for Drug-Involved Latino Criminal Justice Clients, The purpose of the study are the following: 1) Pilot test and conduct baseline and 3 month follow up assessments to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the DVD-based HIV/HCV intervention by randomly assigning 210 Latino corrections-involved outpatient abuse treatment clients to either the experimental intervention or to a wait list control group; and 2) to evaluate both participant and interventionist acceptability of this novel DVD-based intervention. They study hypothesis are the following:   1. participants in the intervention condition will report greater reductions in sexual risk behaviors (e.g. unprotected sexual contact) from baseline to 3 month follow-up compared to the control group;   2. participants will report greater reductions in drug risk behaviors (e.g. sharing injection equipment drug use during sex) from baseline to 3 month follow-up compared to the control group;   3. participants who report more HIV prevention information motivation and behavioral skills will report fewer sexual risk behaviors.    ,NCT02116179
HIV,Medication Adherence in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Although effective treatments are currently available to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) the retrovirus leading to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) strict adherence to the treatment regimen is required. Nonadherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens is well documented in individuals with HIV. This is especially true for adolescents and young adults (AYA) where rates of adherence range from 20 to 100%. Nonadherence has significant implications for subsequent treatment response and health outcomes including poor virologic response development of drug resistance and mortality. Of note previous research has suggested that every 1% increase in nonadherence is related to a 2% increased likelihood of detectable viral load (VL) in youth with behaviorally acquired HIV. Furthermore higher VL is the most salient variable related to increased risk of virus transmission. Thus nonadherence to HAART is a significant public health issue. The objective of the proposed research plan is to systematically examine an individualized behavioral intervention targeting HAART nonadherence in AYAs initiating HAART. The current intervention will support AYA participation in brief staff-delivered instruction in adherence-promotion skills. Individualized behavioral analysis and motivational interviewing will be applied to provide effective solutions for current barriers to HAART adherence before and after HAART initiation as recommended by the Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents.    ,NCT02119390
HIV,Improving Drug Adherence Among Adolescents in Uganda Using SMS Reminders, In this project the investigators develop and test a short message service (SMS) intervention based on the Information Motivation and Behavior skills (IMB) model. Reminding Adolescents To Adhere (RATA) prompts youths at two clinics in Uganda to take their medications and offers social support via weekly text messages. The investigators propose to adapt their previous successful SMS-intervention to the specific needs of youths and to evaluate the relative effectiveness of one-way versus two-way text messages (where two-way messages allow youths to respond to messages and we hypothesize that this may increase perceived social support that may be important for youth populations). We will also test the effectiveness of SMS messages over the longer-term (2 years) for which currently no information is available.    ,NCT02128087
HIV,Relationship of Tenofovir With HIV-1 Suppression in ex Vivo Tissue in Adolescents, Microbicides are topical medicines that can prevent infection by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Microbicide medicine has yet to be studied in adolescents a key group that is becoming infected with HIV all over the world. From past research we know that at different ages people experience age-related changes in their bodies that can cause differences in how they process medications. In this study gut tissue samples (or gut biopsies) from 12 HIV-negative volunteers will be collected. These pieces of tissue will be infected with HIV in the laboratory to develop a model that can be used to test certain drugs against the HIV infection. We can use this tissue to test a drug called tenofovir against HIV infection. We will determine whether this drug can decrease HIV infection in the gut biopsies. In this study we will also measure HIV levels and the levels of tenofovir in gut and blood samples in 12 people who are already taking this drug. This information can determine whether levels of drug found in the gut can protect it from HIV. The results can be compared to other age groups of adolescents and adults. Subjects will undergo a common procedure called a lower endoscopy (this can be a colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy) to obtain gut biopsy samples. The central hypothesis is that tissue drug profiles of tenofovir (TFV) and its active component tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tissue infectibility vary between younger (10-14 years old) versus older adolescents (18-21 years old) and that both differ from adults (>21 years). Specifically younger HIV positive adolescents will have lower levels of tissue tenofovir compared to older HIV positive adolescents and adults in an age-dependent manner. Additionally biopsies from younger HIV negative adolescents will have: 1) higher rates of infection compared to biopsies from older HIV negative adolescents infected with a lower dose of virus; and 2) lower percent suppression of tissue infectivity compared to biopsies from older HIV negative adolescents using low dose tenofovir.    ,NCT02134431

HIV,The Tolerability of and Adherence to Dolutegravir With Co-formulated Tenofovir-emtricitabine for HIV Non-occupational Post-exposure Prophylaxis, This study aims to describe the proportion of participants with non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (NPEP) failure defined as NPEP non-completion (including loss to follow-up) at week 4 or primary HIV infection at week 4 or 12 excluding those participants who should and do cease study drug because:   1. The participant is found to be HIV-infected (study drugs will be ceased until the genotype of the infecting strain is determined)   2. The source is found to be HIV-uninfected The primary study objectives are:   1. To describe on-drug adherence and regimen completion rates of 28 days of NPEP using dolutegravir (DTG) with co-formulated emtricitabine-tenofovir (FTC-TDF)   2. To describe the safety of 28 days of non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (NPEP) using dolutegravir with co-formulated emtricitabine-tenofovir The study is a multi-site prospective open-label non-randomized trial. One-hundred (100) eligible participants will receive dolutegravir (one tablet) with co-formulated emtricitabine-tenofovir two tablets once daily for 28 days based on one of the following exposures:   1. receptive anal intercourse with a source known to be HIV-infected; or   2. receptive anal intercourse with a source of unknown HIV status; or   3. insertive anal intercourse with a source known to be HIV-infected There will be 7 study visits over a 12-week period. Follow-up post NPEP is for 8 weeks i.e. to week-12 post-exposure. Any participant who is intolerant of dolutegravir will be managed at the investigator's discretion.    ,NCT02211690
HIV,Comparison of Virologic and Immunologic Responses to Raltegravir and Dolutegravir in the Gastrointestinal Tract of HIV-Positive Adults, This is a Phase IV open label observational study to compare the gastrointestinal tissue concentrations inflammatory response and viral replication of two integrase-inhibitors raltegravir and dolutegravir in HIV-infected volunteers who are virologically suppressed in blood plasma.

HIV,The Dolutegravir Antiretroviral Mono-Therapy for HIV Trial, 48-week open label randomized phase IV investigator initiated intervention study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether HIV-1 suppression can be maintained by DTG monotherapy in HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed patients on cART. 104 adults fulfilling the in and exclusion criteria and on stable cART will be randomized over 2 investigational arms. The first arm will contain the direct switch population. This population will switch directly from stable cART to Dolutegravir mono-therapy on baseline visit. The second arm will contain the delayed-switch population. This group will switch from stable cART to Dolutegravir monotherapy 24 weeks after baseline visit. The main goal is to investigate if Dolutegravir mono-therapy could be non-inferior to cART in virological suppressed HIV-1 infected adults. If a interim analysis (performed when 40 patients on dolutegravir monotherapy have passed week 12) shows that it is safe to continue the study an additional 30 patients will be included on top of the 104 patients needed for the primary endpoint analysis. In contrast to the primary endpoint population these additional 30 patients will have a CD4 nadir <200 but a CD4 >350 at the time of the screening visit. Besides that these 30 patients will have to fulfill all other in and exclusion criteria of the primary endpoint population (specifically a viral load never >100.000). These 30 patients are part of a pilot study looking at the possibility to broaden the eligible population in a future larger randomized clinical trial.    ,NCT02401828

HIV,Improving Adherence Among HIV+ Rwandan Youth: A TI-CBTe Indigenous Leader Model, Like most of sub-Saharan Africa Rwandan youth are the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic accounting for 40% of new infections. Antiretroviral (ART) adherence is a global health priority but Rwandan youth are more than twice as likely to be on second line therapy than adults and with a median population age of 18.7 years old adherence is essential for Rwanda's future. Resources to provide youth-centered medical and psychosocial care are limited in Rwanda and young people with HIV face many obstacles to adherence namely the long-term consequences of genocide depression and gender-based violence as well as logistical issues negative attitudes and insufficient parent/caregiver support. Preliminary data underscore the utility of culturally-adapted trauma-informed cognitive behavioral therapy (TI-CBT) in reducing depression and traumatic distress among youth and adults in Rwanda. This project proposes a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test and compare the efficacy of adherence-enhanced Trauma Informed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (i.e. TI-CBTe) to usual care in increasing ART adherence among Rwandan youth from two clinics caring for the largest number of youth with HIV in Rwanda. This proposal answers a compelling need for innovative programs to increase ART adherence among HIV+ youth. If effective the study will build Rwanda's capacity to provide much needed services; and involvement by the Rwanda Biomedical Center will ensure wide dissemination.    ,NCT02464423

HIV,Impact of Pre-ART Blood CD4+ T Cell Level on the Rectal Reservoir in Long-term HIV-1 Treated Men, Although combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically improved quality of life and lifespan of HIV infected individuals it still fails to eliminate viral reservoirs. The Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) is the largest reservoir of HIV-1 as it harbors most of HIV target cells as activated memory Cluster of differentiation (CD)4+/CCR5+ T cells. Intestinal T and B cells express α4β7 integrin a gut mucosal homing receptor which binds to gp120 HIV-1 envelope facilitating the infection of intestinal T cells and the early establishment of the gut HIV reservoir. Intensive viral replication in the GALT leads to an early impairment of mucosal immunity due to the severe CD4+ T cells depletion that could be also explained by a lack of recruitment in the gut. Among T cells interleukin-(IL-)17 secreting CD4+ T cells (Th17) are particularly depleted during HIV infection. This depletion could be associated with HIV progression since these cells play a crucial role in the maintenance of mucosal immunity. A dysbalance of the Th17/Treg ratio may reflect the loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. These damages are responsible for an increase in microbial translocation which is associated with immune activation and progression to AIDS. Several recent studies have shown that cART initiation during acute or early HIV-1 infection reduces HIV DNA reservoir size and improves immune reconstitution in blood. Post-treatment controllers who started long-term cART early after HIV infection have very low levels of HIV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells similarly to elite controllers. Unlike most HIV-infected individuals they maintain an undetectable plasmatic viral load after several years of cART interruption suggesting that a weak reservoir is a prerequisite to achieve a functional cure. By extrapolation it could be hypothesized that the gut viral reservoir is also decreased and that mucosal immunity is restored when cART is initiated during primary phase of infection. The gut viral reservoir begins to form within the first days after HIV exposure and grows during acute HIV infection. Similarly intestinal T cells are depleted very early after infection due to high viral replication host immune response and bystander effects. Most studies also concluded that long-term and optimal treatment can't fully restore mucosal immunity. These observations led us to study the impact of time of cART start on the size of viral reservoir and on immune reconstitution in the gut. For this we analyzed the virological and immunological characteristics of the rectal HIV reservoir of long-term treated patients regarding their blood CD4+ T cells count at the time of cART initiation.    ,NCT02526940
HIV,Platelets Study: Influence of the Antiretroviral Treatment on the Platelet Physiology During HIV Infection, HIV infection is associated with an immune activation and an inflammatory response - despite an active antiretroviral therapy - which may lead notably but not exclusively to cardiovascular diseases. It has been shown that the use of Protease Inhibitors (PI) instead of Non Nucleosidic Inhibitors (NNRTI) may increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Platelets may play a role in the occurrence of the inflammatory state: they contain big amounts of chemokines growth factors and adhesion proteins. Today the contribution of platelets to the inflammatory state associated with HIV infection has been little studied. Thus it has been shown that platelets in HIV patients are able to release interleukin (IL)-18. The group has shown with others that the platelet function could be altered during HIV infection. Inversely it doesn't know how antiretroviral therapy interacts with platelets. The aim of the study is to evaluate according to the antiretroviral therapy the impact on the platelets activation markers.    ,NCT02532348

HIV,Prospective Evaluation of HIV Patients Using Non-invasive Methods for Estimation of Liver Fibrosis and Steatosis, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a major global health issue with up to 40 million people infected worldwide. Due to highly active antiretroviral therapy mortality related to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been reducing in the last decades. However liver disease remains as an important cause of severe complications and death. Hepatic fibrosis progression is the main responsible for liver-related outcomes in HIV-positive patients. Co-infection by hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly prevalence in HIV patients. Chronic viral co-infection induces faster liver fibrosis progression compared to mono-infected HIV. However published data have been reporting presence of significant liver fibrosis in HIV without HBV or HCV infection. This might be related to direct action of HIV in hepatocytes or association with others factors such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is associated with metabolic factors such as obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus. However antiretroviral drugs may induce abnormal body fat distribution (lipodistrophy) and insulin resistance playing an important role on this process. Liver biopsy has been historically considered as the gold standard to evaluate liver injury. However this painful method presents several limitations. Therefore several non-invasive methods for estimation of liver fibrosis such as biomarkers (APRI FIB-4 FibroTest and FibroMeter) and transient elastography by Fibroscan have been developed as an alternative to liver biopsy. The diagnostic performance and prognostic value of biomarkers and transient elastography have been validated in patients with chronic liver diseases. However few data are available in HIV patients especially in those without chronic viral co-infection. Therefore patients medical doctors and scientific community will be beneficiated by the future application of non-invasive methods for estimation of liver injury in clinical practice in HIV patients.    ,NCT02542020
HIV,A Pilot Study of MONOtherapy of DOlutegravir in HIV-1 Virologically Suppressed Patients, Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend a combination of drugs for the maintenance of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Simplification is considered critical to further scale-up of treatment to support retention in care and to reduce costs. Dolutegravir is a once daily integrase inhibitor that shows very good tolerability efficacy and distinctive resistance profile. The researchers aim at investigating the feasibility of dolutegravir monotherapy in maintenance therapy. Briefly 10 virologically suppressed patients for at least six months on conventional triple ART of dolutegravir plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) will be switched to dolutegravir monotherapy for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the number of patients completing 24 weeks of dolutegravir monotherapy without experiencing virological failure.    ,NCT02572947

HIV,Safety and Efficacy of Allogenic Adoptive Cell Therpy for Immune Reconstitution in Chronic HIV-1 Infected Patients, Chronic HIV-1 infection is generally characterized by progressive CD4+ T cell depletion associated with risk of opportunistic infections. In clinical about 20% of patients who exhibit stable viral suppression by HAART still fail to achieve sufficient immune reconstitution and often experience an increased risk of opportunistic infections. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized donor peripheral-blood stem cells based on HLA-mismatched allogeneic transplantation have been demonstrated to boost host immunity against tumor and promote hemopoiesis without acute graft-versus-host disease. Thus it may represent a novel treatment as allogenic adoptive cell therapy (AACT). Here the investigators propose a hypothesis that AACT can promote hemopoiesis in bone marrow and attenuate immune-mediated inflammation which subsequently lead to the restoration of CD4 T-cell counts and reconstitution of host immunity in HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT02648516
HIV,Safety and Efficacy of Allogenic Adoptive Cell Therpy for Immunodeficiency in Chronic HIV-1 Infected Patients, HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells that eventually leads to clinically significant immunodeficiency. Severely immunosuppressed patients often experience an increased risk of opportunistic infection. A chronic generalized immune activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion loss of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. However it is still unknown whether reducing immune activation will restore CD4 T cell counts and leading to the restoration of immunodeficiency in chronic HIV infection.Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized donor peripheral-blood stem cells based on HLA mismatched allogeneic transplantation have been demonstrated to boost host immunity against tumor attenuate immune-mediated inflammation promote hemopoiesis without acute graft-versus-host disease. Thus it may represent a novel treatment as adoptive therapy of allogenic adoptive cell therapy (AACT).

HIV,HIV Drug Switch Followed by HCV Therapy in HIV-HCV Co-Infection, This is an prospective open label pilot study conducted over 32 weeks. A total of 25 eligible participants who are infected with HCV and HIV will be recruited from 2 Canadian HIV Trials Network (CTN) sites (Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and McGill University Health Centre) This study is looking into the effectiveness of a combination of Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir Alafenamide Single Tablet Regimen (E/C/F/TAF STR) for HIV treatment and Harvoni for HCV treatment . This study will assess the effect that the study drug has on the metabolism of sugar the changes in fat in the bloodstream and other metabolic changes. Metabolism is the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food you eat. This study may provide information on the impact of liver fibrosis (scarring of liver tissues) on metabolic changes before during and after HCV antiviral therapy. Drug-drug interactions (DDI) DDI between E/C/F/TAF and LPV-SOF have been well evaluated and no clinically significant interactions have been identified. A switch to E/C/F/TAF in the context of LPV-SOF HCV antiviral treatment preparation may be particularly beneficial because of its:   1. favorable side effect profile   2. once daily STR formulation   3. known DDI profile with LPV-SOF   4. neutral effect on liver fibrosis   5. improved kidney and bone safety profile with the use of TAF Conduct of this study is justified as it:   1. Assesses a minimal pill count and dosing frequency strategy of co-treatment of HIV and HCV using well tolerated medications with an excellent safety profile and known DDI profile.   2. Provides additional safety data for TAF in the HIV-HCV co-infected population.   3. Quantifies adherence and identifies obstacles to full adherence in this population. There is a paucity of data related to DAA adherence in licensing studies.   4. Provides real-world safety and efficacy data to support the public funding for LPV-SOF DAA therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected populations.   5. Provides preliminary data on the immunologic and metabolic consequences of HCV clearance in HIV-HCV co-infection   6. As a pilot study the information gathered will inform the feasibility of future clinical trials evaluating novel treatment strategies for HIV-HCV co-infected patients.    ,NCT02660905

HIV,BRIDGE: Improving HIV Service Delivery for People Who Inject Drugs, Scaling up integrated cost-efficient HIV services for people who inject drugs (PWID) in Needle Syringe Programs (NSPs) is urgently needed in Kazakhstan where only one-third of the estimated 19000 HIV-positive PWID are ever linked to HIV care and only 10% initiate ART with 4% achieving viral suppression. The study's aim is to evaluate the implementation effectiveness and sustainability of an integrated HIV service model in 24 NSPs located in 4 Kazakhstani cities. This model will employ highly effective strategies that will include peer-driven recruitment of PWID in NSPs using social network strategies (SNS) integrating rapid HIV testing in NSPs with HIV Care Clinic nurses and linking HIV positive PWID in NSPs to HIV care using the ARTAS (Anti-Retroviral Treatment and Access to Services) case management model. Findings will have important public health implications for improving HIV service delivery for PWID in the Central Asian region and other countries with injection driven epidemics.    ,NCT02796027

HIV,Factors Associated With Late HIV Diagnosis in Grampian: an Epidemiological Study, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major global health concern which has resulted in an estimated 39 million deaths world-wide. Although it is now a treatable medical condition there is still avoidable morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection in the UK. Late diagnosis (CD4 count of <350 cells/mm3 or AIDS-defining illness irrespective of CD4 count) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality increased risk of transmission impaired response to antiretroviral therapy and increased healthcare costs. In Grampian 49% of patients were diagnosed late between 1984 and 2011. Therefore the aim of the study is to determine the factors associated with late HIV diagnosis in Grampian between 2009 and 2014 to ascertain whether diagnoses could have been made earlier. The study constitutes a secondary data analysis. Individuals newly diagnosed with HIV between January 2009 and December 2014 were identified from a Health Protection Scotland (HPS) database. The majority of outcome data were extracted from the existing HPS database. Missing data were collected via a retrospective review of patient case-notes laboratory reports and an electronic patient management system. Patients were classified as early or late diagnosis and comparisons were made between the groups using statistical tests. The study sought to provide a basis for recommendations for improvement of information and services to facilitate earlier HIV diagnosis in Grampian.    ,NCT02804724

HIV,Supporting Adolescents to Adhere - an Intervention Using Airtime Rewards Allocated by a Prize Drawing, This study is an extension of Reminding Adolescents to Adhere (RATA) (Unique protocol ID: 1R01HD074925-01). Participants for SATA will be recruited during the RATA month 24 exit survey. Participants will be randomized 1:1:1 into either one of two intervention group (receiving the weekly messages and a chance to draw a prize at each clinic visit based on either a fixed adherence level of 90% or a self-chosen one of at least 80% as further detailed below) or the control group that receives the existing RATA intervention consisting of weekly motivational messages and the chance to get mobile airtime rewards conditional on responding. Doing so will allow the investigators to cleanly evaluate the impact of these additional adherence-based lotteries and guarantees that those who have been in the control group receiving standard of care in the first 24 months of the RATA intervention will also receive an intervention for reasons of fairness.    ,NCT02918838
HIV,Digital Star: HIV Prevention for Youth in Mental Health Treatment, Teenagers in mental health treatment are at greater risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. This greater risk comes from many factors some of which are related to poor emotion regulation and low self-confidence. There is a need for an HIV prevention program specifically for these at-risk teens. The goal of this study is to develop a computerized HIV prevention study tailored to adolescents in mental health treatment. The first part of the study will develop core sessions of D*STAR. It will do this by using focus group feedback from approximately 15 adolescents in mental health treatment and approximately 10 parents of youth in mental health treatment and mental health treatment center staff. Feedback on D*STAR prototype sessions will also be collected from two individual interviews with approximately 15 youth in mental health treatment. Core sessions will then be reviewed in an open trial with approximately 30 adolescents. The second part of the study will develop and refine digital versions of the remaining sessions of STAR and a digital general health promotion intervention. It will do this by using focus group feedback from approximately 20 adolescents in mental health treatment and approximately 10 community advisory board members which include variety of staff from mental health treatment settings such as administrators supervisors therapists health teachers at therapeutic schools clinicians at day hospitals and day treatment programs parents of youth in mental health treatment and from relevant community organizations such as those serving lesbian gay bisexual transgender and questioning youth. Feedback on D*STAR prototype sessions will also be collected from two individual interviews with approximately 20 youth in mental health treatment. All developed sessions (from both Phase I and Phase II) will then be reviewed in an open trial with approximately 20 adolescents. A randomized control trial (RCT) will then be conducted to compare D*STAR to a time matched digital general health promotion intervention among approximately 120 adolescents. For the pilot and RCT phases assessments will be administered prior to randomization immediately following the last intervention session and at one month post-intervention (pilot study) or at three month post-intervention (RCT).    ,NCT02921841

The objective of the intervention is to have older mentor mothers who themselves were pregnant adolescents to mentor younger adolescent mothers. Mentor mothers will provide ongoing psychosocial support help navigate re-admission to school and help facilitate access to an existing State-sponsored cash transfer the child support grant (CSG) in the early postpartum period. Our combination social protection program will enhance resilience of young adolescent mothers to facilitate their return to school and thereby reduce HIV risk. The investigators will evaluate the efficacy of the intervention using a pre-test post-test randomized controlled trial design. Participants in the intervention will receive the Mentoring Adolescent Mothers At School (MAMAS) intervention and standard postpartum care. Those in the control arm will receive standard postpartum care. Additionally for those participants randomized to the intervention arm mentor mothers will use participatory visual methods (e.g. photovoice cell-films drawings) as part of the intervention itself. Last among those participants randomized to the intervention arm and who return for their 9-month assessment the investigators will conduct 20 in-depth interviews to understand the process of resilience development from their perspective.

HIV,Impact of Recombinant Human Growth Hormone on HIV Persistence, Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the health of more than 18 million people infected with HIV by controlling viral replication AIDS and non-AIDS events and by reducing the risk of transmission. However the existence of latent viral reservoirs in long-lived memory CD4 T cells remains a hurdle to curing HIV infection; consequently patients must remain on ART for the rest of their lives. Recently a more realistic approach under limelight is to identify strategies leading to a functional cure which is defined as the natural control of viral reservoir by the host. Use of recombinant human growth hormone has been shown to improve immune function by several mechanisms. This study hypothesizes that treatment with recombinant human growth hormone will decrease the size of the replication competent HIV reservoir in HIV-infected immune-reconstituted individuals. The specific study objectives include:   -  To evaluate the effect of recombinant human growth hormone administration for 48 weeks on the size of the replication competent HIV reservoir   -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of recombinant human growth hormone administration for 48 weeks in HIV-infected individuals on suppressive ART. For this purpose the investigators will add recombinant human growth hormone treatment for the patients receiving stable ART. Approximately 22 participants will be enrolled in this study at the Chronic Viral Illness Service of the McGill University Health Centre (Montreal Canada) which will last about 52 weeks. Participants will be treated with recombinant human growth hormone for a total of 48 weeks. The initial recombinant human growth hormone dose will be 3 mg/day (30-40 µg/kg/d) for 24 weeks administered by subcutaneous injection on an outpatient basis followed by dose reduction to 1.5 mg/day for the final 24 weeks of the treatment period also conducted on an outpatient basis. The study inclusion criteria include male and female participants ??8 and <40 years of age with an undetectable viral load (the quantity of the HIV virus in the blood must be less than 50 copies/ml) during last 24 months and with a CD4 T-cell count ??50 cells/mm3 obtained within 30 days prior to study entry. The findings from this study will contribute to the development of novel strategies to eradicate HIV.    ,NCT03091374
HIV,Impact of Integrated HIV/NCD Screening on HIV Testing Uptake and Engagement in HIV Care In Kisarawe Tanzania, This study focuses on the integration of HIV and NCD screening and care. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the intervention strategy in Kisarawe District Tanzania a rural area 40 KM southwest of Dar es Salaam. The study will match two similar HIV care and treatment centers (CTC) in the District one of which will be randomized to receive the enhanced intervention which will integrate diabetes (DM) and hypertension (HTN) screening with the existing HIV testing program and integrate care for DM and HTN into the HIV care program. Comparisons of the community HIV testing rates in the two communities engagement in HIV care among those testing positive and 24-month retention in HIV care will be assessed among a cohort of 89 newly enrolled patients per community. Specifically the aims are to determine:   1. Whether integrating DM and HTN screening with HIV testing will increase the uptake of community-level HIV testing.   2. If integrating DM/HTN care with HIV care enhances engagement in HIV care.   3. Whether integration of DM/HTN care with HIV care enhances retention in HIV care for those newly enrolled in HIV care.   4. The cost-effectiveness of integrating NCD screening and care with HIV screening and care with regard to the incremental cost per HIV infected client engaged in HIV care and cost per newly enrolled HIV client retained in HIV care over 24-months.    ,NCT03098654

HIV,A Study of the Neurological Effects of Adding Raltegravir to HAART Regimen in Patients With HIV," HIV related cognitive impairment still occurs despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HIV disease affects the brain in 20-40% of patients with advancing HIV disease leading to varying degrees of cognitive impairment recently termed HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HAND may occur in patients who are virally suppressed in both blood and CSF. Patients with HIV Associated Neurological Disorders (HAND) who are virally suppressed in both their blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) whilst on a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen may have significant cognitive improvement with HAART intensification with the medication Raltegravir; compared to those who remain on their existing regimen. This study will be a prospective interventional randomised and unblinded controlled clinical trial. The aim of this study will be to determine whether HAART intensification with the medication Raltegravir leads to significant improvement in HIV associated neurological disorders (HAND). Patients with the recent progression (within 6 months) of HAND (validated by neuropsychological assessment) on HAART who are virally suppressed (<50 copies per ml) in blood and CSF will be randomised to have their existing HAART regimen intensified with raltegravir 400mg twice daily or not. The control arm will remain on their medication regimen as prescribed. The target is to enrol 110 patients into the control group and 110 patients into the Raltegravir intensification group. Patients will undergo baseline neuropsychological testing MRI blood tests and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) tests (via a lumbar puncture). The methods used to determine the effectiveness of adding Raltegravir will include further neuropsychological testing at 6 months; and neuropsychological testing MRI and CSF assessment at 12 months. Neuropsychological testing completed at 6 and 12 months will be completed by a ""blind assessor"" in that they will have no knowledge of which arm (treatment or control) the participant is enrolled in.

The decision of the Antiretroviral medication regimen to be used in such a case will be determined by the managing physician. At the end of the study protocol (12 months) the patient's HAART therapy will be managed by their primary physician.    ",NCT01448486
HIV,A Study of the Neurological Effects of Adding Maraviroc to HAART Regimen in Patients With HIV (HANDmac)," HIV related cognitive impairment still occurs despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HIV disease affects the brain in 20-40% of patients with advancing HIV disease; leading to varying degrees of cognitive impairment recently termed HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HAND may occur in patients who are virally suppressed in both blood and CSF. Patients with HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) who are virally suppressed in both their blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) whilst on a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen may have significant cognitive improvement with HAART intensification with the medication Maraviroc; compared to those who remain on their existing regimen. This study will be a prospective interventional randomised and unblinded controlled clinical trial. The aim of this study will be to determine whether HAART intensification with the medication Maraviroc leads to significant improvement in HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Patients with the recent progression (within 6 months) of HAND (validated by neuropsychological assessment) on HAART who are virally suppressed (<50 copies per ml) in blood and CSF will be randomised to have their existing HAART regimen intensified with Maraviroc or not. The control arm will remain on their medication regimen as prescribed. The target is to enrol 70 patients into the control group and 70 patients into the Maraviroc intensification group. Patients will undergo baseline neuropsychological testing MRI blood tests and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests (via a lumbar puncture). The methods used to determine the effectiveness of adding Maraviroc will include further neuropsychological assessment at 6 months and neuropsychological assessment MRI and CSF assessment again at 12 months. Neuropsychological testing completed at 6 and 12 months will be completed by a ""blind assessor"" in that they will have no knowledge of which arm (treatment or control) the participant is enrolled in. An evaluation (neuropsychological testing) will be performed should the patient deteriorate during the course of the study as recognised by the patient's managing physician. At the end of the study protocol (12 months) the patient's HAART therapy will be managed by their primary physician.    ",NCT01449006

HIV,Multi-level Determinants of Starting ART Late: Aim 2, The availability of HIV care and treatment programs is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa. However more than half the patients who need HIV medicines are still not receiving this antiretroviral therapy (ART) and this can lead to early death from AIDS. One of the problems in this region is that patients start ART late after the HIV disease is very advanced. This results in high death rates soon after ART initiation. The way clinic-level factors such as the way services and referrals are organized how referrals are regarded counseling messages and record-keeping contribute to late ART initiation is unclear. As the second phase of a 3-phase NIH-sponsored project this study will identify clinic-level enablers and barriers to timely enrollment into HIV care and ART initiation. A cross-sectional qualitative study will be conducted at 4 selected HIV care and treatment clinics and the health facilities in which they are located in Ethiopia. Data will be collected using 4 methods:   1. Data abstraction   2. Key informant interviews with clinic personnel   3. Observation of post-test counseling sessions in the VCT clinic   4. Observation of provider-patient interactions in the care and treatment clinic Identifying modiﬁable health facility-level predictors of late ART initiation will facilitate implementation of interventions programs and policies that will increase the number of patients who enroll in HIV care and initiate ART early. Additionally results will inform the design of the third phase of the NIH-project referenced above.    ,NCT01997346
HIV,Multi-level Determinants of Starting ART Late: Aim 3, The availability of HIV care and treatment programs is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa. However more than half the patients who need HIV treatment are still not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). This can lead to early death from AIDS. Additionally many patients start ART late after the HIV disease is very advanced. This results in high death rates soon after starting ART. The factors that contribute to late ART initiation are still unclear. This study will identify factors that help patients to enroll or prevent them from enrolling into HIV care and starting ART on time. We will examine the characteristics of all patients initiating ART at study sites. We will also look at potential risk factors among patients who initiate ART late (cases) compared to patients who initiate earlier (controls) at 6 HIV care and treatment clinics in Ethiopia. Data will be collected using 2 methods:   1. Face-to-face interviews with participants using questionnaires   2. Obtaining clinical data from the electronic patient-level database Identifying factors that help patients to start or prevent them from starting ART on time will help to direct interventions programs and policies to reduce early death.    ,NCT01997359

HIV,Tesamorelin Effects on Liver Fat and Histology in HIV, Liver disease is one of the leading co-morbidities of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is present in approximately 30-40% of patients with HIV infection. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more severe form of NAFLD in which increased liver fat is also accompanied by inflammation cellular damage and fibrosis. NAFLD is most prevalent in patients who also have increased visceral adiposity and our group has previously shown that HIV-infected individuals with increased visceral adiposity generally have decreased growth hormone secretion. Tesamorelin is a growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue that increases endogenous growth hormone secretion. Tesamorelin is FDA-approved for the reduction of visceral fat in HIV-infected individuals. In a previous study treatment with tesamorelin in HIV-infected individuals selected for abdominal adiposity reduced liver fat. The current study is designed to test the effect of tesamorelin on liver fat and steatohepatitis in HIV-infected individuals who have NAFLD. The investigators hypothesize that tesamorelin will reduce liver fat and will also ameliorate the inflammation fibrosis and hepatocellular damage seen in conjunction with NASH.    ,NCT02196831
HIV,Repeat Doses of SB-728mR-T After Cyclophosphamide Conditioning in HIV-Infected Subjects on HAART, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of T-cell immunotherapy (SB-728mR-T) following cyclophosphamide conditioning. CCR5 is a major co-receptor for HIV entry into T-cells. Disruption of CCR5 by zinc finger nuclease (SB-728mR) blocks HIV entry into the T-cells therefore protects the T-cells from HIV infection. Safety (primary outcome) and anti-viral effect (secondary outcome) of zinc finger nuclease-mediated CCR5 disrupted autologous T-cells (SB-728mR-T) will be evaluated in the study.    ,NCT02225665

HIV,Steering Together in a New Direction: Reducing the Risk of HIV/STD Among African American Men, African American men have by far the highest rates of HIV in the US but there are few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions to dissuade heterosexually active African American men from engaging sexual risk behavior. This research seeks to address this gap in the behavioral intervention literature. That self-initiated behavior change as well as intervention-induced behavior change is often short-lived eroding over time is widely known; accordingly this research also seeks to test a strategy to sustain intervention efficacy. In a RCT African American men 18 to 45 years reporting recent unprotected intercourse with a woman will be randomized to the Steering Together in a New Direction (STAND) HIV Risk Reduction Intervention or a No-Intervention Control Condition. To test a strategy to sustain intervention effects the men also will be randomized to receive or not receive individually tailored text messages. The theoretical basis of the interventions is social cognitive theory and the reasoned action approach which is an extension of the theory of planned behavior and the theory of reasoned action. Men will complete self-report measures via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing at baseline and immediately post and 6 and 12 months post-intervention. The trial will test whether the STAND HIV Risk Reduction Intervention as compared with the No-Intervention Control Condition increases consistent condom use the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include unprotected intercourse multiple sexual partners insertive anal intercourse and proportion condom-protected intercourse. The trial will also test whether STAND's efficacy is greater among men in the Text Messaging Intervention compared with men not receiving text messages. This will provide information on the utility of a low-cost strategy to extend an intervention's efficacy. Finally the study will test for mediation of intervention effects: the hypothesis that STAND affects outcome expectancies and self-efficacy which in turn affect consistent condom use.    ,NCT02572401

HIV,New Strategies to Assess Anal Cancer Risk In Women, The purpose of this research is to study different strategies to identify women at highest risk for anal cancer. Primarily investigators want to study a risk assessment called the Anal Cancer Risk Index; it gives women an overall number score based on risk factors that they may have for anal cancer such as age number of sexual partners or smoking. Investigators seek to understand whether women with higher Anal Cancer Risk Index scores are more likely to have abnormal results on anal pap smears HPV tests or anal biopsies. The study team will collect swabs of the cervix and the anus to study different laboratory tests that could identify women at highest risk of cervical and anal cancer. These laboratory tests include an anal pap smear tests for markers of disease and tests that detect the HPV types most likely to cause cancer. The study team would like to see which of these laboratory tests do the best job at predicting precancerous lesions in the anus and are better indicators of risk for cancer. After collecting these swabs women will have a procedure called high resolution anoscopy where investigators look closely at the anus and biopsy any suspicious areas. Finally the study team will look for HPV proteins and changes that HPV can make in cells to see if these tests predict anal lesions.    ,NCT02873741

HIV,Soy Modulation of Immune Activation LDL- Levels and Lowering Inflammation by Pretzel Isoflavone Dietary Intervention, Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART HIV medications) dramatically increases the expected lifespan of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)infected patients; yet the risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as heart attacks and stroke are increased in this population. This increased risk may be linked to persistent inflammation and activation of the immune system. Although the relationship between cardiovascular disease and HIV-infected individuals who are taking HIV medications is not well understood the team of researchers involved in this study observed that a diet rich in soy at levels recommended by the FDA (Federal Drug Administration) improved cholesterol levels and inflammation in individuals not infected with HIV. From this study the researchers hope to gain understanding on how dietary soy will impact HIV-infected individuals who are taking HIV medications. Two pretzels with and without soy developed at OSU (Ohio State University) in the Department of Food Science and Technology and used in previous clinical trials will be used to investigate how the pretzel snacks will affect your cardiovascular disease risk immunity and how your body breaks down naturally occurring chemicals from soy.    ,NCT02818283

HIV,Men Together Making a Difference: Reducing HIV/STD Risk Behavior Among South African Men, Sub-Saharan Africa has about 10% of the world's population but was home to more than 60% of all people living with HIV in 2003. South Africa continues to have the largest number of people living with HIV in the world and as in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa heterosexual exposure is the primary HIV transmission category. Worldwide efforts to stem the spread of HIV among heterosexuals have stressed the impact of HIV on women. Oft-cited statistics indicate that about half of all people living with HIV are women. The strategies typically offered to address the impact of HIV on women are interventions with women. To be sure there is an alternative approach to addressing women's risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV one that would be an important complement to the predominant approach: namely focusing on men. By reducing men's sexual risk behavior it should be possible to reduce rates of HIV in both men and women. Men's rates would decline because they are the recipients of the intervention; women's rates would decline because they have sex with men. Interventions aimed at men could take into account the power that men have in sexual decision-making and risk taking. However whether one considers the US literature or the international literature few randomized controlled trials of HIV/STD risk-reduction interventions have focused on heterosexual men. Accordingly the purpose of this research is to develop and test the efficacy of an intervention to curb HIV/STD risk-associated behavior in South African men who have sex with women. A cluster-randomized control trial design will be used to reduce the potential for contamination between treatment arms that would be present if individuals were randomized. An attention control group will be used to control for Hawthorne effects special attention and group interaction. Matched pairs of neighborhoods in Black townships in Eastern Cape Province South Africa similar on key characteristics will be created 22 pairs will be randomly selected and men will be recruited. One neighborhood in each pair will be randomly assigned to each of the 2 study arms. The primary hypothesis is that men who receive a culturally appropriate theory-based HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention will be more likely to report consistently using condoms during vaginal intercourse in the 12-month post intervention period than will men who receive an attention-control intervention controlling for baseline condom use.    ,NCT01490359
HIV,Real-life Effectiveness of the Kaletra Adherence Support Assistance (KASA) Program, The study will assess the effectiveness of KASA (Kaletra Patient Support Program) on improving or maintaining treatment adherence in HIV positive patients that have been initiated on treatment with Kaletra®. This will be a purely observational study conducted on patients that will be on treatment with Kaletra®. All treatments will be as per routine care including the use of KASA which will be determined exclusively by the physician and the patient without consideration of the study. The efficacy of disease management programs as assessed in randomized clinical trials is not representative of real - life effectiveness observed under routine clinical practice. In real - life settings the utilization of and compliance with disease management programs by physicians and patients is not uniform. Therefore assessment of their true effectiveness is ideally conducted under a pure observational setting without any interference from the investigators with respect to making the programs available to patients and enforcing their adherence to them.    ,NCT01662336
HIV,A Safety and Efficacy Study of Amdoxovir in HIV-1 Treatment-experienced Subjects., This is a double-blind Phase 2a study to test the safety and efficacy of an investigational HIV drug amdoxovir (300 mg or 500 mg twice daily) compared with tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy-experienced subjects who are currently failing antiretroviral therapy.

HIV,Pilot Study of Bydureon to Treat Diabetes in HIV-infected Adults, This pilot study will evaluate the effects of the anti-diabetic drug Bydureon (exenatide extended-release formulation) on blood sugar levels and serum markers of inflammation in a cohort of 12 HIV-infected adults on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with untreated diabetes mellitus. Previous studies have shown that high levels of persistent systemic inflammation predict the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in HIV-infected persons on cART (a group at very high risk of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction). Bydureon has demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects in prior studies of non-HIV infected persons which suggests that this agent may represent a unique and preferred medication for the treatment of insulin resistance in HIV-infected adults. The Investigators hypothesize that short-term (16 weeks) therapy with Bydureon will improve glucose tolerance and significantly reduce circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and highly-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) two biomarkers strongly implicated in the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in diabetic HIV-infected cART-treated adults.    ,NCT01791465

HIV,Being Responsible for Ourselves HIV Risk Reduction for Black MSM, The incidence of HIV/AIDS among African American men who have sex with men (MSM) is alarming and the public health response to this urgent situation has been hampered by a lack of sexual risk reduction interventions with solid evidence of efficacy in this population. Accordingly the broad long-term objective of the proposed research is to identify interventions to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infection (STI) among African American MSM. This application seeks funds to develop and test the efficacy of a theory-based contextually appropriate behavioral intervention to reduce sexual risk behavior among African American MSM. Intervention development will be guided by social cognitive theory the theory of planned behavior qualitative information from focus groups and findings from a longitudinal survey of men from the study population. A one-on-one intervention will be utilized to address the specific prevention needs of each man and to allay participants' concerns about revealing their sexual involvement with men by virtue of participating in a group or workshop intervention. The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial design with baseline immediate post intervention and 6 and 12 months post intervention assessments. The participants will be African American MSM who will be randomized to a one-on-one sexual risk reduction intervention or a one-on-one health promotion intervention that will serve as the control condition. The primary outcome is consistent condom use during anal and vaginal intercourse. The study will test whether the intervention increases the consistent use of condoms during anal intercourse the primary outcome whether it decreases other sexual risk behaviors and whether social cognitive theory variables mediate the effects of the intervention on consistent condom use. This study will provide an urgently needed intervention to reduce the risk of HIV and other STIs in one of the highest risk populations in the United States.    ,NCT02561286

HIV,Fosamprenavir in Pts With Hepatic Impairment, APV10017 was a pharmacokinetic study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics safety and tolerability of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/RTV) at reduced doses over 14 days in HIV-infected subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (HI). Based on these data two new regimens have recently been approved by the EMEA and FDA in these patient groups; FPV 700mg BID/RTV 100mg QD for those with mild HI (Child-Pugh score 4-6) and FPV 450mg BID/RTV 100mg QD for those with moderate HI (Child Pugh score 7-9). The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has requested longer-term safety data among this hepatically impaired HIV-infected population who have received the recently updated FPV/RTV dosing regimens. An observational cohort study will be conducted using routinely collected data in three European HIV patient cohorts with a high proportion of hepatitis co-infected individuals. Patients who received FPV/RTV will be followed to address the following objectives. Primary: To assess the safety and tolerability of FPV/RTV-based ART in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Secondary: A). To compare the safety and tolerability of FPV/RTV-based ART in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment when compared to FPV/RTV-based ART in hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) co-infected subjects with normal hepatic function. B). To compare the safety and tolerability of FPV/RTV-based ART to lopinavir/ritonavir LPV/RTV-based ART in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.    ,NCT01054586
HIV,PENTA Fosamprenavir Study, Twice daily fosamprenavir in combination with low dose ritonavir (FPV/RTV BID) is indicated for the treatment of HIV-infected adults adolescents and children of 6 years of age and above for use in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. Safety data from two GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) clinical trials (APV29005 - involving twice-daily doses of FPV with or without RTV and APV20003 - with once daily dosing of FPV/RTV among 2-18 year olds) indicated that gastrointestinal events were the most commonly reported AEs but that the majority of events were mild and of short duration. Treatment emergent grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was reported in 20% of children in the APV20003 trial; and neutropenia was identified as a potential safety concern by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). The objectives of this study were to conduct an observational cohort study of the usage and safety of FPV/RTV in children and adolescents (aged 6 ??18 years) with HIV infection in several European HIV paediatric cohorts. Data will be collected for 3 years (2008 2009 and 2010).    ,NCT01077635

HIV,Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR)-Risk of Birth Defects, The APR began as the 'Zidovudine in pregnancy Registry' in January 1989 and became the 'Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry' in January 1993. The purpose of the APR is to detect any major teratogenic effects involving any of the Registry drugs when administered to pregnant HIV positive women. The Registry is intended to provide an early signal of teratogenicity associated with prenatal use of the antiretroviral drugs. The Registry collects data on prenatal exposures to antiretroviral drugs potential confounding factors (such as maternal age disease status during pregnancy) and information about the outcome of the pregnancy. The Registry is managed by INC Research. The scientific conduct and analysis of the Registry data are overseen by an independent Advisory Committee consisting of members from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the academic sector. Registry data are obtained from participating providers who encompass physicians in private practice as well as hospitals and community clinics. The registry is co-sponsored and co-funded by 26 pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs used in ART. For an updated version of the registry please see NCT00404989.    ,NCT01137981

HIV,Dolutegravir Renal Impairment Study, Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on behalf of Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare LLC. DTG is metabolized primarily by uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UGT)1A1 with a minor role of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A and with renal elimination of unchanged drug being extremely low (< 1% of the dose). Fifty-three percent of the total oral dose is excreted unchanged in the feces but it is unknown if all or part of this is due to unabsorbed drug or some percentage of biliary excretion of the glucuronide conjugate which can be further degraded to form the parent compound in the gut lumen. The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for renal impairment studies states that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in patients with renal impairment should be conducted even for those drugs primarily metabolized or secreted in bile because renal impairment can inhibit some pathways of hepatic and gut drug metabolism and transport. This study is planned as an open label single-dose pharmacokinetic study to evaluate plasma DTG pharmacokinetics following oral administration to subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and matched healthy controls. Results from this study are expected to enable the development of appropriate dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment.    ,NCT01353716
HIV,Drug Interaction Study Between Dolutegravir and Prednisone, Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. DTG is primarily metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) with cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 pathway as a minor route. Corticosteroids have demonstrated induction effects on UGTs and CYP3A4. Corticosteroids are often used in HIV-infected subjects and have the potential to reduce DTG exposure due to enzyme induction when co-administered. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether concomitant prednisone administration can affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DTG. The study is a two part two period open label study. Part 1 will evaluate the effect of a high prednisone dose on DTG PK with the potential for an additional Part 2 depending on the results from Part 1. In Part 1 approximately 12 healthy subjects will receive DTG 50mg q24h for 5 days in Period 1. Subjects will then be administered DTG 50mg q24h in combination with prednisone 60mg for 5 days followed by a 5 day taper (total duration of 10 days) in Period 2. PK data of DTG will be obtained from Part 1 and used to inform decision making on the need for Part 2. If DTG exposure is reduced by more than 50% in Part 1 Part 2 will be carried out where a second cohort of subjects will receive DTG 50mg q24h DTG for 5 days in Period 1 followed by DTG 50mg q24h in combination with prednisone 20mg for 5 days followed by a 5 day taper (total duration of 10 days) in Period 2. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples for DTG will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. All doses of study drugs will be taken following a moderate fat meal. This study will be conducted at one center in the United States with healthy adult male and female subjects.    ,NCT01425099

HIV,Drug Exposure Registry for GSK2248761 an Investigational NNRTI, The World Health Organization has estimated that as many as 10% of the population worldwide may at some point experience at least one seizure. The percentage with active epilepsy is from 0.4% to 1%. From 40% to 65% of patients with HIV infection have been estimated to have some neurological involvement; the percentage reaches as high as 70% to 80% when post-mortem assessments are included. Estimates of the percentage of HIV-infected patients with seizure occurrence have varied widely with one review finding a range from 2% to 20%. The highest percentage in this range was reported at a center that exclusively treated patients with neurological involvement in India where HIV clade C subtype is predominant. Query of another neurology department's database determined that of the HIV-infected patients treated at the center all of whom were referred for neurological symptoms 6.1% experienced seizures. Underlying neurologic diseases in these patients included HIV-associated encephalopathy progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and toxoplasmosis. In a Spanish population 3% of HIV-infected patients over a one-year study period were found to have new-onset seizures which were attributed to drug toxicity in 47% intracranial lesions in 35% and metabolic derangements in 12%. Drug-discontinuation studies magnetic resonance imaging studies and animal studies have produced recent evidence that some antiretroviral therapies may have neurotoxic effects warranting further research. Individuals who are treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy are at risk for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in which immune recovery triggers clinical deterioration as the newly invigorated immune system reacts to pathogens that either represent ongoing opportunistic infection or were previously successfully controlled. In a population initiating combination antiretroviral therapy between 1999 and 2007 0.9% developed neurological manifestations of IRIS. Seizures may occur as part of a neurological IRIS syndrome such as encephalitis and toxoplasmosis. Two randomized Phase 2b dose-finding studies were conducted in HIV-1 infected adults to compare GSK2248761 100 mg and 200 mg given once daily as part of an antiretroviral treatment regimen. One of the studies (SGN113399) was in subjects with prior exposure to antiretroviral therapy where GSK2248761 100 mg and 200 mg once daily were compared to determine the best dose in this population. A contemporary control arm receiving etravirine 200 mg twice daily was also included and all arms included a twice-daily background therapy consisting of darunavir/ritonavir 600 mg/100 mg plus raltegravir 400 mg. The other study (SGN113404) was in treatment-naïve subjects comparing GSK2248761 100 mg and 200 mg once daily to determine the best dose in this population. A contemporary control arm receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily was also included and all arms were given background therapy selected by investigators from either once-daily abacavir/lamivudine 600 mg/300 mg or tenofovir/emtricitabine 300 mg/200 mg. Of a planned total population in both studies of 300 subjects 35 were enrolled before the studies were terminated because of the occurrence of seizures in five subjects. All of the subjects who experienced seizures were enrolled into SGN113399 four randomized to receive 200 mg GSK2248761 and one randomized to receive 100 mg GSK2248761. There were no seizures in the subjects receiving GSK2248761 in study SGN113404. At the time of study termination subjects had been enrolled and received GSK2248761 at 19 sites in four countries: France Romania United States and Germany. Although potential contributory conditions have been identified in some cases definitive causative factors for the seizure occurrence have not been established. The purpose of this study is to follow subjects who previously received GSK2248761 while enrolled in the Phase 2b studies which were halted due to unexpected seizures. The study will collect data on all subjects and will be used to monitor for additional seizures as well as collect additional clinical data on all subjects.    ,NCT01458132
HIV,Drug Interaction Study Between Dolutegravir and an Oral Contraceptive Containing Norgestimate and Ethinylestradiol, Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of HIV infection. DTG will likely be used in women on oral contraceptives (OC) for birth control. Based on accumulated non-clinical and clinical drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic data there is a low likelihood of drug interaction between DTG and most widely used OC drugs. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of DTG administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a commonly used oral contraceptive product Ortho-Cyclen (combination of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol) in healthy female subjects. Each subject will participate in a Run-in period (if needed) followed by two treatment periods. Approximately 16 subjects will be randomized in a cross-over fashion to either Ortho-Cyclen with DTG or Ortho-Cyclen with Placebo for 10 days and switch to the alternate treatment for another 10 days. Subjects will return to the study center for final follow up evaluations 7 - 14 days after the final dose of study medication.    ,NCT01498861

HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Boceprevir and Telaprevir on Dolutegravir Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Adult Subjects (ING115697).," Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Co-infection with Hepatitis C (HCV) is common in HIV-infected subjects therefore it is expected that DTG will be coadministered with treatments for HCV. Boceprevir (BCV) and Telaprevir (TVR) are protease inhibitors for the treatment of HCV that were recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency (FDA/EMA) and have rapidly been adopted to ""standard of care"" in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavarin. This is a single-center open-label two-cohort two-period one-way study in healthy adult subjects. A total of approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled in order to obtain 24 evaluable subjects (12 per cohort). In the first treatment period all subjects will receive DTG 50 mg once daily for 5 days (treatment A). In period 2 subjects will receive DTG 50 mg once daily plus either BCV 800 mg q8h (treatment B) for 10 days or TVR 750 mg q8h (treatment C) for 10 days. There will be no washout between treatments. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. Subjects will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug two treatment periods and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. This study will be conducted at one center in the US with healthy adult male and female subjects.    ",NCT01563328

HIV,Evaluation of the Bioequivalence of a Combined Formulated Tablet, Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572) is a next-generation integrase inhibitor (INI) currently in phase 3 clinical trials for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) have greatly simplified the treatment of patients with HIV. While Atripla (an FDC of tenofovir (TDF) emtricitabine (FTC) and efavirenz (EFV)) has become the preferred first line regimen due in large part to its convenient presentation as a full treatment regimen in a single product other options are needed. A fixed-dose combination of DTG/abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) is one such opportunity. Part A of this study will be a single-dose two-treatment crossover pivotal bioequivalence (BE) evaluation of the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet in 66 healthy subjects. The reference formulations in this trial will be the 50 mg DTG tablet that is currently being used in the Phase 3 clinical trials and the already marketed FDC tablet product EPZICOM??(ABC 600 mg/3TC 300 mg).It is intended that the results of this pivotal bioequivalence study will show that the proposed commercial DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet formulation is bioequivalent to DTG plus EPZICOM administered as separate tablets. Part B of this study will evaluate the effect of a high fat meal on the FDC tablet in 12 healthy subjects that have already participated in Part A of the study. There will be a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug and a follow up visit within 7-14 days after the last dose. There will be a 7 day washout between doses in each treatment period. The following PK parameters for DTG ABC and 3TC will be measured: area under the concentration curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time (AUC(0-infinity)) Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC (0-t)) maximum observed concentration (Cmax) lag time before observation of drug concentrations (tlag) time of occurrence of Cmax (tmax) terminal phase half-life (t½) terminal elimination phase rate constant (λz) percentage of AUC obtained by extrapolation (%AUCex)apparent clearance following oral dosing (CL/F) and apparent terminal phase volume    ,NCT01622790
HIV,Dose Ranging Study of GSK1265744 Plus Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors for Induction of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Virologic Suppression Followed by Virologic Suppression Maintenance by GSK1265744 Plus Rilpivirine, The study is designed to select a dose of GSK1265744 primarily on the basis of antiviral activity and tolerability in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral naive subjects. This study consists of two parts: Induction Phase: Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized (50 subjects in each of the 4 treatment arms). The Induction Phase consists of a 24 week dose-ranging evaluation of GSK1265744 at blinded doses of 10 mg 30 mg and 60 mg once-daily and a control arm of open-label efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg once daily. The background dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all arms will be either abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) as selected by the Investigator. Subjects randomized to a GSK1265744 containing arm who successfully complete 24 weeks on study and demonstrate virologic suppression (defined as having a plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid [RNA] <50 copies per milliliter [c/mL] before Week 24 with no signs of virologic rebound) will become eligible for the Maintenance Phase of this study. Maintenance Phase: The background NRTIs will be discontinued and the subjects will continue their randomized dose of GSK1265744 in combination with rilpivirine (RPV) 25 mg once-daily for an additional 72 weeks. The Maintenance phase will evaluate the ability of this two drug ART regimen to maintain virologic suppression through Week 48 Week 72 and Week 96.

HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Calcium Carbonate and Ferrous Fumarate on Pharmacokinetics of Dolutegravir in Healthy Adult Subjects, Human immune virus (HIV) infected subjects may take mineral supplements in combination with their antiretroviral medications. Calcium and Iron supplementations are commonly used and both of these have the potential to interact with Dolutegravir (DTG) this study will evaluate the potential of calcium and iron supplements to decrease DTG exposure. It will also evaluate two possible strategies for combined use; if an interaction is observed. The first strategy is a two hour separation. The second strategy involves the administration of DTG and the supplement with a meal since the presence of food modestly increases DTG exposure and because mineral supplements can be administered with food. This is an open label randomized two cohort four-period cross-over study in healthy volunteers. One cohort will examine the effects of calcium carbonate and the other cohort will examine the effects of ferrous fumarate on the pharmacokinetic (PK) of DTG. Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled into each of the two cohorts and receive each of four treatments in a randomized fashion: 1) A single dose of DTG 50 milligram (mg) administered under fasted conditions ; 2) A single dose of DTG 50 mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate under fasted conditions ; 3) A single dose of DTG 50 mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate with a moderate-fat meal; 4) A single dose of DTG 50 mg administered under fasted conditions 2 hours prior to administration of a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between treatments. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. This study will be conducted at one center in the United States with healthy adult male and female subjects.    ,NCT01762995

HIV,Open-label Study of Dolutegravir (DTG) or Efavirenz (EFV) for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) - Tuberculosis (TB) Co-infection, HIV/Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection have profound effects on the host's immune system. TB is the most common cause of death in patients with HIV worldwide. Rifamycins (such as rifampicin [RIF]) are an important component of TB therapy because of their unique activity. The problem is that most protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) used to treat HIV have significant drug-drug interactions with RIF that can lead to reduced concentrations of these agents with risk of treatment failure or resistance. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz (EFV) does not present the same significant drug interactions with RIF. EFV-based HIV treatment was tested in patients concomitantly treated with RIF-containing TB therapy demonstrating that their co-administration can be used safely and effectively. However the side effect profile of EFV overlaps with the RIF-containing TB regimens and makes the management of treatment toxicities very complex. Integrase inhibitors (INI) such as dolutegravir (DTG) may offer an important alternative to EFV-based therapy in TB coinfected patients. A Phase I drug-drug interaction study was conducted in healthy HIV-seronegative subjects and showed that DTG at 50 mg twice daily given together with RIF was well-tolerated and resulted in DTG concentrations similar to those of DTG 50 mg given once daily alone which is the recommended dose for INI-naive patients. Therefore ART regimens using DTG 50 mg twice daily may represent a new treatment option for TB-infected patients who require concurrent treatment for HIV infection. This is a Phase III b randomized open-label study describing the efficacy and safety of DTG and EFV-containing ART regimens in HIV/TB co-infected patients. This study is designed to assess the antiviral activity of DTG or efavirenz (EFV) ART-containing regimens through 48 weeks. A total of approximately 115 +/-5% subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to DTG (approximately 69 subjects) and EFV (approximately 46 subjects) respectively. This study will include a Screening Period a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to 48 weeks plus a 4-week extension) and a DTG Open-label extension (OLE). During the DTG OLE subjects will be supplied with DTG until it is locally approved and commercially available the subject no longer derives clinical benefit or the subject meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation which ever comes first.    ,NCT02178592
HIV,Bioavailability Study of a Dolutegravir Dispersible Tablet and Effect of Different Types of Water on the Dispersible Tablet in Healthy Volunteers, Dolutegravir (DTG) is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor approved in the United States Canada Australia and EU.

HIV,Comparative Efficacy and Safety Study of Dolutegravir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir in Second-line Treatment, For treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) publicly funded programmes tend to follow World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to use a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART); however there is a need for further data on the best treatment options for people with HIV-1 who have virological failure with this first-line regimen. The number of patients failing on their first-line regimen is increasing thereby requiring a switch to second-line treatment to reduce accumulation of drug-resistance mutations disease progression HIV transmission and death. WHO guidelines recommend second-line antiretroviral therapy for adults consisting of two NRTIs + a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI); atazanavir (ATV) plus ritonavir (RTV) or lopinavir (LPV)/RTV are the preferred boosted PI options. This study is conducted to demonstrate non-inferior antiviral activity at 48 weeks of a dolutegravir (DTG) containing regimen compared to a WHO-recommended standard of care regimen for second line treatment LPV/RTV + two NRTIs in HIV-1 infected patients failing first line therapy. This study comprises of a Screening Phase (approximately 28 to 42 days) a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to Week 48 plus a 4-week treatment extension) and a Continuation Phase. Approximately 612 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 milligram (mg) once daily or LPV/RTV (800/200 mg once daily or 400/100 mg twice daily in accordance with investigator decision and local label) each added to an investigator selected background regimen of two NRTIs at least one of which needs to be fully active based on viral resistance testing at Screening. Subjects randomized to receive DTG who successfully complete 52 weeks of treatment will continue to have access to DTG until it is either locally approved and commercial supplies are available to patients or the patient no longer derives clinical benefit or the patient meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation.    ,NCT02227238

HIV,Pharmacokinetics Study of GSK1265744 in Subjects With Severe Renal Impairment, GSK1265744 (744) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) currently in development for both the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Renal elimination of unchanged 744 is extremely low with no parent 744 detected in the urine after a single 30 mg radiolabeled dose. Despite the minimal contribution of renal clearance on overall 744 elimination renal impairment may potentially inhibit some pathways of hepatic and gut drug metabolism and transport and as a result may impact 744 pharmacokinetics. The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for renal impairment studies suggests that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in patients with renal impairment be conducted even for those drugs primarily metabolized or secreted in bile. The study will be comprised of two cohorts (severe renal impairment and normal renal function) of 8 subjects each. Upon enrolment each subject will be admitted to the study center and undergo serial PK sampling following a single dose of oral 744 30 milligrams (mg). Subjects will return to the clinic for follow-up evaluations 10-14 days after the 744 30 mg dose.    ,NCT02354937

If the geometric mean total plasma area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time (AUC[0-infinity]) of GSK1265744 is increased by >2-fold in moderately impaired subjects relative to matched controls Part 2 will be conducted to evaluate GSK1265744 PK in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (n=8) and matched control subjects (n=8). All subjects will receive a single 30 milligram (mg) oral dose of GSK1265744. The primary objective of the study is to compare plasma PK parameters of GSK1265744 in subjects with hepatic impairment to healthy controls matched in gender age and body mass index (BMI).    ,NCT02354950
HIV,Relative Oral Bioavailability Study of Different Fixed Dose Combinations of Dolutegravir and Rilpivirine in Healthy Subjects, Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection requires daily oral administration of a combination of antiretroviral drugs to reduce the patient's HIV levels. Dolutegravir (DTG) a HIV-1 integrase inhibitor (INI) and Rilpivirine (RPV) a non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) are approved for the treatment of HIV infection. This study is aimed to evaluate the relative bioavailability and food effect of single doses of several experimental fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets of Dolutegravir 50 milligrams (mg) and Rilpivirine 25 mg (DTG/RPV 50 mg/25 mg) relative to co-administration of a single dose of the reference single entity products (DTG 50 mg and RPV 25 mg) in healthy adult subjects. This is a 2-part study. Part 1 will be conducted as a randomized open label 3-way crossover design in 24 subjects. Part 1 will evaluate the relative bioavailability of up to 4 test formulations relative to the reference single entity products administered in fed state. Part 2 will be conducted as a randomized open-label 3-way crossover design in 3 distinct cohorts each with 12 subjects. Part 2 will evaluate the relative bioavailability of up to 3 most promising FDC formulation selected from Part 1 (DTG/RPV FDC-1 DTG/RPV FDC-2 DTG/RPV FDC-3) administered in fasted and fed state. Subjects will also receive the reference treatment from Part 1 co-administered under fasted conditions. This study will consist of a screening visit three treatment periods each with a single dose of study drug separated by a washout of at least 9 days and a follow-up visit.

HIV,Pharmacokinetic Study of Cabotegravir Long-acting in Healthy Adult Volunteers, Cabotegravir (CAB) long-acting (LA) is a promising candidate for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) due to its potent antiretroviral activity and infrequent dosing requirements. Currently the CAB concentrations achieved in the anatomical sites associated with sexual HIV transmission following the proposed 600 milligram (mg) intramuscular (IM) PrEP dose are unknown. These data will enhance our understanding of CAB distribution to the anatomical mucosal tissue believed to be relevant to sexual HIV-1 transmission and supplement the data to support future PrEP clinical trial development. The primary objective is to determine the PK concentrations of CAB following LA administration in plasma and in vaginal tissue (VT) cervical tissue (CT) and cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) in healthy women and in rectal tissue (RT) and rectal fluid (RF) in healthy men and women following a single 600 mg IM dose. This will be a Phase 1 open label study in healthy subjects to assess the pharmacokinetics of CAB LA in the plasma and mucosal locations associated with sexual HIV-1 transmission: vaginal tissue cervical tissue cervicovaginal fluid rectal tissue and rectal fluid. The study will consist of a screening period a 28-day oral lead-in phase at a dose of 30 mg per day followed by a 14-21 day washout period and a single dose of CAB LA 600 mg as an IM (intragluteal) injection with compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling for up to 12 weeks. Subjects will return for safety assessments and plasma PK sampling at Week 24 and Week 36 post-injection and undergo a follow-up/withdrawal visit at Week 52 post-injection    ,NCT02478463
HIV,Bone Mineral Density in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1)-Infected Adult Subjects Switching From a Tenofovir Regimen to a Dolutegravir Plus Rilpivirine Regimen, The purpose of this study is to evaluate any change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) in subjects following the switch from a triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen containing Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) - sparing two - drug regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) + rilpivirine (RPV) in subjects participating in the parent studies 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2). This open-label parallel group study is a sub-study which will recruit subjects who are receiving ART regimens which include TDF at the time of randomization to receive treatment in one of two identical parent studies 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2). These are Phase III randomised open-label multicentre parallel-group non-inferiority studies evaluating the efficacy safety and tolerability of switching to DTG plus RPV from current integrase inhibitor (INI)- non NNRTI- or protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral regimen in HIV-1-infected adults who are virologically suppressed having HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels <50 copies per millilitre (c/mL). Randomisation in the parent studies will be stratified by baseline third agent class (INI NNRTI or PI) age group (< or =>50 years old) and participation in this Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) sub-study therefore there will also be balance across the treatment arms in this sub-study both overall and with respect to baseline third agent class and age at entry. The study population will include approximately 75 evaluable subjects recruited from the Early Switch DTG + RPV treatment group of the parent studies 201636 and 201637 and approximately 75 evaluable subjects from the Late Switch group who continue their current antiretroviral therapy (CAR) through to Week 52 across both the 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2) studies. Subjects participating in study 202094 will have DEXA scans performed at Day 1 and at study Weeks 48 100 and 148 in parallel with the corresponding scheduled visits in the parent studies.    ,NCT02478632
HIV,Pharmacokinetics Safety and Tolerability Study of Abacavir/ Dolutegravir/ Lamivudine Fixed-dose Combination Tablets in Healthy Japanese Subjects, The abacavir (ABC)/dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC) 600 milligrams (mg)/50 mg/300 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet is currently approved in the United States (US) and Europe. Although the pharmacokinetics (PK) safety and tolerability of ABC/DTG/3TC FDC tablets have been extensively studied in subjects not of Japanese heritage these parameters have not been exclusively assessed in Japanese subjects. To support the marketing application in Japan this single-dose open-label study will characterize the PK safety and tolerability of ABC/DTG/3TC FDC tablet in adult Japanese healthy subjects. A maximum of 12 subjects will be enrolled such that approximately 10 evaluable subjects complete the study.

HIV,Relative Bio-availability Study of Dolutegravir and Lamivudine Fixed Dose Combinations, Dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine (3TC) are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets of existing approved drugs are preferred by many patients and offer the potential for increased patient adherence and consequently a reduced likelihood of virological failure and viral resistance. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of two experimental FDC tablets of DTG and 3TC relative to co-administration of the single entity products in healthy adult subjects. This study will be conducted as a randomized open label three-way crossover design with 6 treatment sequences in approximately 30 subjects. Each subject will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug three treatment periods each with a single dose of study drug and a follow-up visit within 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. There will be at least 7 days washout between dosing periods. The total duration of participation of a subject in this study will be approximately 9 weeks.    ,NCT02738931
HIV,Bioequivalence Study of a Fixed-dose Combination (FDC) of Dolutegravir (DTG) and Rilpivirine (RPV), The purpose of the study is to evaluate the bioequivalence between Fixed-dose Combination (FDC) tablet formulation of Dolutegravir (DTG) 50 milligrams (mg) and Rilpivirine (RPV) 25 mg versus co-administration of the separate tablet formulations of DTG 50 mg plus RPV 25 mg in the fed state. This pivotal bioequivalence study is to serve as a pharmacokinetic (PK) bridge to the ongoing Phase 3 trials with the separate agents. This study will be conducted under fed conditions to appropriately mimic the conditions in the Phase 3 trials. This is a single-center randomized open-label 2-period single-dose crossover study. A minimum of 86 healthy adult subjects will be randomized such that a minimum of approximately 82 evaluable subjects complete the study. The total duration of participation of a subject in this study will be approximately 8 weeks which includes a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug two treatment periods each with a single dose of study drug and a follow-up visit within 12-17 days after the last dose of study drug. There will be a washout of at least 21 days between each dose of study drug. A blinded (for treatment) review of DTG and RPV plasma concentration data for approximately the first 40 subjects will be conducted. If the within-subject coefficients of variation (CVw%) for either DTG or RPV maximal drug concentration (Cmax) values are >=31%; a sample size re-estimation will be employed and additional subjects (beyond the 86 planned) will be randomized for treatment in the study. Following the re-estimation it is possible that up to approximately 154 healthy adult subjects (68 new subjects in addition to the planned 86 subjects above) will be randomized such that a maximum of approximately 146 evaluable subjects could complete the study.    ,NCT02741557

HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effect of High Fat Meal on Cabotegravir, Cabotegravir is being developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 infection. Specifically it is being developed as a component of a 2-drug maintenance regimen (post-induction of viral suppression) that includes rilpivirine. Rilpivirine requires food for optimal absorption; therefore the recommended intake of cabotegravir in the planned Phase 3 treatment studies is with food regardless of fat or calorie content when administered along with rilpivirine. This is a single-center randomized open-label two-way crossover study in healthy adult subjects to assess the effect of a high fat meal on the single dose pharmacokinetics of CAB 30 mg. Approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled in the study and will be screened for 30 days. Twelve subjects with at least 10 hours of fasting will be randomized to receive a single dose of cabotegravir orally (Schedule 'A'). The remaining 12 subjects will receive a single dose of cabotegravir orally along with high fat meal (Schedule 'B'). After 15 days the subjects earlier undergoing 'Schedule A' will be switched to 'Schedule B' and those undergoing 'Schedule B' will undergo 'Schedule A'. All the subjects will be followed up to 30 days from the day of receiving first dose of cabotegravir to evaluate the effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir.    ,NCT02799264

HIV,PH3b DTG Study in HIV-1 Subjects Completing IMPAACT Study P1093, Dolutegravir (DTG) is a potent inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase that has been developed for the treatment of HIV. This is a phase 3b (PH3b) non-randomized open-label multi-center treatment rollover study. The primary objective of this pediatric interventional study is to provide continued access to DTG for eligible participants who previously participated in the international maternal pediatric adolescent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] clinical trials (IMPAACT) P1093 study (parent study) and who cannot locally access DTG in the public sector. The P1093 study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) safety tolerability and antiviral activity of DTG in HIV-1 experienced adolescents and children as well as treatment-naive infants and toddlers. Participants who have no evidence of virological failure (VF) and who have tolerated DTG in the parent study without any significant toxicity leading to the permanent discontinuation of this drug and withdrawal from the parent study will be considered for this open-label continued access study. Participants will be receiving their age/weight appropriate dose of DTG as defined in the parent study. The objective of this study will be supported through evaluation of serious adverse events. The duration of participant accrual into the study will extend until DTG receives local (by country) regulatory approval . Therefore participants enrolled into this study will be those who will benefit from treatment and will continue to receive DTG until local (by country) regulatory approval and commercial or other availability occurs from another source (e.g. government programs aid programs assistance programs etc.). Participants will be enrolled after all screening procedures have been completed. In most cases the Screening visit will overlap with the participant's penultimate visit on the parent study (at Week 180 of P1093). Participants who meet all entry criteria may enroll and will be seen in the clinic every 12 weeks for a safety evaluation and to receive DTG. It is estimated that no more than 120 participants will be enrolled in this study.    ,NCT03016533

This is a study in healthy adult subjects to evaluate the bioequivalence of a Combined Formulated Tablet compared with maraviroc and Combivir administered concurrently versus maraviroc + Combivir. 42 subjects will be enrolled in the study such that 40 subjects complete dosing and critical assessments. The total duration of a subject's participation will be approximately 33 to 35 days including a screening period (Day ??1 to Day ??) 2 treatment periods (Days 1-3) at least a 7-day washout between Period 1 and Period 2 and a follow-up visit 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug in Period 2. Each dosing period will begin the evening prior to dosing and extend until 48 hours (Day 3) after dosing. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following 2 treatments in Period 1 then crossover to receive the alternate treatment in Period 2: In Sequence 1 (N=21) subjects will receive Treatment A followed by a 7 day washout and Treatment B. In Sequence 2 (N=21) subjects will receive Treatment B followed by a 7 day washout and Treatment A. Treatment A consists of 1 tablet of maraviroc 300 mg lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg as a combined formulation after an overnight fast. Treatment B consists of 1 tablet of maraviroc 300 mg + 1 tablet of Combivir taken concurrently after an overnight fast. On Day 1 of each treatment period subjects will receive study drug in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Study drug will be administered with 240 mL of water. Dosing in each treatment period will be separated by a minimum washout period of at least 7 days between doses. All subjects will undergo safety and other assessments.

HIV,Methadone-Dolutegravir (DTG - GSK1349572) Drug Interaction Study., Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of HIV infection. As HIV-infected subjects may also be receiving methadone for opioid dependence an evaluation of the potential interaction between DTG and methadone is warranted. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether concomitant administration of DTG can affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of methadone. As a secondary endpoint the PK of DTG will be compared to historical data. This study will be open-label with subjects receiving DTG and stable doses of methadone. The study will be conducted at one center in Canada in adult male and female subjects.    ,NCT01467518

HIV,Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of an Oral Contraceptive Containing Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol When Co-administered With GSK1265744 in Healthy Adult Female Subjects, This open-label fixed-sequence crossover study aims to evaluate the effect of GSK1265744 (744) oral administration on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a commonly used oral contraceptive (OC) product (combination of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel) in 20 healthy female subjects. Each subject will participate in a Run-in Period (if needed) followed by a single-sequence Treatment Period. Subjects will receive oral contraceptive containing Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol on Days 1 to 21 and be OC free on Days 22 to 28 during which withdrawal menses should occur. Subjects will receive OC alone on Days 1 to 10. Levonorgestrel (LNG) and ethinyl estradiol (EE) PK will be determined on Day 10. Subjects will then co-administer 744 and OC on Days 11 to 21. Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol PK will be determined again on Day 21 to assess if co-administration with 744 results in a significant change in OC exposure compared to OC alone. Subjects will return to the study center for final follow-up evaluations 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study medication (Days 28 to 35).    ,NCT02159131
HIV,GSK1349572 Drug Interaction Study With Efavirenz, GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of HIV infection. As GSK1349572 development progresses it may be dosed with non-nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) including efavirenz (EFV Sustiva). Efavirenz is a known inducer of CYP3A4. GSK1349572 is primarily metabolized via UGT1A1 however it also has a CYP component to its metabolism thus a drug interaction between GSK1349572 and EFV is likely. A previous study showed that another NNRTI etravirine which is also a known inducer of CYP3A and UGT reduced GSK1349572 exposure significantly. GSK1349572 is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A and is not expected to have impact on pharmacokinetics (PK) of EFV. This study will investigate the dose proportionality between single doses of 50mg and 100mg of GSK1349572 and will compare steady-state plasma PK safety and tolerability of GSK1349572 50 mg every 24h (q24h) with and without efavirenz 600 mg q24h. Approximately 12 subjects will receive a single dose of GSK1349572 100 mg (Treatment A) in Period 1 followed by a washout of greater than or equal to 6 days. In Period 2 subjects will receive GSK1349572 50mg q24h for 5 days (Treatment B). Subjects will then be administered GSK1349572 50mg q24h in the morning in combination with EFV 600 mg q24h (Treatment C) in the evening for 14 days in Period 3. There will be no washout between Periods 2 and 3. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples for GSK1349572 will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. This study will be conducted at one center in the US with healthy adult male and female subjects.    ,NCT01098526
HIV,GSK1349572 Drug Interaction Study With Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir, GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on behalf of Shionogi-ViiV HealthcareLLC. In HIV-infected patients where combination antiretroviral therapy is the standard of care it is likely that it will be dosed with boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) including fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/RTV or FPV/r). As FPV and RTV are modulators (induction as well as inhibition) of Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and Cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A which are the primary and secondary metabolic pathways of GKS1349572 it is likely that FPV/RTV will affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK1349572 therefore a drug interaction study is warranted and will be evaluated in Part A of this study. Part B will evaluate the effect of particle size of tablet variants on the PK of GSK1349572. In Part A approximately 12 subjects will receive GSK1349572 50mg every 24 hours (q24h) for 5 days (Treatment A). Subjects will then be administered GSK1349572 50mg q24h in combination with FPV/RTV 700/100 mg every 12 hours (q12h) (Treatment B) for 10 days. There will be no washout between treatments. In Part B 15 subjects will receive a single 50 mg dose (2 x 25mg tablet) in 3 different tablet variants of the same formulation differing only in particle sizes of GSK1349572 under fasted conditions in a three-way crossover design. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug.    ,NCT01209065

HIV,Relative Bioavailability Study of a Pediatric Granule Formulation of Dolutegravir, Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor currently in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A granule formulation has been developed as an alternative to the current tablet formulation for administration in pediatric populations. This is a single-center randomized open-label 5-way crossover study in healthy adult subjects. The study will evaluate the relative bioavailability of a 50 mg granule formulation of dolutegravir when administered 1) directly to mouth; 2) with purified water; 3) with Contrex brand water; and 4) with milk-based infant formula compared to the current 50 mg tablet formulation administered with tap water. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A taste assessment of the granule will also be performed. A follow-up visit will occur 5-7 days after the last dose of study drug. Pharmacokinetic assessments during the study will include area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time (AUC(0-infinity)) area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to last time of quantifiable concentration within a subject across all treatments (AUC(0-t)) maximum observed concentration (Cmax) terminal phase half-life (t½) lag time before observation of drug concentrations in sampled matrix (tlag) time of occurrence of Cmax (tmax) concentration at 24 hours post-dose (C24) and apparent clearance following oral dosing (CL/F).    ,NCT01382238

HIV,A Feasibility Study of Co-administering Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) and R-EPOCH Chemotherapy for the Management of ARL, No standard regimen currently exists for the treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma. Based on the encouraging NCI results with DA-EPOCH the US AIDS Malignancy Consortium is currently administering a phase II randomized protocol comparing EPOCH with sequential versus concurrent rituximab (AMC protocol 034). In this AMC trial the decision to co-administer cART is left to the discretion of the treating physician and the patient. While the AMC phase II study may establish an acceptable chemotherapy regimen suitable for further study in a phase III randomized trial the results will not address adherence pharmacokinetic interactions or the role of cART in AIDS-related lymphoma. The contribution of cART to the anti-lymphoma efficacy of any regimen needs to be formally studied. Our proposed trial to demonstrate the feasibility of co-administering cART with chemotherapy would justify the use of combined therapy in future AMC/International phase III protocols.    ,NCT00799136
HIV,EPOCH and Rituximab to Treat Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in Patients With HIV Infection, Background:   -  HIV-infected patients have a weakened immune system and chemotherapy which is used to treat lymphoma probably causes further damage to the immune system.   -  Limiting the amount of immune damage due to chemotherapy might decrease the number of infections and the risk of developing cancer in the future in HIV-infected patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Objectives:   -  To determine whether reducing the total amount of chemotherapy using a specific combination of drugs called EPOCH-R (etoposide doxorubicin vincristine cyclophosphamide and rituximab) will rid the body of lymphoma quickly while decreasing the risk of infections and future cancers.   -  To determine whether the lymphoma will remain undetectable for at least one year if treatment is stopped one cycle after the patient enters remission. Eligibility: -Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and HIV infection 4 years of age and older who have not been treated previously with rituximab or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Design:   -  Patients receive EPOCH-R in 3-week treatment cycles for at least three and no more than six cycles.   -  The lymphoma is evaluated using CT and PET scans at the end of treatment cycles 2 and 3. A bone marrow biopsy is repeated after cycle 2 if a biopsy was initially positive on screening for participation in the study.   -  Anti-HIV therapy is stopped before chemotherapy begins and is restarted when EPOCH-R treatment ends.   -  Patients are monitored for treatment response with blood tests and imaging scans at baseline when treatment ends 2 months after treatment ends and then every 3 to 6 months for a total of 24 months following chemotherapy.    ,NCT00006436
HIV,Chemotherapy and HAART to Treat AIDS-related Primary Brain Lymphoma," This study will investigate the use of chemotherapy plus highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients with AIDS-related primary brain lymphoma. None of the drugs used in this study are experimental but chemotherapy plus HAART has not been established as a standard treatment in patients with AIDS. The chemotherapy regimen used in this study (see below) was chosen because it may be less toxic to immune cells called T-lymphocytes than most drug treatments for lymphoma. People with AIDS 18 and older and have primary brain lymphoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination MRI CT and PET scans cerebrospinal fluid studies brain biopsy at tumor sites if possible electrocardiogram and blood tests. Participants undergo six 2-week ""induction treatment"" cycles of HAART plus chemotherapy with methotrexate rituximab and leucovorin followed by two 4-week ""consolidation"" treatment cycles using HAART methotrexate and leucovorin and then HAART alone. Rituximab is given by intravenous (IV through a vein) day 1 of each cycle. Also on day 1 IV fluids are given to lower acidity in the urine to protect the kidneys from the methotrexate. On day 2 methotrexate is infused through a vein over 4 hours. Starting 24 hours after initiation of the methotrexate infusion leucovorin is given every 3 to 6 hours (first IV and then possibly by mouth) until the drug decreases to a target level in the blood. HAART is begun as soon as possible. The specific HAART regimen for each patient is determined individually. All patients are hospitalized the first week of every 2-week treatment cycle for safety monitoring. In addition to HAART and chemotherapy patients undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  Intellectual functioning: Before starting treatment patients are tested for their ability to understand basic concepts and coordination in order to be able to evaluate how the brain lymphoma affects thinking and concentration. After the lymphoma appears to have resolved more formal and intensive tests are done. The intensive tests are repeated each year and shorter interim tests are done about every 6 months. Also a specialist periodically monitors patients' understanding of HAART and the importance of this therapy.   -  Blood tests: Blood is drawn every day during hospitalizations to measure methotrexate levels and to evaluate kidney and liver function and blood counts. Blood is also drawn before starting therapy when the lymphoma disappears 6 months after completing treatment and any time it appears that the lymphoma may have recurred to test for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) a virus that is almost always present in AIDS-related primary brain lymphoma.   -  Imaging tests: Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans periodically to monitor the effects of treatment on the lymphoma. MRI scans are done after the 2nd 4th 6th and 8th treatments then every 2 months for three times every 3 months for six times every 6 months for four times and then every year for 5 years or sooner if there is a concern about the brain. PET scans are done after the first cycle after the MRI suggests the lymphoma is gone and then yearly.   -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This test is done to look for EBV in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Under local anesthetic a needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord and a small amount of fluid is collected through the needle. This test is done at the same times as the blood tests for EBV.   -  Eye examinations: Patients' eyes are examined periodically because brain lymphoma can sometimes spread to the eye and because some people with AIDS-related primary brain lymphoma are at risk of certain eye infections.

HIV,IPT of Malaria With SP in Different Zones of Drug Resistance in Rwanda, The present study will address the question whether the use of IPT using SP in pregnancy is efficacious in Rwanda where it is going to be used for the first time in areas with high levels of SP resistance. While the implementation of the new policy will take place in areas at low SP resistance level where we expect pregnant women and newborns to benefit from it it is of paramount importance to clarify which is the real impact of IPT/SPin areas of high SP drug resistance and at what level of SP resistance this strategy is still efficacious. As bed nets are a part of the actual control strategy of malaria in pregnancy all women will receive a bed net at enrolment    ,NCT00372632
HIV,Assessment of CMV-specific ELISPOT Assay for Predicting CMV Co-infection in Patients With Pneumocystitis Pneumonia (ACE-PCP), PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) is one of the important opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients including HIV-infected patients transplant recipients and immunosuppressant users. About one third of non-HIV patients with PCP have the evidence of co-infection with CMV. In this difficult clinical situation physicians have difficulty to decide on whether anti-CMV treament will help patients with any evidence of CMV co-infection. However there is no objective test to differentiate true co-infection of CMV from innocent bystander of CMV in those with PCP. The investigators thus evaluate the usefulness of CMV-specific ELISPOT assay in patients with PCP to differentiate true co-infection of CMV from inocent bystander of CMV. This findings may guide physicians to decide anti-CMV treatment in patients with PCP and CMV co-infection.    ,NCT02109887
HIV,Utilizing Computed Tomographic Angiography to Evaluate Coronary Artery Disease in Patients on Long-Term Antiretroviral Therapy, Utilizing Computed Tomographic Angiography to Evaluate Coronary Artery Disease in Patients on Long-Term Antiretroviral Therapy Intro: It is well known that HIV treated with antiretroviral drugs increases the risk for coronary artery disease. Studies have documented this with various methods including analyzing the effects of retroviral therapy on cardiac risk factors such as diabetes lipids and hypertension. Still other studies have looked at carotid and brachial artery intimal thickness. Our study then aims to evaluate the relationship between HIV medications and coronary atherosclerosis using a novel method. Coronary artery CT angiography is a relatively new diagnostic procedure to evaluate heart disease in cardiac patients. We will apply this test to HIV patients on longstanding antiretroviral therapy to directly examine their coronary arteries to assess heart disease. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy will have increased coronary artery disease compared to the general population. Methods: This project will be conducted in collaboration between Florida Heart Center and Associates in infectious Disease - two communities based infectious disease and cardiology practices. We will identify all the HIV positive patients seen within a 1 month timeframe at the infectious disease office. These patients will then be filtered by our exclusion/inclusion criteria. After obtaining informed consent we will draw blood from each patient to gather lab values such as A1C cholesterol inflammatory markers and other markers associated with coronary artery disease. Each enrolled patient will then schedule and receive a 64 slide coronary CTA at Florida Heart Center. The results of the CTA scans will be categorized in mild moderate and severe coronary artery disease. The data then will consist of the parameters measured on blood work and the results of the coronary CTA. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Patients aged 35 to 50 with HIV and on retroviral therapy for at least 5 years. Exclusion Criteria: 1. Patients with prior documented coronary artery disease heart attack stent placement or heart surgery. Statistical Analysis: We will conduct a multivariate analysis on the cardiac risk factors taken from patient history and the bloodwork (diabetes lipids etc) to correlate them with the results of the CTA. We will also conduct basic analysis to support our hypothesis that long term antiretroviral therapy increases coronary artery disease. Funding: The bloodwork and CTA tests ordered in this study will be payed for by insurance companies where available. In cases where insurance companies will not pay Florida Heart Center will pay for the CTA tests and Associates in infectious Disease will fund the bloodwork. Humans Subjects Protection: This will be a projective chart review study that will require access to protected health information. Thus we will seek full IRB approval from the FSU IRB committee with informed consent. An informed consent document will be given to each patient explaining all the risks and benefits of the study in addition to the methods. Recruitment will be done by an office staff or medical assistant not on the research team. After patient recruitment their medical records will be flagged for study and they will undergo the required testing. At completion of testing their results will be recorded in the final data sheet and their medical record will no longer be flagged for study. No identifying data will be recorded in the final data sheet and the data will be stored in an encrypted excel sheet on a secure password protected personal laptop running antivirus and firewall. Third parties (such as family members) will not have access to any research data regardless of authorizations received from the study subjects. All the test results and labwork performed for the study will go into the patient's individual medical record at their respective offices. Thus if an authorized third party wishes to view any test results they can do so via the normal methods at the doctor's office.    ,NCT02191306
HIV,Pediatric HIV Disclosure Intervention, With increased availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and improved care increasing numbers of perinatally infected children are surviving into adolescence. While HIV care and treatment programs are expanding growing challenge faced by health providers and caregivers is diagnosis disclosure to HIV infected children. The investigators propose a 4 year project to test the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioural intervention that the investigators have designed to support developmentally appropriate disclosure to HIV infected children by their caregiver. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will lead to increased disclosure rates and will over time improve health and mental health outcomes among caregivers and children in the intervention group compared to those receiving standard care. The findings of the study will inform Ugandan and other countries' national policies on pediatric HIV care and treatment.    ,NCT01773642
HIV,Couple-oriented Prenatal HIV Counseling in Low and Medium HIV Prevalence Countries, ANRS 12127 Prenahtest is an intervention trial conducted in four countries (Cameroon Dominican Republic Georgia and India) where pregnant women are randomized during prenatal care to receive either standard post-test HIV counseling or an innovative intervention called couple-oriented post-test HIV counseling (COC). The aim of the COC intervention is to empower women to communicate with her male partner about HIV and HIV testing in particular and encourage him to return for HIV testing and/or couple HIV counseling (where both couple members are counseled together). Prenahtest is the first randomised trial testing a prenatal intervention to increase partner HIV testing.    ,NCT01494961

HIV,Equivalence of Boosted Atazanavir Based Regimens and Currently Effective HAART Regimens, The hypothesis for this study is will a treatment regimen containing Atazanavir in combination with Ritonavir work as well as other regimens containing a protease inhibitor (PI one of 5 classes of HIV Medications) and/or a Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI another of the classes of HIV medications) at controlling HIV disease in children who are HIV+ and have high cholesterol or high triglycerides. . In this study children who have high cholesterol or high triglycerides as a result of their HIV medicines will have the PI or NNRTI in their medication regimen changed to Atazanavir which is a PI in combination with a low dose of Ritonavir (another PI). Atazanavir has been shown in adults to result in lower cholesterol and triglycerides than other PI's and NNRTI's. The dose of atazanavir and ritonavir will be according to the Package Insert for this drug that is FDA approved for children. They will continue taking the other medications from the pre-study regimen. Children will take study drug for 24 weeks and will be able to continue study drug after the study using commercially available drug. Lab tests and a physical exam will be undertaken at 4 weeks 12 weeks and 24 weeks after starting study drug to determine how effective the new drug is and to monitor for possible side effects.    ,NCT00940771

HIV,Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a Human Monoclonal Antibody VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS) With Broad HIV-1 Neutralizing Activity Administered Intravenously or Subcutaneously to Healthy Adults, Background: Antibodies help the body fight infection. VRC01LS is an antibody directed against HIV virus. HIV attacks the immune system. In animals VRC01LS inactivated many types of HIV viruses. Researchers want to see if it does this in people. Objectives: To see if VRC01LS is safe and well-tolerated in people. To see what level of VRC01LS is maintained in people and if they develop an immune response to it. Eligibility: Healthy people ages 18 to 50 Design: Participants will be screened in protocol number VRC 500 (NIH 11-I-0164) with medical history physical exam and blood and urine tests. The study will last 24 to 48 weeks. Visits will last 2 to 8 hours. Participants will get VRC01LS through either:   -  A needle in an arm vein or   -  A small needle placed into the fatty tissue under the skin of the abdomen thigh or arm. Participants will be assigned to 1 of 6 groups. Groups 1 to 4 will get 1 dose of VRC01LS. They will have follow-up visits through week 24. Groups 5 and 6 will get 1 dose of VRC01LS every 12 weeks (3 doses). They will have 4 to 5 visits between the second and third dose and follow-up visits through week 48. Participants will have 1 to 3 follow-up visits in the week after receiving VRC01LS. They will record their temperature and keep a diary of symptoms for 3 days after a dose. They may have additional unscheduled visits. At each visit participants will have a physical exam and may have blood and urine tests.    ,NCT02599896
HIV,Safety Study of Ibalizumab Subcutaneous Injection in Healthy Volunteers, The is a blinded safety study of ibalizumab given by subcutaneous injection in sequentially increasing dose-groups of at-risk HIV-negative healthy volunteers. The study involves the administration of four total injections of ibalizumab or matching placebo in each volunteer given once every week at one of three dose levels. Drug administration begins at the lowest dose. After 4 of 8 volunteers in the first group have received all study drug injections and have completed 6 additional weeks of follow-up an independent safety monitoring group will review available data before approving initiation of the next higher dose-group. This process will be repeated prior to initiation of the 3rd and highest dose-group. All volunteers will participate in 2 separate intensive blood sampling periods of 7 days each to test drug levels.    ,NCT01292174
HIV,Effectiveness of an HIV-adapted IMCI Training and Supervision Programme for Community Health Workers, This is a cluster randomized controlled trial (C-RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a Community-Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (C-IMCI) training for community caregivers (CCGs) adapted to include HIV-related interventions on the delivery of maternal newborn and child health interventions within households in rural communities in Ugu District KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province South Africa. The intervention includes two components: (1) a 2-week HIV/C-IMCI training for CCGs and their associated facilitators and supervisors and (2) continuous support and supervision following the continuous quality improvement (CQI) framework a low-technology approach to management and supervision of health programs. The primary objectives of the proposed evaluation are to measure the effect of the intervention on key outcomes including early uptake of antenatal care facility based delivery postnatal visits coverage of exclusive breastfeeding and uptake of HIV PCR testing in infants at 6 weeks. We will also examine the effects of the intervention on immunization uptake up to 12 months and knowledge and practices of CCGs and mothers pertaining to maternal newborn and child health.    ,NCT01774136
HIV,Primary HIV Prevention in Pregnant and Lactating Ugandan Women, This study aims to test the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention aimed at preventing the primary acquisition of HIV by uninfected pregnant and lactating women in Uganda East Africa where HIV transmission is high. Women who acquire HIV during pregnancy or lactation are at higher risk of adverse health and pregnancy outcomes and their baby is at high risk of acquiring HIV and dying. Keeping HIV-uninfected women uninfected during pregnancy and lactation is an important component of the global World Health Organization (WHO) strategy to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV but there has been no study to date to assess interventions that can effectively keep these women uninfected. In this study the investigators will test the hypotheses that:   1. extended repeat HIV testing and enhanced counseling (ERHTEC) during late pregnancy (>36 weeks) and breastfeeding can increase and sustain risk reduction behaviors and prevent incident STI and HIV infections among HIV-uninfected pregnant women and   2. that couple HIV testing and counseling (HTC) can further enhance this effect through improved couple communication and emotional and economic support from male partners.    ,NCT01882998

All patients will receive a behavioral intervention termed Medical Management/Medication Coaching or MM/MC. MM/MC incorporates the behavioral platform Medical Management (MM) from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)-funded COMBINE Study to reduce heavy alcohol use with Medication Coaching (MC) a manualized treatment designed to improve HAART medication adherence in HIV-infected patients with substance use disorders.    ,NCT01227044
HIV,Impact of a Raltegravir-based Regimen on Early Mortality of Severely Immunocompromised AIDS Patients, The current available antiretroviral (ARV) agents make possible a successful treatment of virtually all HIV-infected patients but some problems related to early mortality are still of concern mainly in resources-limited settings. There are several published reports showing that such patients are at a significantly higher risk of death during the first months of treatment in comparison with the observed outcomes in developed countries. One of the consistently detected risks for early mortality across these reports is the baseline low CD4 count although it does not seem to be the only reason for such outcome. In Brazil and other developing countries there is still a large proportion of AIDS patients who are diagnosed with AIDS or only seek health care for HIV infection late in the course of disease. Raltegravir (RAL) the first HIV-1 integrase inhibitor is a potent and safe ARV drug. The available evidence suggest it promotes a faster decline in HIV-1 plasma viremia and a higher increase in CD4 cells count in comparison with those in Efavirenz (EFV) arm. The investigators propose to compare the impact of RAL versus EFV in the early mortality rates for severely ill (CD4+ cells count <50 cells/mm3) patients starting ARV therapy.    ,NCT01837277
HIV,Effect Study of a Theory-Based Internet Intervention on Safe-Sex Practices, The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a theory based online tailored intervention on stimulating safe-sex practices among men who have sex with men (MSM). Our hypothesis was that a tailored internet intervention would be more effective in stimulating safe-sex practices of gay men than a non-tailored internet intervention when compared to a waiting-list control group.    ,NCT00378885
HIV,Improving Identification of Social Harm Among Substance Abusers in HIV Trials, This two-phased project will develop a comprehensive audio computer assisted self-administered interview social harm questionnaire (ACASI-SHQ) that will allow researchers to more easily identify and monitor social harms experienced by substance abusers participating in HIV-related trials. The ACASI-SHQ will (1) reduce the likelihood of socially desirable responding (2) include items with high levels of specificity to increase the likelihood of identifying social harms (construct validity) and (3) utilize a self-interview format that will increase the likelihood of its adoption by HIV researchers. The investigators will then evaluate its feasibility acceptability and preliminary utility and construct validity in an ongoing HIV-related trial.    ,NCT02148276
HIV,Safety Tolerability & Efficacy on LDL-C of Evolocumab in Subjects With HIV & Hyperlipidemia/Mixed Dyslipidemia, The study is divided into 2 parts. The first part of the study will be double-blinded and will last for 24 weeks. During this time subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either Repatha (evolocumab) QM or placebo QM. The second part of the study is a 24-week open label extension period. During this time all subjects will receive Repatha (evolocumab) QM. The clinical hypothesis is that subcutaneous Repatha (evolocumab) QM will be well tolerated and will result in greater reduction of LDL-C defined as percent change from baseline at week 24 compared with placebo QM in HIV-positive subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.    ,NCT02833844

HIV,Targeted Nurse-driven HIV Screening in Emergency Departments, To reduce late HIV diagnosis that remains common in France the national health agency has promoted non-targeted HIV screening in health care settings including emergency departments (EDs). In our previous survey non-targeted nurse-driven HIV screening by rapid tests was feasible well-accepted but identified only a few new HIV diagnoses mostly among patients at high-risk. Our findings consistent with results from other international groups suggest that a targeted strategy could be feasible efficient and cost-effective with fewer tests required. However the feasibility and the efficacy of this strategy remain unknown in France. The main aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of 2 strategies: 1) the combination of the nurse-driven HIV targeted screening and the current practice (physician-directed HIV diagnostic testing) versus 2) the current practice alone. The strategies will be compared during 2 randomly assigned periods (cluster randomization and cross-over) in 8 EDs of metropolitan Paris. During targeted period nurses will offer screening to all patients at EDs aged 18-64 years old identified as high-risk by a self-administered questionnaire not know to be HIV positive not being seen for post-exposure prophylaxis or unstable medical illness and accepting to participate by providing an informed consent. In case of confirmed reactive rapid test result a follow-up visit with an on-site infectious disease specialist will be arranged within the following 48 hours.    ,NCT02127424
