Breast Cancer,Phase II Study With the Trifunctional Antibody Ertumaxomab to Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer Progressing After Endocrine Treatment, The purpose of the study is to demonstrate clinical efficacy of the investigational trifunctional bispecific antibody ertumaxomab for treatment of patients with HER-2/neu 1+ or 2+ (FISH-) expressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer (stage III b/IV) which has progressed after endocrine therapy. Ertumaxomab is a trifunctional bispecific antibody targeting Her-2/neu and CD3 on T cells. Trifunctional antibodies represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new antibody class has the capability to redirect T cells and accessory cells (e.g. macrophages dendritic cells [DCs] and natural killer [NK] cells) to the tumor site. According to preclinical data trifunctional antibodies activate these immune cells which can trigger a complex anti-tumor immune response.    ,NCT00452140

Breast Cancer,A Phase II Combination of Trastuzumab and Ixabepilone Versus Trastuzumab and Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer, The purpose of this randomized Phase 2 open-label study was to assess the response rate of participants with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (Her2+) locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer (not previously treated with chemotherapy or trastuzumab) to treatment with ixabepilone plus trastuzumab and/or docetaxel plus trastuzumab.    ,NCT00490646
Breast Cancer,ZD6474 (Zactima) and Metronomic Chemotherapy in Advanced Breast Cancer, The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of Zactima with metronomic chemotherapy. Zactima is an oral anti-angiogenesis drug which means it fights cancer by cutting off a tumor's blood supply. Thus the drug starves the tumor by preventing the delivery of nutrients and oxygen. Metronomic chemotherapy is low dose oral chemotherapy pills which are taken daily. Unlike traditional chemotherapy metronomic chemotherapy is thought to fight cancer like Zactima by cutting off the blood supply to tumors. Because the dose is very low the side effects are generally mild and very different from those with higher dose chemotherapy given by vein.    ,NCT00496665
Breast Cancer,PTC299 and Hormonal Agent for Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer, Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is important for tumor growth in metastatic breast cancer. It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there are higher levels of VEGF in the tumors and blood of many women with metastatic breast cancer. VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral drug that has been shown to decrease production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models oral PTC299 administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream decreases blood vessel numbers in the tumor and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. Safety studies in research animals indicate good tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than those planned for the clinical studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers indicate that PTC299 achieves levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active in animal models of human cancer. This Phase 1b study is designed to test the hypothesis that PTC299 will be tolerable and will show evidence of VEGF reduction and antitumor activity when administered orally in combination with anastrozole (ArimidexÂ®) letrozole (FemaraÂ®) or exemestane (AromasinÂ®) to women with metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT00508586

Breast Cancer,Phase II Study With the Trifunctional Antibody Ertumaxomab to Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer After Progression on Trastuzumab Therapy, This study has the purpose to demonstrate clinical efficacy of the investigational new drug ertumaxomab in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2/neu) overexpressing (3+ or 2+ with a positive Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) test result) metastatic breast cancer progressing after trastuzumab treatment. Ertumaxomab is a trifunctional bispecific antibody targeting Her-2/neu on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells. Trifunctional antibodies represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new antibody class has the capability to redirect T cells and accessory immune effector cells (e.g. macrophages dendritic cells [DCs] and natural killer [NK] cells) to the tumor site. According to preclinical data trifunctional antibodies activate these immune cells which can trigger a complex anti-tumor immune response.    ,NCT00522457

Breast Cancer,ZK 230211 in Postmenopausal Woman With Metastatic Breast Cancer, Randomized phase II study to investigate the efficacy safety and tolerability of ZK 230211 (100 mg vs. 25 mg) as second-line endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.Once the cancer has spread beyond the lymph nodes to areas such as e.g. the skin soft tissues lung and liver it is called metastatic breast cancer. Patients who have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that has progressed since their previous cancer treatment and that cannot be removed completely by surgery are eligible to be treated within this trial.Treatment with a new drug called Progesterone Receptor Antagonist ZK 230211 (ZK PRA) targets the progesterone receptor which may be expressed on breast cancer tumour cells. Therefore only patients with this progesterone receptor on their tumour cells can be included in this study.Progesterone receptor antagonists (including onapristone) have already shown efficacy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer (Klijn et al. 2000). This phase II study investigates the efficacy (proof of concept) safety and tolerability of ZK PRA at two dose levels (25 mg and 100 mg) before initiating pivotal phase III trials.    ,NCT00555919

Breast Cancer,Phase I/II Study of MK-0752 Followed by Docetaxel in Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer," New and better therapies for locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer are needed because even if standard treatment is successful in shrinking the cancer there is still a high chance that the cancer will recur. Recent research suggests that breast tumors have a small number of cells in them that are ""breast cancer stem cells"" which are very resistant to standard treatment. It is thought that the reason that many patients cannot be cured of their breast cancers is that the stem cells are unable to be killed and remain in the body after standard treatment. Laboratory research has shown that a new drug MK-0752 can target stem cells and prevent tumor recurrences when the drug is combined with docetaxel a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat breast cancer. We know that MK-0752 is safe when given by itself to people. We do not know if treatment with MK-0752 and docetaxel combined is safe or if it will kill ""breast cancer stem cells"" in people with breast cancer. This clinical trial is being done to determine the safety of several doses of MK-0752 in combination with docetaxel. Preliminary data about the effectiveness of MK-0752 in combination with docetaxel will be collected. Also tumor biopsy samples will be taken from some patients who have tumors that can be easily biopsied. The samples will be used to perform research tests to help determine if the ""breast cancer stem cells"" are being killed by the drug combination.    ",NCT00645333

Breast Cancer,Therapy of Metastatic Breast Cancer With Paclitaxel and Liposomal Doxorubicin, Today metastatic breast cancer is regarded as cureless. The treatment is palliative in intent and the goals of treatment include improvement of quality of life and if possible prolongation of life. Treatment in metastatic cancer will usually involve hormone therapy and/or chemotherapy. Weekly application of chemotherapeutical drugs may lead to less drug concentrations in healthy tissue and therefore toxicities maÃ½ be reduced.    ,NCT00691912

Breast Cancer,A Phase I Cancer Vaccine Study for Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer," The study uses a molecule or particle that is found only on cancer cells and is unique to cancer cells as it is not detected on normal tissue. The molecule is known as ""oncofetal antigen"" or OFA. Because OFA is unique to cancer the investigators feel OFA could be used to educate the patients' own defenses to more effectively fight the cancer on her own he or she is harboring. Although investigators found OFA to be present in large concentrations on all cancers it was found to be especially abundant in breast cancers. Therefore the investigators feel that this molecule would be a good target for stimulating patient defenses especially against breast cancer cells. To accomplish this certain defense cells (immune cells) will be washed out from the patients' blood using a machine to which the patient is connected through two small cannulas placed into veins located in the patients' arms. Those cells will be manipulated in the laboratory with artificially engineered OFA. These ""reeducated"" cells will be injected into the skin of patients. There will be a series of three skin injections in 4 week intervals. It is hoped that this treatment will convert the patients' defenses to a point that effective anti cancer responses will be induced. Effectiveness of the treatment will be monitored with blood tests and assessment of the size of the cancers.    ",NCT00715832

Breast Cancer,A Study for Safety and Effectiveness of IMC-A12 by Itself or Combined With Antiestrogens to Treat Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to determine whether IMC-A12 offers increased progression-free survival (PFS) associated with IMC-A12 monotherapy and IMC-A12 in combination with an antiestrogen therapy in patients with hormone receptor positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer that have experienced disease progression on antiestrogen therapy.    ,NCT00728949
Breast Cancer,Faslodex Registry: Fulvestrant in Current Clinical Practice, The sequential administration of endocrine therapies to patients with advanced breast cancer requires the availability of therapies with different modes of actions so that tumours developing resistance to one agent are not cross resistant to another. Because of its mechanism of action fulvestrant is distinct from other hormonal therapies which therefore limits the possibility of cross-resistance with other therapies such as tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors (AIs)   -  In this way patients may benefit from an extended period of endocrine treatment which has considerable tolerability and quality-of-life advantages over cytotoxic chemotherapy.   -  In Belgium fulvestrant is indicated for treating postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with recurrence during or after adjuvant anti-oestrogen therapy or disease progression during anti-oestrogen treatment. However little information is currently available on how fulvestrant is actually being used by physicians in Belgium. The optimum sequence of endocrine treatment for advanced breast cancer has yet to be defined and may depend on certain patient or disease characteristics. Fulvestrant has been granted reimbursement by the Belgian Health authorities (RIZIV/INAMI) with the recommendation to collect the real life data necessary to assess the patients' breast cancer treatment history that may influence the actual endocrine treatment sequence according to physicians current clinical practice..    ,NCT00735215
Breast Cancer,Lapatinib in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Failed Prior Antihormone Therapy, Hormone receptor positive breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer comprising 70-80% of all breast cancers. Endocrine therapy is the main type of initial treatment for patients with your type of breast cancer. Endocrine therapy is treatment that tries to remove or block certain hormones from binding to the cancer cells and thus slow or stop the growth of cancer. Although most patients with your type of breast cancer respond initially to endocrine therapies it can lose its effectiveness. New therapies for this type of cancer are needed.    ,NCT00759642

Breast Cancer,Carboplatin and Bevacizumab for Progressive Breast Cancer Brain Metastases, The purpose of this research study is to determine how well the combination of bevacizumab and carboplatin works in treating breast cancer that has spread to the brain. Bevacizumab is an antibody (a protein that attacks a foreign substance in the body) that is made in the laboratory. Bevacizumab works differently from the way chemotherapy drugs work. Usually chemotherapy drugs attack fast growing cancer cells in the body. Bevacizumab works to slow or stop the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors. When the blood supply is decreased the tumors don't get the oxygen and nutrients they need to grow. Carboplatin is in a class of drugs known as platinum-containing compounds and has been approved for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Information from other research studies suggests that the combination of bevacizumab with carboplatin may be effective in treating breast cancer.    ,NCT01004172

Breast Cancer,Evaluating Lapatinib + Capecitabine in Patients Aged 70 and Over With HER2 Metastatic Breast Cancer.," GERICO 09/0907 is a Phase II multicentric trial evaluating the toxicity and activity of the combination of lapatinib and capecitabine in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer over expressing HER2 for patients aged ??70 who have failed after one line of chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab. Due to the minimal participation of older people in clinical trials there is a lack of data to make evidence-based decisions regarding chemotherapy in this indication. The study is designed to investigate whether elderly patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer over-expressing HER2 could take advantage of the combination lapatinib and capecitabine in term of clinical benefit and with no adverse effects and no detrimental impact on functional status (part of geriatric assessment). The main objective is to assess clinical benefit (defined at 4 months as complete response partial response or stable disease) safety and preserved geriatric independence (main objective is a ""bi-criteria"" or composite criteria).

Breast Cancer,Fulvestrant (F)/Goserelin (G) vs Anastrozole (A)/G vs G for Premenopausal Women, Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist with no agonist effects which binds blocks and degrades the ER. Fulvestrant is comparable to third-generation aromatase inhibitors in terms of efficacy and tolerability for patients who have progressed on prior tamoxifen therapy and past studies have found all three-third-generation AIs to be at least as good as tamoxifen in first-line metastatic therapy in postmenopausal women. Fulvestrant has been studied little in premenopausal women despite of its attractive mechanism of actions. The clinical effectiveness of fulvestrant as a treatment for advanced breast cancer has previously been demonstrated at the standard dose (AD; 250 mg/mo) in several phase III clinical trials in postmenopausal women. However there is evidence to suggest that doses of fulvestrant higher than 250 mg may have greater pharmacodynamic activity against the ER pathway. Moreover dose-dependent clinical activity has been observed for fulvestrant. The activity of a fulvestrant high-dose (HD; 500 mg/mo) regimen has been investigated in two recent studies. A pilot Japanese study showed fulvestrant HD to have clinical activity in the treatment of advanced or recurrent breast cancer to be well tolerated and to result in plasma levels approximately double those seen with fulvestrant low-dose. Subsequently a neoadjuvant study comparing fulvestrant low-dose and high-dose reported that significantly greater Ki67 and ER downregulation was achieved with the high-dose compared with the low-dose regimen and that both doses were well tolerated. A recent randomized trial also showed superior outcome of high-dose fulvestrant than AI. Based on this rationale we introduced high-dose fulvestrant with LHRH agonist as a randomized trial comparing with AI plus LHRH agonist and LHRH alone in premenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients who failed to tamoxifen treatment.    ,NCT01266213

Breast Cancer,High Throughput Technologies to Drive Breast Cancer Patients to Specific Phase I/II Trials of Targeted Agents," High sensitivity to targeted agents has been observed in patients whose tumor cells present a genetic/genomic deregulation of the target (Kit mutation ERBB2 amplification EGFR mutations) together with addiction to the given target. More recently activation of ""alternative pathways"" (Kras mutation PI3K mutations) have been reported as a common resistance mechanism to single agent tyrosine kinase inhibitors (trastuzumab cetuximab). From these data has emerged the hypothesis that identification of the deregulated pathway through new molecular tools could allow to propose a more tailored targeted regimen. Based on these concepts numbers of phase I/II trials enrich their populations in patients presenting specific molecular alterations. High throughput technologies (array CGH sequencing gene expression array) identify deregulated genes. In addition these technologies determine whether such genomic alterations are single (expected efficacy of single agent) or multiple (rationale for combination). In a pilot study that included 135 patients we recently performed a combination of array CGH and hot spot mutation array in order to drive patients into phase I/II clinical trials. This study led to the conclusions that high throughput technologies i. are feasible (80%) and robust ii. identify ""targetable"" genomic alterations in around 40% of samples. In the present study the investigators will perform high throughput technologies to drive 400 metastatic breast cancer patients into specific phase I/II trials.    ",NCT01414933

Breast Cancer,Nab-paclitaxel in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Failing Solvent Based Taxane (Tiffany), Nab-paclitaxel has demonstrated to be an active agent in breast cancer and probably a less toxic alternative to solvent based taxanes. It is indicated in metastatic breast cancer after failure of anthracyclines. However most patients receive anthracyclines as well as taxanes as part of their (neo-)adjuvant therapy. There is currently no standard treatment for patients with an early relapse (<12 months) after a taxane containing (neo-)adjuvant therapy. Nab-paclitaxel a novel nano-particle encapsulated paclitaxel is expected to have only limited cross-resistant to solvent-based taxanes and might therefore be indicated in this setting.    ,NCT01416558
Breast Cancer,Weekly Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab in Metastatic Breast Cancer, The 3 weekly combination of trastuzumab and paclitaxel has been approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer based on a large pivotal study. However mono and combination chemotherapy trials suggest that weekly paclitaxel has a better therapeutic index especially in the palliative setting. The present trial examines the efficacy and safety of weekly paclitaxel over a limited duration combined with continued trastuzumab in HER2+ patients.    ,NCT01423695
Breast Cancer,Epirubicin and Paclitaxel Alone or Together With Capecitabine as First Line Treatment in Metastatic Breast Cancer, Anthracycline-taxane regimens are effective means of postponing progression in metastatic breast cancer. It is yet unclear whether addition of capecitabine to this combination improves the treatment outcome. Patients with advanced breast cancer are randomized to first-line chemotherapy with a combination of epirubicin (FarmorubicinÂ®) and paclitaxel (TaxolÂ®) alone (ET) or in combination with capecitabine (XelodaÂ® TEX). Starting doses for ET are epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and for TEX epirubicin 75mg/m2 paclitaxel 155 mg/m2 and capecitabine 825 mg/m2 BID for 14 days. Subsequently doses are tailored related to side effects. Primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS) time to treatment failure (TTF) objective response (OR) safety and quality of life (QoL).    ,NCT01433614

Breast Cancer,Pazopanib in Combination With Capecitabine in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, Angiogenesis is essential for the growth of large tumor. A number of anti-angiogenic agents are currently under development. Bevacizumab a humanised monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to improve disease free survival in first line metastatic breast cancer when associated with chemotherapy 1. Results of a randomised phase II trial combining sorafenib a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting multiple tyrosine kinases including VEGFR1 VEGFR2 VEGFR3 with capecitabine have recently been reported 2. Compared to capecitabine plus placebo progression-free survival in the capecitabine + sorafenib arm was significantly increased from 4.1 months to 6.4 months. Toxicities were also increased with an incidence rate of grade 3/4 hand foot syndrome of 45% in the capecitabine + sorafenib arm compared to 13% in the capecitabine + placebo arm. The increased toxicity will most likely limit the clinical use of this regimen. Pazopanib is a potent multi-targeted TKI of VEGFR-1 -2 -3 PDGFR-Î± and -Î² and c-kit and has recently been approved for the treatment of renal cell cancer in the U.S. In the EU a positive opinion has been issued by the European Medicines Agency. A phase II study of GW786034 (pazopanib) in patients with recurrent or metastatic invasive breast carcinoma included 19 patients after a maximum of 2 lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease 3. Pazopanib 800 mg daily was given continuously. A clinically significant rate of stable disease (58%) was detected with a median TTP of 5.3 months (95% CI: 1.8 - 9.0 months). Four patients treated with pazopanib had SD for ??6 months for a clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as rate of SD for ??6 months or CR or PR of 5/19 (26%) which is at least comparable to sunitinib and bevacizumab (CBR 16% and 17% respectively). The pivotal study of full dose (800 mg) daily pazopanib in renal cell cancer reported hand foot syndrome of all grades in only 6% of patients 4. The optimally tolerated regimen (OTR) of pazopanib was determined when administered in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced CRC 5. In patients who received capecitabine (850 mg twice daily) plus 800 mg once daily pazopanib combined with oxaliplatin the incidence of hand foot syndrome of all grades was 24%. The present study will investigate the combination of pazopanib and capecitabine in advanced or metastatic breast cancer with the aim to develop a new treatment option with increased efficacy and tolerability.    ,NCT01498458

Breast Cancer,Efficacy and Tolerability of Eribulin Plus Lapatinib in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer (E-VITA), -  Lapatinib in combination with capecitabine has been approved for the treatment of women with HER-2-positive advanced breast cancer that have progressed after anthracycline- taxane- and trastuzumab-containing therapies. The use of this combination is limited by overlapping toxicity such as diarrhea and cutaneous side effects.   -  A significant number of patients receive today capecitabine with trastuzumab as first- or second-line treatment. Therefore other combinations of lapatinib with less toxic cytotoxic agents are needed.   -  Eribulin mesylate (E7389) is a synthetic analog of Halichondrin B (HalB) a large polyether macrolide isolated from a marine sponge. Eribulin is a mechanistically unique antagonist of microtubule dynamics among tubulin-targeted agents leading to inhibition of microtubule growth in the absence of effects on microtubule shortening and formation of non- productive tubulin aggregates.   -  Eribulin mesylate at a dose of 1.4 mg/mÂ² given on day 1 8 every 3 weeks has shown better overall survival by 2.5 months compared to treatment of physicians choice in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who were previously treated for 2-5 lines with anthracyclines taxanes and capecitabine (EMBRACE study).   -  The most frequently reported eribulin-related AEs were asthenia/fatigue (65%) alopecia (60%) neutropenia (60%) nausea (44%) anemia (28%) pyrexia (23%) leucopenia (22%) anorexia (21%) constipation (19%) vomiting (18%) and peripheral neuropathy (5.5%; only grade 3). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 32% of patients and febrile neutropenia occurred in 5.5% of patients. The frequency of all other grade 3/4 AEs was less than 3%. This toxicity profile does not overlap with that of lapatinib.   -  There is uncertainty in how far a once every 3 week schedule of eribulin mesylate at a dose of 2.0 mg/mÂ² would be better tolerated. Several phase II studies are currently conducted in various non-breast cancer indications to compare the d1+8 q d21 with a d1 q d21 schedule.   -  The aim of this randomized phase II study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two dose-schedules of eribulin plus lapatinib in HER2-positive breast cancer pre-treated with trastuzumab in the adjuvant and/or metastatic setting.    ,NCT01534455

Breast Cancer,Effect of a Goal Setting Intervention on Exercise in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer: An Exploration of The Lipogenic Pathway, This study is a randomized prospective clinical trial of women with metastatic breast cancer. The purpose of the study is to test if an intervention of regular physical activity review and physical activity goal setting will allow the subjects to achieve a moderate increase in physical activity of 6000 steps per week. The physical activity review will consist of weekly telephone call to inquire about symptoms and to set physical activity goals. The study will also look to see if the goal setting intervention will affect the time to progression change in BMI and quality of life. Quality of life will be measured by answers to questionnaires provided to subjects at regular intervals during the course of the study. Finally the study will examine the impact of physical activity on expression of tumor molecular molecules insulin levels and estradiol levels. Through an intervention of regular physical activity review and goal setting the investigators hypothesize that a moderate increase in level of physical activity of 6000 steps per week or more can be obtained by patients with metastatic breast cancer who receive a goal setting intervention. The investigators propose that those who are able to achieve and maintain greater than or equal to 22500 steps per week will demonstrate biologic and molecular differences compared to those who are not able to achieve that level of physical activity. The investigators expect that people who are more active will have longer to progression.    ,NCT01653366

Breast Cancer,Study of Fulvestrant +/- Everolimus in Post-Menopausal Hormone-Receptor + Metastatic Breast Ca Resistant to AI," Post-menopausal women with hormone-receptor positive (HR+) metastatic breast cancer resistant to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy will be randomized to receive Fulvestrant (Faslodex) with Everolimus or Fulvestrant (Faslodex) with a placebo (no active ingredients). Fulvestrant has demonstrated activity when used as first second or third line endocrine therapy making it an attractive therapy for combination with other agents. In addition it is commonly reserved for use following disease progression on AI therapy. Everolimus is an orally administered drug that blocks a signaling pathway called ""mTOR"". ""mTOR"" acts as a regulator for many processes in the body including cell growth. Blocking this pathway may have an effect on cell growth. The combination of a novel class of agents (mTOR inhibitors) and an established standard treatment for metastatic HR+ breast cancer may potentially increase the clinical benefit by targeting multiple different biological pathways.

Breast Cancer,Clinical Value of 89Zr-trastuzumab PET, Information about the presence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in tumor lesions in breast cancer patients is essential for diagnostic and therapeutic management of metastatic breast cancer. In daily practice however obtaining a metastasis biopsy can be difficult or impracticable. Therefore clinicians can be faced with a persistent clinical dilemma in some breast cancer patients leading to suboptimal therapy decisions due to lack of HER2 receptor information. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) which may provide additional information have so far not been able to replace the biopsy. To solve this problem non-invasive whole body visualization and quantification of HER2 expression by means of the HER2-PET may be a valuable tool. In this prospective multicenter imaging study eligible patients will receive one HER2-PET and CTC analysis in addition to standard work up for metastatic disease. Subsequent administration of anti-HER2 therapy will be evaluated. Referring physicians fill in three questionnaires one before HER2-PET and two after HER2-PET.    ,NCT01832051
Breast Cancer,Trastuzumab & Pertuzumab Followed by T-DM1 in MBC, In HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer trastuzumab based treatment is the standard of care as long as there are no contraindications to trastuzumab. Frequently trastuzumab is being combined with taxanes in the first-line setting. However since therapy with trastuzumab is active even in the absence of chemotherapy in HER2-positive MBC the optimal treatment strategy either in combination or in sequence with chemotherapy is still under debate. This randomized phase II trial is studying a new strategy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with HER2-positive. First-line treatment consists of trastuzumab and pertuzumab a treatment without chemotherapy. In case of disease progression chemotherapy with T-DM1 is then performed as second-line treatment. Third-line and further line therapies are performed according to the physician's discretion. If this new therapeutic strategy is as effective and better tolerated than the conventional strategy this would mean a serious breakthrough in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT01835236

Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer Molecular Analysis Protocol," This is a molecular testing study for patients with metastatic breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to find defects in the DNA of the cancer that could potentially be treated with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved or investigational drugs. For example if your cancer has a mutation in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene (a mutation is a change int he DNA sequence of a gene) that makes this receptor ""superactive"" a drug that inhibits this receptor may also inhibit the growth of the cancer. If this genetic defect is not present in the cancer the same drug may not work. This EGFR gene mutation based patient selection for treatment has worked in lung cancer and we are testing its value in breast cancer. What drugs may be available against particular genetic abnormalities in the context of this clinical study will change over time.    ",NCT01855503

Breast Cancer,IMaging PAtients for Cancer Drug selecTion - Metastatic Breast Cancer, Current patient work-up including conventional imaging and pathological assessment of just one single biopsy might be insufficient to identify metastatic breast cancer patients who possibly benefit from first-line anti-hormonal or anti-HER2 therapy. As receptor conversion of the tumor is found quite frequently and molecular heterogeneity can occur within one patient up-to-date whole body information is necessary to determine estrogen receptor (ER) and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor status and subsequently guide therapy decision. With molecular imaging via PET this information can be obtained in a non-invasive patient friendly way. Furthermore to improve and individualize treatment and be able to identify (new) drug targets and biomarkers sampling of venous blood circulating tumor cells (CTC) as well as circulating tumor DNA microRNA (miRNA) and molecular characterization of one metastasis at the beginning and if feasible of an additional biopsy during therapy is necessary.    ,NCT01957332

Breast Cancer,AR and ER Imaging in Metastatic Breast Cancer, Knowledge of breast cancer estrogen receptor (ER) expression is of major importance in treatment-decision making. Patients with ER-positive tumors can be treated with anti-oestrogen therapy which has relatively few side effects compared to chemotherapy. Whole-body tumor ER-expression can be visualized by 18F-fluoroestradiol PET imaging (FES-PET). In addition to ER the androgen receptor (AR) is a potential new target in breast cancer. PET imaging with 18F-fluorodihydrotestosterone (18F-FDHT) may allow visualization of tumor AR-expression. In the current study we will perform FES-PET and FDHT-PET in metastatic breast cancer patients and evaluate the concordance with concurrent biopsies. Molecular imaging of tumor AR- and ER-expression may well be of value for future treatment decision-making.    ,NCT01988324

Breast Cancer,Orteronel as Monotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) That Expresses the Androgen Receptor (AR), The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in 70-90 percent of primary breast tumors and in 75 percent of breast metastases. There is evidence to suggest that Androgen Receptor (AR) may be a target in patients with advanced breast cancer. Breast cancer patients whose tumors do not express the ER PR or HER2 (triple negative) have very few options for treatment. Orteronel is being developed as an endocrine therapy for relevant hormone-sensitive cancers such as prostrate cancer and breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,Phase II Study Using Genomic & Proteomic Profiling to Influence Treatments for Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer," Genes are the basic ""instruction book"" for the cells that make up our bodies and are made out of DNA. Many research studies are done to find the best possible way to treat patients with cancer. Recently there has been a great deal of interest in developing new anticancer agents that are more targeted to a patient's individual genetic information as well as diseases caused by defects in a person's genes. Identification of precisely which treatments to use against a specific patient's tumor is challenging. In this study four cutting-edge technologies will be used to identify genomic (information we get from DNA and RNA) and proteomic (information we get from proteins) targets for the treatment of your tumor. These four tests will be used together to gather information about your tumor giving doctors and scientists a better understanding of the structure of your tumor and what the best treatment or combination of treatments may be for you. The therapy you receive to treat your tumor will be based on your medical history previous treatments for your disease if applicable current state of health and the findings from these four tests. The therapy you ultimately receive will be selected by your doctor in consultation with a panel of experts in cancer and cancer genomics (the Treatment Selection Committee).    ",NCT02008994

Breast Cancer,TDM1 With Abraxane and Lapatinib for Metastatic HER2 Positive Breast Cancer, This open-label single-center study will assess the safety and tolerability of combining trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) to Lapatinib and Abraxane in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will receive Abraxane on Day 1 of each 1-week cycle and T-DM1 on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Patients with take Lapatinib orally daily. Anticipated time on study treatment is up to 12 weeks for patients metastatic breast cancer until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Subjects may continue on treatment past 12 weeks if responding to study treatment. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Trastuzumab Emtansine in combination with Abraxane and Lapatinib at different dose levels. The investigators are proposing in this phase Ib study to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Trastuzumab Emtansine in combination with Lapatinib plus Abraxane in metastatic Her2 over-expressed breast cancer. The investigators hypothesize that combining antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab-emtansine and lapatinib together with Abraxane will improve clinical efficacy by affecting both PI3K and ERK12 MAPK pathways.    ,NCT02073916

Breast Cancer,AURORA: Aiming to Understand the Molecular Aberrations in Metastatic Breast Cancer.," This program initially aims to recruit 1300 breast cancer patients from a large number of hospitals across Europe. Eligible patients are those who are 18 or older either female or male and who have not received more than 1 type of treatment from the time metastases were discovered metastasi(e)s has just been diagnosed or their disease has come back (disease relapse). Biopsy samples from both the primary and metastatic (or relapsed) tumor will be collected for central analyses together with blood serum and plasma samples. Any samples not analyzed immediately will be stored in an independent bio-repository to enable future (not yet defined) research aimed at better understanding metastatic breast cancer. In summary the main objectives of AURORA are to better understand the genetic aberrations in metastatic breast cancer and to discover the mechanisms of response or resistance to therapy in order to ultimately identify the ""right therapy for each individual patient"". At the same time patients with genetic aberrations that are being targeted by new drugs in development will be offered the possibility to participate in clinical trials when approved and available in their countries. Ultimately the aim of AURORA is to improve the outcomes of all patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer.    ",NCT02102165

Breast Cancer,Rapid Medical Donation Programme for Breast Cancer, Treatment of breast cancer has traditionally been based on the primary tumour's features in the breast. Only recently when cancer returns at other sites has there been an attempt to biopsy the metastatic disease and change treatments accordingly. A 'repeat biopsy' can be technically difficult painful and when possible only represents a small sample of one of many metastases. Even when one deposit responds to a new treatment a neighbouring one may continue to grow. There is an urgent need to characterise all deposits particularly the lethal ones which progress despite all treatments. This study will enable the comprehensive analysis of the metastatic process and the evolution of the breast cancer through the course of its treatment. Patients who have consented during life to donate their tissues for molecular analysis will provide the means for such an analysis. Main aims:   -  To comprehensively and systematically examine metastatic breast cancer by its detailed exploratory molecular characterization to elucidate the possible inter- and intratumoural heterogeneity between the primary tumour and the majority of metastatic sites.   -  To map the natural history of the metastatic breast cancer process    ,NCT02126800
Breast Cancer,Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody in Advanced Trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive Breast Cancer," A significant amount of preclinical and correlative clinical data suggest that HER2-positive breast cancer could be amenable to immuneÂ¬therapeutic approaches. The presence of HER2-overexpression in breast cancers is associated with higher levels of proliferation high histologic grade and higher levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) compared with HER2-negative tumors. The investigators therefore hypothesize that for HER2-positive tumors avoidance of destruction by the host immune system must be an important mechanism contributing to tumor growth and progression. The term ""immune evasion"" refers to the ability of the tumor to suppress and change host anti-tumor immune reactions. The programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway represents a major immune control switch which may be engaged by tumor cells to overcome active T-cell immune surveillance. The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in various tumors. High expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (and to a lesser extent of PD-L2) has been found to correlate with poor prognosis and survival in various other solid tumor types. Furthermore PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-cell expansion in patients with malignant melanoma. These observations suggest that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in the tumor immune evasion and could be considered an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in several solid organ types. MK-3475 (previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly-selective humanized mAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. MK-3475 strongly enhances T lymphocyte immune responses in cultured blood cells from healthy human donors cancer patients and primatesMK-3475 also modulates the level of interleukin-2 (IL-2) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) interferon gamma (IFNÎ³) and other cytokines. The investigators therefore propose to evaluate if the addition of an immunotherapy can reverse trastuzumab resistance and improve clinical outcomes in HER2-positive disease. In this study the investigators will determine if a monoclonal antibody targeted against PD-1 a T cell negative regulator can reverse trastuzumab resistance in patients previously progressing on trastuzumab.

Breast Cancer,A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Trastuzumab Emtansine Versus the Combination of Trastuzumab Plus Docetaxel in Patients With HER2-positive Breast Cancer, This is a Phase III randomized multicenter multinational two-arm open-label clinical trial to investigate a first-line treatment of participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. The study will enroll patients with HER2-positive unresectable locally advanced breast cancer (BC) if they have recurrent disease or progressive disease (PD) despite primary multi-modality therapy and/or metastatic BC if they have not received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. Eligible participants at up to approximately 40 sites in the Asia-Pacific region will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab emtansine (Arm A) or trastuzumab plus docetaxel (Arm B). All study drugs will be administered at in-clinic visits occurring every three weeks during the treatment phase. Trastuzumab plus docetaxel was chosen as the comparator in the control group (Arm B) as it represents a common first-line treatment option used in this patient population in China and other Asia-Pacific countries.    ,NCT02144012

Breast Cancer,Safety and Efficacy Study of Eribulin in Combination With Bevacizumab for Second-line Treatment HER2- MBC Patients, In the second-line treatment setting for MBC many agents including antitubulin drugs (Taxanes Vinorelbine) and antimetabolites (Capecitabine Gemcitabine) have demonstrated activity but no agent is clearly superior. Although some combinations of cytotoxic agents provide a small progression-free survival advantage none has demonstrated an OS advantage and toxicity is generally greater than for single agents. At present there is no standard for this treatment setting. New treatments that could delay disease progression without systemic toxicity would represent a significant advancement.    ,NCT02175446
Breast Cancer,ER Reactivation Therapy for Breast Cancer, Before anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen were developed to treat estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer high-dose estrogen therapies were used. This seems counterintuitive since anti-estrogens block ER function while estrogens increase ER function but these therapies are effective to similar extents for the treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer. Estrogen therapies are most effective against cancers that develop resistance to anti-estrogens likely because such cancers have adapted to grow without ER function and restoring ER function (with estrogen) is damaging to the cancer cells. In some patients with ER+ breast cancer that becomes resistant to anti-estrogens treatment with the estrogen 17b-estradiol induces tumor response. Furthermore when 17b-estradiol-sensitive tumors eventually become resistant to 17b-estradiol switching back to anti-estrogen therapy is often effective. These observations suggest that cancers can alternate between anti-estrogen-sensitive and 17b-estradiol-sensitive states. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with alternating 17b-estradiol / anti-estrogen therapies on a defined 8-week / 16-week schedule will more effectively prevent cancer growth than continuous treatment with either type of therapy in patients with metastatic anti-estrogen-resistant ER+ breast cancer.    ,NCT02188745

Breast Cancer,Eribulin Plus Gemcitabine (EG) vs Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine (PG) in HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer, Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable disease and is needed to improve effective chemotherapy. Paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine (PG) combination chemotherapy is one of the preferred chemotherapeutic regimens for patients with MBC and was found to be proper as a maintenance chemotherapy regimen with survival benefit and feasible toxicity profile as shown in a large phase III KCSG (Korean Cancer Study Group) study (Park Y et al. J Clin Oncol 31(14):1732 2013). Eribulin mesylate is a microtubule-targeting agent that showed improved overall survival benefit as monotherapy for MBC patients as a new chemotherapeutic agent after failure of anthracycline and taxane in EMBRACE study (Cortes J et. al. Lancet 377:914-923 2011). Eribulin was also reported its promising efficacy in another randomized phase III study that demonstrated eribulin as efficacious as capecitabine (Kaufman P et. al. Abstr# S6-6 SABCS 2012). Both study results showed potential clinical benefit in patients with triple negative MBC (TNBC). Thus eribulin combined with gemcitabine may be a new potential regimen for early line therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Furthermore eribulin may have rational benefit compared with paclitaxel in terms of neurotoxicity. Although there is no direct evidence that eribulin has better neurotoxicity profile than taxane eribulin tended to show less neurotoxicity compared with ixabepilone in a phase II trial (Vahdat L et al. 2011 SABCS). Eribulin has no worsen toxicity as compared to paclitaxel. Therefore EG may have less neurotoxicity comparing to PG. In phase I trial eribulin in combination with gemcitabine was feasible in patients with advanced solid tumor treated with chemotherapy (< 3 lines) (Goel R et al 2009 ASCO). Based on this rationale the investigators are to conduct randomized phase II study comparing EG chemotherapy with PG chemotherapy for patients with HER-2 negative MBC as first-line chemotherapy. A total of 112 patients will be recruited. Patients will be randomized to a treatment arm by permutated method. The randomization ratio is 1:1. This study is multi-center randomized open label study.    ,NCT02263495
Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Medical Treatments in MBC Patients According Biological Subtype and Line of Treatments," Breast cancer is the most common cancer in many countries: in Italy about 48.000 new breast cancers are diagnosed every year and despite improvements in diagnosis and therapy about 13.000 women die every year for this disease . About 6-7% of breast cancer patients are metastatic at diagnosis  while the majority of patients with stage IV has a previous history of breast cancer that has already been treated. According to various prognostic factors (tumor size lymph nodes involvement grading hormone receptors status HER-2 status) in the worst-case scenario more than 30% of node-negative breast cancer patients and more than 70% of node-positive patients relapse2. The evolution of metastatic breast cancer has changed considerably in the last years with the approval of new drugs. In fact already in 2003 Giordano et al showed that the prognosis of metastatic breast cancer patients was improved significantly from 1970's to 2000 with a median survival of 15 months in the early 1970's compared with 60 months in the last 1990's. This significant survival gain was obtained with introduction of new drugs as hormonal chemotherapeutic and biological agents. The greater availability of drugs has led to an increase in number of lines of treatment receiving by metastatic breast cancer patients. However there are few published data on actual duration of metastatic breast cancer treatments. Moreover there is no evidence to support a real impact on survival of treatments beyond the second-third line. Recently a retrospective analysis of about 199 metastatic breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy showed that tumor subtype is associated with the duration and number of lines of chemotherapy (for example HER positive versus ""triple-negative"" patients) .

Breast Cancer,Praegnant Breast Cancer, Among patients with breast cancer the subgroup of patients with metastases are considered the group of patients with the worst prognosis. Not only with regard to therapy decisions but also with regard to quality assured healthcare and health economics this entity of patients remains a challenge. Recently novel advances in breast cancer therapy aim at the targeted therapy of tumor entities and identification of patients for whom the greatest therapy benefit and the least side effects are expected. However molecular assessment of the patient and the tumor in the metastatic situation is not performed on a routine basis and in many cases tumor characteristics from the primary tumor are considered reliable enough to make therapy decisions for the metastatic patients. Although molecular reassessment of tumor characteristics from tumor material of the metastasis is recommended in national guidelines only a minority of patients is biopsied because of the invasiveness of the procedure even though biopsy related complications are reported to be rare. With modern analytic methods from blood based biomaterial there seems to be an opportunity to correlate blood based tumor assessments with actual characteristics of the tumor. These include expression analysis tumor mutation analysis tumor gene copy number abberations and others. One of the main aims of the PRAEGNANT study is therefore to establish an infrastructure for the comprehensive analysis of tumor and metastatic molecular characteristics of the patient and the tumor. Furthermore the impact of health care related outcomes such as health economics novel approaches for integration of patients in study conduct and health care awareness are study aims of the PRAEGNANT study.    ,NCT02338167

Breast Cancer,Observation of Medical Treatments in MBC HER2-negative Patients, While therapeutic strategies for HER2-positive breast cancer are well defined there is not a standard strategy for HER2-negative tumors. Because of lack of information related to the the factors affecting the choice of a particular treatment strategy as well as the optimization of the correct sequence of treatments the choice of the treatment for the advanced disease remains highly empirical and may differ significantly among the different cancer centers. The purpose of this study is the observation of a cohort of patients with metastatic HER2-negative in terms of:   1. the choice of chemotherapy treatments starting from the first line of treatment;   2. factors that may influence these choices;   3. correlation among the characteristics of patients (age menopausal status etc.) and type of adjuvant and metastatic treatment ;   4. clinical outcome (pattern of relapse time from diagnosis etc.);   5. evaluation of the adherence to the literature's recommendations for therapeutic sequences in clinical practice.    ,NCT02365831
Breast Cancer,A Double-blind Study of Paclitaxel in Combination With Reparixin or Placebo for Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer, Reparixin oral tablets are being tested as a CSC targeting agent in patients with metastatic non- human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-amplified BC. An open label Phase 1b clinical study (REP0111) is ongoing (enrollment completed) in five US sites under IND # 112502 to test safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and detect early signs of antitumor activity of increasing doses of reparixin oral tablets in combination with a fixed dose of weekly paclitaxel. The study has demonstrated safety and tolerability of the combination across the three dose levels explored and recorded objective responses in the published range for single agent weekly paclitaxel in the target population. The highest dose level explored (i.e. 1200 mg t.i.d.) was identified as the recommended phase 2 dose. Durable responses have been recorded in patients with TNBC. The current phase 2 study thus aims to evaluate the Progression Free Survival of patients with metastatic TNBC [relapsed following (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy] receiving reparixin in combination with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone.    ,NCT02370238
Breast Cancer,Fulvestrant as Maintenance Therapy After First-line Chemotherapy in HER2 - Postmenopausal MBC Patients, Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women and represents 20 - 25% of all female cancers. Despite earlier diagnosis and improvement in adjuvant therapies some patients will present metastatic recurrence. Treatment of breast cancer is determined by the extent of the disease. Early or localized breast cancer is treated by a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. Adjuvant systemic therapy consisting of chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy in tumors deemed hormone responsive can prolong the disease-free interval and improve overall survival. However approximately 30% to 40% of patients with early breast cancer will ultimately relapse with either local recurrence or distant metastases and require further systemic treatment for advanced disease. Since breast cancer that recurs or progresses after initial treatment is considered incurable the therapy options available for advanced disease are concerned with disease control and palliation of symptoms. Hormonal therapy has become the treatment of choice in postmenopausal women with hormone sensitive breast cancer. Even though the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women has improved with the introduction of agents such as aromatase inhibitors these agents still have limitations and disease management continues to be sub-optimal. The use of systemic therapies such as hormonal therapy chemotherapy or new biological treatment is to reduce tumour masses improve survival and preserve quality of life. Whatever the initial efficacy of the treatment undertaken in metastatic setting almost every patient will relapse. The main goal is to improve progression free survival (PFS). To achieve this the type of chemotherapy the optimal duration of chemotherapy the benefit of maintenance chemotherapy the benefit of maintenance hormonal treatment are debatable.    ,NCT02383030

Breast Cancer,A Pilot Dose Escalation Trial of a Densified Chemotherapy Association of Docetaxel and Epirubicin Driven by Mathematical Modeling in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients: The MODEL1 Study, To determine the maximum tolerated dose of a densified regimen of the association of docetaxel (DTX) and epirubicin (EPI) supported by the concomitant administration of hematopoietic growth factors in patients with metastatic breast cancer in first-line optimizing in each patient the administration schedule using a formal procedure based on mathematical models in order to manage the severity of induced neutropenia. The models used in this project allow:   -  an optimal administration schedule of the planned total dose per cycle (number of infusions and calculating their rates and durations)   -  an individualization of the administration schedule from the second cycle (based on observations from the first cycle) and   -  an assessment of the risk of a dose-limiting toxicity event combining several severe non-hematological toxicities (conditioning the decision for dose escalation). Using formal mathematical models the investigators expect controlling the hematological and non-hematological toxicities in order to realize the full series of six cycles of densified DTX+EPI chemotherapy (2 weeks per cycle) for each patient. For each patient chemotherapy is considered feasible if it is possible in the absence of tumor progression to consider 6 cycles of treatment without observing any serious adverse events and without:   -  patient death that may be related to the treatments;   -  decision of the patient to interrupt treatment for physical or psychological tolerance reasons;   -  decision of the investigator to discontinue treatment in the absence of disease progression.    ,NCT02392845

Breast Cancer,Prospective Evaluation Of High-Dose Systemic Methotrexate In Patients With Breast Cancer And Leptomeningeal Metastasis, Management of leptomeningeal disease (LMD) in patients with metastatic breast cancer is an area of unmet clinical need. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is known to have activity against breast cancer and in contrast to other systemic chemotherapeutics it penetrates the blood brain barrier targets areas of poor cerebrospinal fluid flow may penetrate bulky leptomeningeal disease and provide treatment to systemic disease burden. While two retrospective studies have suggested activity of HD-MTX in LMD in patients with breast cancer no prospective data are available to inform its inclusion in treatment regimens. Thus while HD-MTX is included in the NCCN Guidelines for LMD and while it is used to varying degrees in cancer centers across the nation this is more representative of the lack of available therapies for LMD as opposed to strong evidence-based data. This phase II prospective study will evaluate systemic intravenous HD-MTX in breast cancer patients with leptomeningeal metastasis with or without brain parenchymal metastasis.    ,NCT02422641
Breast Cancer,PAKT: AZD5363 in Combination With Paclitaxel in Triple-Negative Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer, Normally cells in human body divide in an orderly way. However in cancer cells some important proteins which help control cell growth start to behave abnormally resulting in faster growth and multiplication. In this study we are looking at a protein called AKT that helps the cancer cells to develop. Blocking the action of AKT with a drug like AZD5363 may slow down or stop the cancer growing. The development of AZD5363 is intended to provide a new treatment option for patients with cancer. The standard chemotherapy agent Paclitaxel is given to destroy cancer cells. AZD5363 may also make the cancer more sensitive to Paclitaxel and so make this agent more effective. A gene called PIK3CA has an important relationship with AKT. In tumours where this gene has been altered or said to have 'mutated' the response to AZD5363 may be better. PIK3CA mutations are found commonly in breast cancers and we will test for the presence of these mutations in both blood and tumour tissue samples that we ask you to provide. This study will also look at the relationship between tumours with PIK3CA mutations and the effect of the treatment.    ,NCT02423603

Breast Cancer,SOLTI Breast Cancer Molecular Screening Program (AGATA), In recent years the advance in high-throughput techniques such as microarrays and next gen sequencing (NGS) technologies have allowed a more precise classification of the breast cancer molecular subtypes and a more personalized approach to anti-cancer therapy. To date conventional methods to select patients for clinical trials with anti-targeted agents according to molecular criteria are generally limited to the analysis of a few biomarkers. Recent studies have shown how this strategy is inappropriate in case of infrequent molecular alterations and that the ideal strategy would consist in simultaneous examination of large numbers of actionable genomic alterations. This is the first genomic screening platform ever attempted in Spain. By this molecular platform SOLTI aims to increase the likelihood of a patient being included in a trial designed specifically for her molecular tumor type. Thus the primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the Platform's effectiveness to include patients in clinical trials with targeted agents based on the tumor molecular profiling.    ,NCT02445482

Breast Cancer,A Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Poziotinib as Salvage Treatment in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Has HER2 or EGFR Mutation or Activated AR or EGFR Pathway, Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable disease and is needed to improve effective therapeutic strategies including targeted agents. Poziotinib is a panHER tyrosin kinase inhibitor (TKI) that showed stable activity with feasible toxicity for MBC patients as a salvage treatment strategy after failure of anthracycline and taxane in phase I trial. Poziotinib has rational benefit compared with other salvage agents especially for patients with HER2 overexpression breast cancers. Additionally a recent report showed that possible rational background for patients with HER2 mutation-positive breast cancers. Based on this rationale the investigators are to conduct phase II single-arm study of poziotinib for patients with MBC who showed refractoriness to conventional treatments as salvage treatment.    ,NCT02544997

Breast Cancer,Treatment of Brain Metastases From Breast Cancer With Eribulin Mesylate, Subjects are asked to take part in a clinical research study that tests Eribulin a new drug. Eribulin is an investigational (experimental) anti-cancer agent that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with brain metastases. Eribulin is FDA approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer but the effect it may or may not have on brain metastases has not been studied.    ,NCT02581839
Breast Cancer,A Study of Palbociclib With Exemestane Plus GnRH Versus Capecitabine in Premenopausal Women With HR+ MBC, Despite recent advances for the treatment of post-menopausal hormone receptor-positive BC in the last decade there was no major improvement of hormonal therapy specifically for premenopausal metastatic breast cancer. The median age of breast cancer is much younger and the proportion of young breast cancer (YBC) patients (less than 40) including premenopausal women is much higher in Asia including Korea. Capecitabine the comparator in this trial is an orally-administered fluoropyrimidine derivative and has shown high efficacy and low toxicity in metastatic breast cancer patients. Palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy showed marked advance in hormone receptor-positive MBC in the post-menopausal setting. After a median follow-up of 16.5 months preliminary results from Part 1 of this Phase 2 trial suggest that the combination of PD-0332991 with letrozole is superior to letrozole alone and improved objective response and disease control rates (52% vs 32% and 76% vs 47% respectively) in patients treated with the combination. These remarkable results may contribute to have much benefit with endocrine therapy for premenopausal women. Most importantly recent PALOMA-3 trial revealed superior results of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant (median PFS 9.2 vs 3.8 months P<0.001). Based on these rational backgrounds the purpose of this phase II study is to assess the safety and the clinical anti-tumor activity of exemestane plus goserelin acetate in combination with palbociclib vs capecitabine in premenopausal hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer patients    ,NCT02592746

Breast Cancer,Characterization & Comparison of Drugable Mutations in Primary and Metastatic Tumors CTCs and cfDNA in MBCpatients, Characterization of the driver mutations in an individual metastatic breast cancer patient is critical for many reasons. Effective targeted therapies require identifying genomic alterations in the tumoral tissue. The scarce efficacy of many currently available targeted drugs may be due to the outbreak of resistant clones with different genotype that already present at the initiation of therapy. It is well known the intra-tumor heterogeneity with genetic and non-genetic factors considered as the origin of the tumor cell-clon composition. The acquisition of multiple mutations (driver and passenger) altogether with the stage of differentiation according to the cancer stem cell hypothesis confers to the tumor cells clinically important properties such as resistance to therapies and seeding abilities. Moreover there is a current challenge in establishing whether the metastatic cells arise from the most aggressive and dominant clone in the primary tumor or the metastasic tissue diverges with substantial genetic changes very early in the evolution of the disease. Primary and metastatic tumor may have a close clonal relationship or evolve in parallel and acquire different genomic alterations. In the real life it is plausible that both models coexist with different predominance according to the tumoral tissue and etiology. The study hypothesizes that breast cancer metastases and primary tumors could harbor different genomic profiles related to genomic regions of interest in a clinically relevant proportion of metastatic breast cancer patients. Moreover the genomic aberrations found in the metastatic breast cancer tissue could also be detected in CTCs and circulating free DNA. If true CTCs and circulating free DNA would be convenient non-invasive easily accessible sources of genomic material for the analysis of mutations and other genomic aberrations.    ,NCT02626039
Breast Cancer,Study of Efficacy of Ribociclib After Progression on CDK4/6 Inhibition in Patients With HR+ H2N- Advanced Breast Cancer, This is a randomize trial for patients with metastatic HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer who have progressed on an aromatase inhibitor plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor (either palbociclib or ribociclib) to either fulvestrant alone or fulvestrant with ribociclib. The purpose of the trial is to determine whether there is continued benefit for patients to remain on a CDK4/6 inhibitor at the time of switching anti-estrogen therapy. As ribociclib and palbociclib have a similar toxicity and drug profile and mechanism of action we feel that it is appropriate for patients to receive either drug with an aromatase inhibitor prior to randomization.    ,NCT02632045

Breast Cancer,Therapy Management With Nab-Paclitaxel in Daily Routine, Despite treatment improvements in breast cancer a large number of patients still progress to the metastatic stage. Metastatic breast cancer patients have an extremely unfavorable prognosis. Not only efficacy but also quality of life are in the focus when planning a therapy or therapy sequence for metastatic breast cancer patients. Therapy options include anti-hormonal Therapy antibody therapies other targeted therapies and chemotherapies. One of the most effective chemotherapies in the adjuadjuvant and metastatic setting is paclitaxel. However drug handling and its side effects can compromise patients quality of life and can have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of the drug. In metastatic breast cancer patients increasing therapy efficacy and reduction of side effect frequency are considered to be advancements of therapy. One of these advancements is the development of a cremophor free and albumin bound paclitaxel nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane) which is thought to have a better efficacy and reduced toxicity profile. Nab-Paclitaxel is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer after a failure of first-line therapy and when antracyclines are not indicated. The SERAPHINA study aims to investigate in the use of nab-Paclitaxel in daily routine and the frequency and perception of side effects. As a non-interventional study the SERAPHINA Study will assess the patient characteristics and describe the patient cohort in which nab-Paclitaxel is given. This includes age distribution molecular epidemiological characteristics and characteristics documented by the patients themselves.    ,NCT02642406

Breast Cancer,Dose Escalating Study of Foxy-5 in Breast- Colon- or Prostate Cancer Patients, The Wnt proteins belong to a family of proteins that have been demonstrated to play a role in the formation and dissemination of tumours. The present project focuses on the critical role of the Wnt-5a protein in the pathobiological processes that lead to metastatic cancer disease. WntResearch has identified a formylated 6 amino acid peptide fragment named Foxy-5 which mimick the effects of Wnt-5a to impair migration of epithelial cancer cells and thereby acting anti-metastatic. The aim of the first clinical phase I study was to establish the recommended dose for a clinical phase II study and enable further development of Foxy-5 as a first in class anti-metastatic cancer drug. The study did not see any DLTs and therefore failed to reach maximum tolerated dose (MTD); no recommended phase II dose (RP2D) could therefore be established based on toxicity. The aim of this study is to continue to establish the safety profile of Foxy-5 in higher doses and determine the RP2D for later stage development based on any observed DLT's/MTD and further analysis of the pharmacodynamic profile of Foxy-5 to determine the biological response dose (BRD).    ,NCT02655952

Breast Cancer,Physical Activity to Maintain Quality of Life and Physical Function in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer: a Pilot Study, Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable disease. Maintaining optimum quality of life is a major goal of care. There is a strong body of evidence that exercise can reduce or manage fatigue depression and insomnia in breast cancer patients; however the evidence base is overwhelmingly in early stage cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to see if a home-based self-directed walking program can have similar benefits in women with an MBC diagnosis. The primary objective is to evaluate whether engagement in physical activity will reduce fatigue during active treatment for MBC (baseline to 3 months); this is the primary endpoint. Secondary objectives pertain to feasibility of recruitment and retention of study participants and measuring changes between baseline 3 months and 6 months in additional quality of life measures. Exploratory analyses pertain to changes in p16INK4a levels and sarcopenia between baseline and 3 months. The design is a single arm intervention trial in 30 patients. Findings from this study will provide preliminary data for a grant application to test the physical activity intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a large sample of women with metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT02682836

Breast Cancer,PAINTER: Polymorphism And INcidence of Toxicity in ERibulin Treatment, On March 17th 2011 the European Commission issued a marketing authorization valid throughout the European Union for Eribulin mesylate (Halaven; Eisai Limited) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after at least two chemotherapic regimens for advanced disease. As the use of Eribulin will be widespread in this tumor setting a better knowledge of its safety profile outside clinical trials is warranted. Indeed the possibility to select patients at risk for developing Eribulin-induced neuropathy will allow the exclusion from these treatment of those patients harbouring the specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Given that Eribulin toxicity often results in treatment discontinuation the ability to anticipate which patients will experience severe toxicity could allow for either early intervention or even possibly for prophylactic therapy or for selection of the patients to be treated.    ,NCT02864030

Breast Cancer,18F-FLT-PET Imaging of the Brain in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer to the Brain Treated With Whole Brain Radiation Therapy With or Without Sorafenib: Comparison With MR Imaging of the Brain," The purpose of this study is to compare two different imaging methods to examine the response of brain metastases to WBRT. These two imaging methods will take pictures of the brain using : 1) a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner and 2) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. A PET scanner resembles a CT or MR scanner.PET scans use radioactive substances also called as radioactive markers to ""see"" cancer cells. We plan to use [18F]FLT as a radioactive marker. FLT is used to image tumor growth. FLT PET scan is a new clinical procedure. It is in the testing stage of development unlike FDG-PET which is used more commonly used. Therefore this is considered a ""research"" study. This will help us evaluate whether this scan will be safe and better used in the future to evaluate tumors. The amount of radiation to the body is small. The radiation from the radiotracer drug will be gone from the body in a few hours. There is no radiation risk from the MRI scans. Additionally we also plan to use MRI imaging of the brain. We expect that [18F]FLT PET is better when compared to MRI and will give us more information about the brain metastases after WBRT.

Breast Cancer,Suppression of Bone Turnover Following Treatment With Zoledronic Acid in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer: Duration of Effect, Bone is the most common site of spread of breast cancer and bone metastases will occur in roughly 70% of women with advanced disease. These patients are at risk of developing bone complications that cause significant impact on both patient morbidity and mortality. Close to two-thirds of women with bone metastases will go on to develop at least one of these complications termed a skeletal related event (SRE) defined as 1) pathological fractures 2) pain requiring radiation or surgical intervention 3)spinal cord compression and 4) hypercalcemia. In addition to SREs most breast cancer patients with bone metastases have some degree of pain associated with their disease. Understandably these factors negatively impact their quality of life. Furthermore the development of an SRE in this population has been shown to be associated with shorter overall survival. Prevention or delay in onset of these complications is therefore an important therapeutic goal.    ,NCT01344967

After determining the optimal dose patients will continue treatment with cabazitaxel and lapatinib to assess response to treatment with these agents.    ,NCT01934894
Breast Cancer,Schedules of Nab-Paclitaxel in Metastatic Breast Cancer, Longer first line chemotherapy duration has recently been associated with a modest but significant improvement in overall survival and a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer patients. Prolonging chemotherapy until disease progression however must be weighed against the detrimental effects of continuous chemotherapy delivery. The SNAP trial seeks to improve the tolerability of prolonged chemotherapy administration strategy by studying alternative treatment schedules while preserving and possibly improving treatment efficacy in this disease setting. The availability of a new nanoparticle albumin-bound taxane nab-Paclitaxel (AbraxaneÂ®) represents an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Nab-Paclitaxel has been developed in an attempt to reduce the toxicity associated with standard taxane administration (caused by the use of chemical solvents) while increasing antitumor efficacy. The SNAP randomized phase II trial evaluates three schedules of nab-Paclitaxel as prolonged chemotherapy administration strategy. Each of three arms will be compared to a historical reference of seven-month median progression-free survival (PFS) based on the most recent trial with docetaxel as control arm to determine whether any of the three arms are worthy of further investigation.    ,NCT01746225

Study Design: Multicentric Open-label not randomized trial. Description of Study Treatment: Daily oral administration of DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone) at the dosage of 100 mg/die in combination with a daily oral administration of anastrozole at dosage of 1 mg/die or letrozole at the dosage of 2.5 mg/die or exemestane at the dosage of 25 mg/die without interruption until discontinuation for progression of disease unacceptable toxicity or discontinuation/withdrawal of participants from study treatment. Number of Subjects: 12 patients per group in the first step; if the number of responders is greater or equal to 2 recruitment will continue up to a total of 35 patients (per group). For the biological part we will evaluate:   1. Correlation between AR expression and clinical and biological features (tumor size nodal status histotype grading proliferative index ER PgR HER2)   2. Evaluation of AR expression on primitive and/or metastatic site in the two distinct populations of patients: ER/PgR- negative/ARpositive and ER-positive and/or PgR-positive/AR-positive   3. Evaluation of ER PgR HER2 expression on tumor cells of metastatic site (when it is possible) and comparison with the same features of primitive tumor.   4.

Breast Cancer,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Whole Body Including Diffusion in the Medical Evaluation of Breast Cancers at High Risk for Metastasis and the Follow-up of Metastatic Cancers, Whole-body MRI including diffusion is a booming technique. Numerous studies have demonstrated its interest in metastatic cancers. Breast cancers especially hormone-sensitive ones are very osteophilic and bones are the most frequent metastatic site. Apart from morphological criteria (lesion size and RECIST criteria) MRI provides quantitative functional criteria (diffusion and ADC values). According to a recent study whole body MRI is as good as PET/CT and more effective than bone scintigraphy for the diagnosis of bone metastases for cancers of breast and prostate with a high metastatic risk. Therefore it seems appropriate to study the performance of whole body MRI in the pre-therapeutic assessment of breast cancer with a high risk for metastasis and the monitoring of metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT02966574
Breast Cancer,Effect of a Mentor-based Supportive-expressive Program on Survival in Metastatic Breast Cancer," Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women and annually accounts for 10% of new malignancies worldwide. In mainland China approximately 169000 females are diagnosed with breast cancer every year and constitute 12.25% of the breast cancer incidents worldwide. Additionally 30% of early breast cancer turns metastatic which is often incurable. Different from women with early breast cancer women with metastatic breast cancer(MBC)must receive lifelong treatment experience higher levels of emotional/physical distress and feel frequent uncertainty about their health/possible death. They are also challenged to manage distressing adverse effects induced by different adjuvant treatments and experience heavy self-care demands during the transition period from being a patient to being a survivor. Thus specific interventions to help women with metastatic breast cancer to recover from this traumatic event have been designed and one of these is supportive-expressive group therapy(SEGT).SEGT has been found to achieve improvement in anxiety depression quality of life (QoL) family functioning and satisfaction with treatment. However the effect of SEGT on survival is inconsistent. Initial studies examining SEGT have reported a mean survival advantage of 18 months however these findings could not later be replicated.Yet no study has reported a survival disadvantage for those given SEGT. In addition we found no published articles on the application of SEGT among women with MBC in China. Owing to this dearth of previous research it is unclear whether this therapy would exhibit positive effects within Chinese culture. Thus we developed a ""Be Resilient to Breast Cancer""(BRBC) program that is culturally tailored for Chinese females with MBC. This program was adapted from SEGT and is designed to increase resilience(defined as the capacity to bounce back after encountering a traumatic event) and QoL decrease emotional and physical distress(allostatic load) and eventually prolong longevity. To better adapt to Chinese culture we added education hosted by professional staff (e.g. clinical psychologists dietician Chinese medicine practitioner etc.)in an effort to foster self-efficacy to combat symptoms (such as pain fatigue intrusive thoughts etc.) through knowledge and technics (such as breath control meditation etc.)and to help patients gain a sense of control in their life. Second trained mentors who were breast cancer survivors themselves were added to the group discussion to create non-hierarchical reciprocal relationships through the sharing of experiences with those facing similar challenges. These mentors also provided women with first-hand information about treatment and offered suggestions to combat barriers to recovery.    ",NCT03026374

Breast Cancer,Gemcitabine Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in the Treatment of Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer After Prior Trastuzumab/Pertuzumab or Pertuzumab Based Therapy, The purpose of this study is to see if a combination of drugs can help to treat breast cancer. This is a Phase II study which will test whether this combination of drugs is effective and will provide further information on side effects and safety. A standard chemotherapy gemcitabine will be combined with 2 other drugs that target the HER2 receptor. The HER2 receptor is a growth protein on the surface of some breast cancer cells that provides messages telling the breast cancer cell to grow. The standard chemotherapy will be gemcitabine.. The other two drugs work against HER2. One is called trastuzumab (Herceptin) and it is commonly given to women with advanced and early HER2 positive breast cancer. The other drug pertuzumab (Perjeta) is also given to women with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer. The drugs in this study are each individually approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. However this study is looking at the effectiveness of gemcitabine with trastuzumab and pertuzumab when given to women who have advanced HER2 positive breast cancer who have had prior trastuzumab + pertuzumab or pertuzumab-based therapy.    ,NCT02252887

Breast Cancer,Support and Rehabilitation Protocol for Non Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients in Complete Remission After Chemotherapy, Many breast cancer patients (BCP) will gain weight during chemotherapy and about 10% of them are able to find back to their initial weight after all treatments are finished. Other studies have shown that overweight at diagnosis was associated to a twice higher risk of relapse while a weight gain during treatments increased by 30% to 50% the risk of relapse. In western countries 75% of BCP have insufficient physical activity. Dietary and activity programs seem to be able to significantly reduce the mortality risk after breast cancer. The investigators performed a prospective randomized trial consisting in dietary counseling physical training and physiotherapy in hydrothermal centers. Intervention were delivered in small group session lasting 12 days. SPA cares were offered to patients. Patients in the control group also received dietary counseling given by a dietetician inside anticancer hospital and were asked to perform more physical activities. Main endpoints of the trial addressed quality of life (SF36) one year after inclusion weight reduction anxiety/depression (HAD) sleep quality and long term compliance to instructions.

Breast Cancer,Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Role of Exercise in Women Undergoing Treatment for Breast Cancer, TITLE: Randomized Controlled Evaluating the Role of Exercise in Women Undergoing Treatment for Breast Cancer Yoga and Quality of life: Yoga is based on the practice of physical postures breathing techniques and meditation. Philosophically it aims at increasing the body's ability to master the mind with the goal of spiritual awareness and connection. A randomized trial of yoga in women with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy demonstrated an improvement in impact of events scale at 3 months suggesting that the more intrusive thoughts at 1 month the greater the finding of meaning in cancer by 3 months. Randomized studies have demonstrated evidence of yoga improving the emotional well being of women with breast cancer and improving their distressed mood thus providing a buffering effect on QOL. The main beneficial effects demonstrated are on social functioning. Among patients not receiving chemotherapy yoga appears to enhance emotional well-being and mood and may serve to buffer deterioration in both overall and specific domains of QOL. EVALUATION TOOLS- European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 & BR-23) Brief Fatigue Inventory VAS (Pain score) Spirituality Questionnaire Pulmonary function test Objective assessment STUDY ENDPOINTS- Primary end points- Disease free survival Secondary end points- Quality of life & Improvements in overall survival STUDY DESIGN TREATMENT PLAN - All newly diagnosed cases with stage I-III of breast cancer who present to Tata Memorial Hospital will be randomly assigned to perform either a set of 'Yogic and Routine Exercises (referred to as exercise I) or Routine Exercises'(referred to as exercise II)./ Patients will begin the exercises within a week of starting treatment. Both arms of the study will receive a training session one hour per day for the first week during which they will be instructed to practice daily and maintain a daily log. The other evaluation tools will be used as per the assessment time line (enclosed).The exercises in the Exercise I arm (Yoga and conventional exercises) will be upgraded within the next 2 days to Phase II. Patients will be allowed to attend a minimum of four out of seven days in Phase I and II. Patients will be assessed at 6 months for compliance to phase II exercises. Only if patients are fulfilling the criteria for accuracy sequence and duration of phase II exercises will they be taught phase III exercises. Patients who are unable to do phase II exercises at 6 months will be re taught phase II exercises. These patients will then be re assessed at 1 year for up gradation to phase III. Six months after completion of phase III exercises patients will be assessed for compliance to phase III exercises. Patients will also undergo an objective assessment at 1 year. An additional up gradation will be after completion of adjuvant therapy at 6 months. Patients will be followed up for a period of 5 years. DFS will be measured from the time of randomization to either progression or death. Quality of life will be measured at baseline and every six monthly using the functional assessment cancer therapy- quality of life. Quality of Life analysis at 400 patients will be performed with appropriate correction for multiple analyses applied. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS- For an expected 50% 5 year disease free survival (DFS) for the control group the expected 5 years DFS for the intervention group will be 60%. With a two-sided analysis and at 80% power and 95% confidence to detect a 10% difference between the arms the sample size would be 761 patients. Assuming a 10% loss to follow up a total of 850 patients would be accrued. We expect to complete accrual in 3 year. RANDOMIZATION AND STRATIFICATION- Randomization for intervention will be done centrally from Clinical Research Secretariat and patient will be stratified by Menopausal status: Pre + Peri or Post Neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment Stage of disease: I/II/III ANALYSIS- Disease Free Survival (DFS) will be calculated from the date of randomization to the date of local regional or distant relapse or death from any cause and will be censored at the last date of follow up for the patients that are alive and disease free or have been lost to follow up. Overall Survival (OS) will be calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death or censored at the date of last follow up for the patients who are alive or lost to follow up. DFS and OS will be evaluated using Kaplan Meier and compared by Log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazard model will be used to assess the impact of intervention after correction for stratification menopausal status and age.    ,NCT02161900

Breast Cancer,Impact of a Telephonic Monitoring During Inter-treatment Intervals on Emotional State Quality of Life and Toxicities on Neo Adjuvant or Adjuvant Chemotherapy-treated Patients, In health care the phone has emerged as a clinical tool in its own right especially for the development of psychological support to patients and that in many pathologies. Its potential in the development of psycho-social support was quickly identified. However to our knowledge no prospective randomized studies have evaluated the impact of a telephone call to both the anxiety and the management of side effects of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient incomplete care by the hospital system and the general practitioner during chemotherapy as well as the lack of information and poor preparation and / or management of side effects are a source of distress and lead to a decrease quality of life for the patient and his family. We propose to determine on a population of 280 patients the impact of two phone calls during 3 first inter-treatment intervals on the overall measure of mood states of the patient and his principal caregiver (anxiety depression confusion angry fatigue force and interpersonal relation). We will also study the gain in quality of life on anxiety level frequency and severity of toxicities as well as emotional comfort of the procedure.    ,NCT01977053

Breast Cancer,Randomized Controlled Trial to Assess Blockade of Voltage Gated Sodium Channels During Surgery in Operable Breast Cancer, Voltage Gated Sodium Channels Over the years there is more evidence that ionic channels are involved in the oncogenic process. Among these voltage gated sodium channels (VGSC) expressed in non-nervous or non-muscular organs are often associated with the metastatic behavior of different cancers. Expression of VGSCs has been reported both in vitro and/or in vivo in a range of human carcinomas including breast cancer Ion channels are major signaling molecules expressed in a wide variety of tissues. They are involved in determining a variety of cellular functions like proliferation solute transport volume control enzyme activity secretion invasion gene-expression excitation-contraction coupling and intercellular communication.4 VGSC activity contributes to much cellular behavior integral to metastasis including cellular process extension lateral motility and galvanotaxis transverse invasion and secretory membrane activity. A correlation between Na transport and oncogenesis has been widely reported in literature. In 1980 transformed mouse mammary cells were shown to have 3-fold higher intra-cellular sodium content than untransformed cells.5 Additionally evidence suggest that increasing the inward sodium current through voltage gated sodium channels increased the invasive capacity of breast cancer.6 Also growth and proliferation of mammary adenocarcinoma cells can be inhibited by Amiloride suggesting that epithelial Na channels (ENaC) activity is correlated with proliferation of breast cancer cells Current evidence suggests that VGSC activity is necessary and sufficient for cancer cell invasiveness8. A recent in vitro study has shown that the human MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell line expressed functional VGSCs9. However the molecular nature of the VGSC and its functional relevance to breast cancer in vivo are currently under study. Surgical operations for cancer have been reported to induce dissemination of cancer cells into surrounding tissues or into the circulation1011and infiltration anesthetics can inhibit immune response12-14. Although the mechanism remains to be elucidated infiltration anesthetics such as lidocaine have membrane- stabilizing action (Seeman 1972) and these agents could have direct effects on cancer cells. Therefore it is important to clarify the effects of infiltration anesthetics on behavior of the tumor cells. Commonly used local anesthetic agents inhibit the VGSCs and also possess a unique membrane stabilizing action through other unknown mechanisms. A study by Mammota et al 15 reported that lignocaine effectively inhibited the invasive ability of human cancer (HT1080 HOS and RPMI-7951) cells at concentrations used in surgical operations (5-20 mM). Lidocaine reduced the invasion ability of these cells by partly inhibiting the shedding of HB-EGF from the cell surface and modulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration contributed to this action. In addition lidocaine (5-30 mM) infiltrated around the inoculation site inhibited pulmonary metastases of murine osteosarcoma (LM 8) cells in vivo. Dose of lidocaine15: 40 mM (1%) lidocaine is usually used for infiltration anesthesia for surgical operations. Lower concentrations (1-20mM) of lidocaine were sufficient to suppress the invasive ability of cancer cells14. One mM lidocaine inhibited the invasive ability of HT1080 cells by about 50% and 20 mM lidocaine inhibited the invasion ability completely. Lidocaine also inhibited dose-dependently the invasive ability of HOS and RPMI-7951 cells although it was less effective on HOS cells. Lignocaine exerts its anesthetic action by obstructing the sodium channel 16 however 10 mMof tetrodotoxin (TTX) a specific sodium channel inhibitor had little effect on the invasive ability of HT1080 cells. Ten mM lidocaine-N-ethylbromide (NEB) which does not cross the cell membrane also had little effect on the invasive ability of the cells. Objectives Primary Objective: ??To assess the in-vivo ability of local anesthetics agents like lignocaine to decrease the dissemination of cancer cells during surgery and improve the disease free interval Secondary Objective ??To assess the in-vivo ability of local anesthetics agents like lignocaine on impacting long term survival. Methodology / Treatment plan The study drug (0.5% lidocaine 60mM) will be tested in the intraoperative setting prior to surgery will be tested in a randomized setting.: Arm A: 60mM of 0.5% lignocaine will be injected peritumoral prior to excision. The local anesthetic should be injected on all 6 surfaces of the tumor and also within the tumor. Wait for 7 minutes for its action followed by surgery. (Intervention arm) Arm B: No injection of lignocaine prior to excision (Control arm)    ,NCT01916317

Breast Cancer,Assessment of the Mutation of Pig-A Gene as Biomarker of Genotoxic Exposure in Humans, The evaluation of the impact of environment on the incidence of cancer is a major public health issue. Increased knowledge in this area is necessary for the implementation of primary prevention means with appropriate preventive measures but also to the implementation of secondary prevention measures with targeted screening actions. Among the environmental exposures that may lead to cancer mutagenic environments are of major importance and the causal link between environmental genotoxicity and cancer has been established for a long time. It is also well established that susceptibility to mutation is highly variable among individuals. This is explained by genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in metabolism and in genome stability. The identification of biomarkers of exposure to mutagenic environments is necessary for assessing the impact of an environment in humans. Some studies in animals have shown that the PIG-A gene may be a biomarker of exposure to a mutagenic environment. In particular a significant increase in erythrocyte PIG-A mutants has been demonstrated in rats after a genotoxic exposure to cisplatin but it has so far not been evaluated in humans. One study of healthy volunteers shows that the frequency of PIG-A mutated cells in humans can be estimated efficiently and reliably. The PIG-A gene meets all the necessary criteria for a sentinel gene for tracking of spontaneous somatic mutation frequency or induced a mutagenic environment: ubiquitous expression phenotypic change linked to a mono-allelic mutation viability of mutated cells  spectrum off inactivating mutations (deletions substitutions chromosomal rearrangements). Finally the detection of the disappearance of glycosylphosphatidylinositol on the plasma membrane is easily achievable by flow cytometry.    ,NCT02727868

Breast Cancer,"Trial Comparing Calendula Officinalis With Aqueous Cream ""Essex"" to Treat Skin Reactions From Radiotherapy of Breast Cancer", Acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR) occur in the majority of patients undergoing postoperative radiotherapy (RT). Some patients experience more severe reactions such as dry and/or moist desquamation but most patients experience mild reactions e.g. erythema (Lopez et al. 2005). The radiation dose volume RT technique and previous treatment such as type of surgery and previous chemotherapy are factors that might impact on the risk for ARSR together with patient-related factors such as body mass index (BMI) smoking status and previous skin damage (Porock et al. 1998; Wells et al. 2004). In a pilot study (n=93) of the frequency of ARSR in patients with breast cancer who underwent adjuvant RT it was shown that 93% developed ARSR mostly mild reactions. Patients reported low scores on pain and itching (Sharp et al. 2011). Over 80% of the patients reported adherence to the skin care recommendations which included application of a thin layer of EssexÂ® cream a non-perfumed aqueous cream on the irradiated area at least two times a day (Sharp et al. 2011). The effects of skin care products containing Calendula Officinalis (marigold plant) on ARSR in patients with breast cancer were investigated in a randomized clinical trial (Pommier et al. 2004). Patients in the experimental group treated with calendula cream had a statistically significant lower incidence of severe ARSR pain and treatment interruptions in comparison with the patients in the control group treated with trolamine. The purpose of this blinded randomized clinical trial is to compare two topical agents Calendula WeledaÂ® cream and EssexÂ® cream in terms of efficacy to reduce the risk of severe acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR) in relation to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for breast cancer. Patients were instructed to apply a thin layer of the assigned cream twice a day starting at the onset of RT and continue until two weeks after termination or until the ARSR is healed. The application should include the whole treatment area including the armpit and shoulder/back area in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy. Patients are also advised to not apply the cream within two hours before the RT in order to avoid possible build-up effect. Daily wash with perfume free soap and tap water are recommended and patients are advised to refrain from use of other topical agents in the irradiated area. The primary endpoint is the efficacy to reduce acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR) assessed with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/The Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (RTOG/EORTC scale) at follow-up. Secondary endpoints include patient reported outcome measures; Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) Sleep disturbances (MOS-sleep questionnaire) and symptoms experienced from the irradiated area (visual analogue scale). Patients' experiences and adherence to the topical agents are also evaluated. A total of 400 patients are required to detect a true absolute reduction in the proportion of patients with ARSR from 35% with standard treatment (EssexÂ® cream) to 20% with the experimental treatment (Calendula WeledaÂ® cream) with a significance level of 5% a power of 90%. With this sample size 95% confidence intervals for the difference in proportions are estimated to be in the order of Â±10%. Assuming a rate of 5% of non-responders the target size has been set to 420 patients.    ,NCT01688479

Breast Cancer,Efficacy and Safety of Cabazitaxel Versus Weekly Paclitaxel as Neo-adjuvant Treatment in Patients With Triple Negative or Luminal B/HER2 Normal BC (GENEVIEVE), Cabazitaxel is a new taxoid which promotes the tubulin assembly in vitro and stabilizes microtubules against cold-induced depolymerization as efficiently as docetaxel and was selected for development based on a better antiproliferative activity on resistant cell lines than docetaxel. It has shown superior survival against mitoxantrone (MTX) plus prednisone in docetaxel pre-treated hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer patients leading to registration of the compound. It showed a favorable toxicity profile with an interestingly low rate of alopecia. In the Genevieve study it will be compared against weekly paclitaxel which is currently most widely used treatment of breast cancer patients. A head-to-head comparison in the neoadjuvant setting will allow a rapid and precise comparison of efficacy and tolerability of cabacitaxel versus paclitaxel to decide in how far further development of this taxoid in breast cancer is reasonable.    ,NCT01779479

Breast Cancer,Phase II Window of Opportunity Study of Short-term Preoperative Treatment With Enzalutamide (Alone or in Combination With Exemestane) in Patients With Primary Breast Cancer, This study is being carried out to see if the antiandrogen enzalutamide has antitumour effects in early breast cancer. Enzalutamide blocks the action of androgens on the androgen receptor (AR) and may slow down or stop breast cancers growing. Enzalutamide is approved for the treatment of prostate cancer. The trial will be offered to patients who have just been diagnosed with early breast cancer and who are planned to have surgery in the next few weeks. The treatment will bridge the time between the diagnosis and surgery and will be given for 2- 4 weeks. To assess the effect of the treatment small samples of breast cancer tissue will be analysed before the start and after treatment. The pre-treatment assessment will be done on archived tissue but patients might require an additional biopsy if sufficient stored tumour tissue is not available. The end of treatment samples will be taken during surgery unless the patient will receive medical treatment first instead of surgery which might mean additional biopsies of the breast cancer have to be taken. The trial has two cohorts. The cohort of patients with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer will test if adding enzalutamide to exemestane is better at slowing the growth of breast cancer than exemestane alone. This cohort will recruit 141 evaluable post-menopausal patients with a tumour size of at least 1 cm. The aromatase inhibitor exemestane is approved for the treatment of ER positive breast cancer. Blocking aromatase decreases oestrogens but can increase androgens. Enzalutamide is therefore added to block the action of androgens on the AR. In the second cohort of patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) enzalutamide will be given alone to see if it can slow the growth tumours with androgen receptors. As only approximately 30% of TNBCs express the AR a pre screening step will be included to test the tumour AR expression before patients are approached for the ARB trial. The TNBC cohort will comprise 55 patients.    ,NCT02676986
Breast Cancer,A Study of Zoledronic Acid in the Prevention of Cancer Therapy-induced Bone Loss, Breast cancer and osteoporosis are two of the most frequent diseases in women. Estrogen may be associated with bone loss and the risk of breast cancer because of its potent effects on the mitotic activity of breast epithelium and on bone turnover. This study is will assess the safety and efficacy of Zoledronic acid 4 mg given every 3 months over 24 months in improving bone mineral density in premenopausal women with hormone receptor negative breast cancer and adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment compared to placebo. This study is not recruiting patients in the United States.    ,NCT00333229
Breast Cancer,Safety Study of Adding Everolimus to Adjuvant Hormone Therapy in Women With High Risk of Relapse ER+ and HER2- Primary Breast Cancer Free of Disease After Receiving at Least One Year of Adjuvant Hormone Therapy, A significant number of patients relapse and eventually die particularly if they were initially diagnosed with large nodes involvement and/or T3/4 diseases. When analyses focus on patients with ER+/Her2-negative breast cancer with ??N+ 30% had relapsed at 5 years emphasizing the need for new drugs in this setting (PACS01 data UNICANCER internal data). Strong evidence suggests that cross-talk between the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and ER signaling is linked to hormone resistance in breast cancer patients. In the present study we plan to evaluate the benefit from adding everolimus to standard endocrine treatments after three years of treatment for patient ER+/HER2- at high risk of relapse due to high nodes involvement (??) and/or persistent node involvement after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Genomic signatures have emerged during the last 10 years as a new and additive means to evaluate more precisely long term prognosis and in some instances the amount of benefit from chemotherapy or endocrine therapy in the adjuvant setting. Therefore the UNIRAD study can be proposed to patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes at primary surgery and a high risk of relapse with the EndoPredict test. This study is a unique opportunity to prove the efficacy of everolimus in adjuvant setting. The study could be practice changing in case of positive results and could allow improving outcome of breast cancer patients presenting high risk of metastatic relapse.    ,NCT01805271
Breast Cancer,Perioperative Administration of COX 2 Inhibitors and Beta Blockers to Women Undergoing Breast Cancer Surgery, Surgery for breast cancer has a major role in enhancing long term survival and cure but several physiological aspects associated with surgery are implicated as enhancing tumor spread and formation of distant metastases. These include: an increase in pro-angiogenic factors direct spread of tumor cells accumulation of grown factors immune suppression and direct effects of anesthetics and opiate pain relievers on cancer cells. Some of these pro-metastatic mechanism may be blocked by the interventions proposed in this study namely by administration of beta-adrenergic blockers and COX2 inhibitors around the time of surgery. Studies have shown that surgery increases levels of catecholamines and prostaglandins which in turn may promote the release of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF and enhance vascularization of micro metastases. Opiates given for pain relief during and after surgery have been reported to enhance tumor cell division and cause immune suppression. The immune system is significantly suppressed during surgery. This suppression has been shown to affect the systemic resistance to infection as well as neoplastic metastatic processes. Several studies have shown that increased levels of catecholamines and prostaglandins add to the immune suppression. Studies in rats found that peri-operative administration of the beta beta-blocker propranolol together with the COX2 inhibitor etodolac significantly reduced the suppression of NK cell activity as well as the risk for distant metastases. A recent retrospective clinical study found that among breast cancer patients treated with a combination of regional anesthesia and a COX inhibitor the recurrence rated were significantly less than among patients undergoing surgery without these two interventions. The purpose of the proposed prospective trial is to examine if peri-operative administration of the combination of a beta-blocker together with a COX2 inhibitor will prevent suppression of cellular immunity decrease VEGF levels and decrease cancer recurrence rates. In the proposed study breast cancer patients will be treated with a combination of a beta-blocker and COX2 inhibitor (or placebo) before during and after surgery. (A control group of healthy women will serve as untreated controls). The variables which will be examined are: number and activity of NK cells levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines serum stress hormones and angiogenic factors and the ability of leukocytes to produce Th1 and Th2 cytokines as a result of in vitro stimulation. In addition to these immediate parameters long term follow up will be conducted in order to determine the effect of the intervention on long term cancer recurrence over five years. Statistical analysis will be done using t-tests ANOVA and multivariate regressions with regard to the known risk factors for recurrence such as tumor grade lymph node involvement etc. Sample size for immunological parameters will be 40 patients in each group and 20 healthy women. Sample size for estimates of cancer recurrence at five years of follow up wiil be 460 women (230 in each group). This sample size provides a power of 80% to detect a 50% reduction in cancer recurrence at an Î± of 0.05.    ,NCT00502684

Breast Cancer,Intraoperative Imagery of Breast Cancer With Folate-FITC (EC17), Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second cause of cancer mortality in women. There are approximately 200000 new cases of breast cancer a year. Classically breast cancers are divided into two groups invasive and non-invasive. A mainstay of the treatment of both of these types is surgical resection not only for therapeutic purposes but also for diagnostic purposes. Breast conserving therapy includes surgical lumpectomy and post-operative radiation. However despite best surgical practices when patients undergo BCT anywhere from 20 - 40% of these patients have margins positive for cancer. This leads to increased rates of reoperation which are quoted to be as high as 30% and increased local recurrences. There is an over expression of folate receptors located on the surface of many human carcinoma nodules.Specifically for breast cancer up to 33% of all breast cancers over express the folate receptor. Folate-fluorescein isothiocyanate or folate-FITC also identified as EC-17 targets folate receptors over expressed in certain cancers such as breast cancer and could help in better identifying the margins of the cancer thereby achieving negative margins.    ,NCT01994369

Breast Cancer,Effect of Combined Exercise Post-treatment Intervention in Lean Mass Recovery in Breast Cancer Survival.," Breast cancer survival it is affected by the side effects related to the illness the treatments or even the behavioral factors (e.g. inadequate diet sedentary behavior) that create in this women an important quantity of psychological and physical disorders. Prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrate that supervised aerobic training is a safe feasible and effective adjunct therapy to improve a broad range of physiological and psychological outcomes in women with early breast cancer. However the vast majority of studies to date have focused on the efficacy of exercise to improve symptom control outcomes in breast cancer patients either during or following the completion of adjuvant therapy. Most relevant consequences are found in women that have to undergo surgery as 16% to 43% of women with breast cancer suffer functional limitation in the shoulder inflammation pain or strength and flexibility reduction in upper body limbs one year after surgery with a high prevalence which is rising. Weight gain is associated with decreased quality of life and increased risk for several comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The most of the cardiopulmonary problems are induced by chemotherapy or radiotherapy because of the treatments effect in the heart and its consequences in cardiorespiratory fitness of these women. These side effects become in important limitations to allow women return their normal life style. These limitations have a severe effect in decreasing of physical activity practice which have visible consequences in increasing general fatigue and calcium deficiency in bones due to the age and some adjuvant treatments. Previous studies found that patients with breast cancer who gained modest amounts of weight were significantly more likely to experience disease recurrence and die from breast cancer and other causes that those who were weight stable. In addition two thirds of the studies that have assessed body composition change in relation to weight gain in this patient population observe no net gain in muscle mass or loss in muscle mass as body weight and adipose tissue increase. These changes are defined as sarcopenic obesity. This kind of obesity is characterized by weight gain in the presence of lean tissue loss or absence of lean tissue gain. In addition fat tissue gain is related with other health disorders such as diabetes functional limitations and poor survival levels. Treatment for this unique pattern of weight gain is an exercise intervention especially strength training. Psychological effects have to be took account as cancer produce important aftermath. Large scientific evidence shows the psycho-emotional alterations in women diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their life. World Health Organization (WHO) defines quality of life as ""individuals perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals expectations standards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept affected in a complex way by the person's physical health psychological state level of independence social relationships personal beliefs and their relationship to salient features of their environment."" Following this definition numbered of researches have been developed presenting interest in both physiological and psychological changes and improvements as show different studies. HYPOTHESIS The primary hypothesis of this study is that group exercise intervention combining aerobic and strength training will reduce lean mass and body fat tissue in breast cancer post treatment survival. Secondary hypothesis of this clinical trial are follows:   1. Combined exercise intervention will increase maximal strength level of chest press and leg press.   2. Combined exercise intervention will increase maximal cardiopulmonary capacity assessed by Peak Oxygen Consumption(VO2peak) which has been confirmed as an important value in survivals. In addition ACSM propose this value as the Gold Standard to assess fitness level.   3. Combined exercise intervention will increase global Isometric Strength Index assessed by Grip Strength Dynamometer.   4. Combined exercise intervention will improve range motion in upper-limbs.   5. Patients Reported Outcomes (PROs) such as quality of life (QoL) Health perception and depression.    ",NCT01843608

Breast Cancer,Partial Breast Radiation to the Lumpectomy Cavity With IMRT in Elderly Women, The standard treatment for women with invasive breast cancer is local excision follow by whole breast radiation. The local recurrence rates are low side effects are low and the cosmetic outcome is excellent. The treatments however need to be given daily for 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 weeks making the treatment difficult particularly for the elderly and for women who need to travel long distances for the therapy. The goal of this study is to determine the toxicity and efficacy of giving the radiation in a shorter time using higher daily doses of radiation. The risk of recurrence in the elderly population is lower and since majority of recurrences occur close to the area where the tumor previously was it is hypothesized that radiation to that area of the breast would be sufficient to obtain low risk of recurrence. When a smaller volume of tissue is treated more radiation can be given daily and therefore the treatment can be shortened. The risk of side effects increases as the dose per daily treatment increases. Therefore the goal is to study the short term side effects long term side effects and cosmetic outcome of daily radiation using higher daily doses for shorter period of time. We will also follow the recurrence rate. Because less of the breast tissue will be treated there may be a small increased risk of recurrence. Because the higher fraction size can result in more side effects we will be using intensity modulated radiation (IMRT). IMRT is the most advanced individually tailored radiation treatment technique that results in the least amount of side effects. It allows tight monitoring of the dose in the untreated breast. Seventy five women diagnosed with stage I breast cancer will participate. Participants must have a lumpectomy clear margins and no lymphovascular invasion to be eligible. A treatment planning CT scan will be obtained. If the lumpectomy cavity can be clearly delineated an IMRT plan will be generated with predefined strict dose requirement criteria. The patients will be treated once daily 5 days a week for a total of 10 treatments (instead of standard 28-33). The patients will be evaluated for toxicity weekly during the treatment and weekly for additional 4 weeks. At each of these evaluations they will fill out a short 10 minute questionnaire detailing their side effects. Follow-up will continue every 3 months for 3 years and every 6 months for 2 more years. At each of these follow-ups a short questionnaire will be filled out by the patients detailing any toxicity as well as their perception of the cosmetic outcome. A cosmesis questionnaire will be also be filled out by the evaluating physician before radiation at 6 12 18 and 24 months and yearly for 3 more years. A total of 5 years of follow-up is planned. Participants will also have the option of consenting to the photograph portion of the study. Those who do will have photographs taken of their breasts (excluding faces) at the time they complete the cosmetic questionnaire to evaluate the cosmetic outcome.    ,NCT00337064

Breast Cancer,Comparison of Use of Indocyanine Green and 99mTc-labeled Radiotracer for Axillary Lymphatic Mapping in Patients With Breast Cancer, This clinical trial will enroll up to 130 adult women with a confirmed diagnosis of clinical stage 1 or 2 breast cancer who are undergoing breast cancer surgery with lumpectomy or mastectomy and planned axillary sentinel node biopsy procedure. Patients will undergo lymphatic mapping with technetium Tc-99m (99mTc) sulfur colloid in accordance with routine clinical practice. Injections of 99mTc sulfur colloid will take place the afternoon prior to planned next morning surgery or on the morning of surgery. Patients will undergo lymphoscintigraphy in accordance with standard clinical practice. Immediately prior to operation after the induction of anesthesia in the operating room up to 1cc of 0.5% indocyanine green (ICG) solution will be injected subdermally close to the tumor or into the subareolar region after disinfection of the breast skin. ICG movement will be facilitated by manual massage and monitored with fluorescence imaging. ICG fluorescence will be elicited and detected by Photodynamic Eye (PDE) camera. The lymphatic drainage made evident by the fluorescent dye will be monitored in real time on a monitor. The fluorescence will be followed towards the armpit region (axilla) and time for the fluorescence to reach the axilla will be recorded. Following standard practice an incision will be made in the armpit region. Fluorescent lymph nodes (ICG positive) will be localized and removed and analyzed by a pathologist. Node removal will continue until no residual fluorescence is visible in the axilla. Removed nodes will be tested for radioactivity using a standard gamma-detecting probe and the counts per minute will be recorded. Finally the armpit region will be inspected with the gamma probe to determine if there are any residual radioactive nodes. Residual sentinel nodes (the first node to receive lymph from a tumor) will be removed. For the purposes of this study the sentinel status of a node will be defined as being flagged as sentinel by either one or both of the ICG or 99mTc methods. The goal of the project is to confirm that axillary lymphatic mapping with ICG leads to similar nodes being labeled as sentinel as lymphatic mapping with 99mTc-labeled radiotracer.    ,NCT02419807
Breast Cancer,Image-guided Breast Surgery in the Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating Suite (AMIGO), This research study is a pilot study designed to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging-guided therapy (MRT) as a possible treatment for breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,A Randomized Open-label Phase III Trial of MapisalÂ® Versus an Urea Hand-foot Cream as Prophylaxis for Capecitabine-induced Hand-foot Syndrome in Patients With Gastrointestinal Tumors or Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is the examination of MapisalÂ® versus urea hand-foot cream as prophylaxis for capecitabine-induced hand-foot syndrome (HFS) in patients with gastrointestinal tumors or breast cancer to assess the efficacy of MapisalÂ®. MapisalÂ® is a medical device that is approved for the prophylaxis and treatment of HFS. Initial clinical data and case studies on the treatment and prophylaxis of Caelyx-induced HFS have been impressive. Because the pathomechanism of HFS caused by capecitabine is the same as for Caelyx-induced HFS it is expected reason that administering MapisalÂ® should result in a significant reduction of HFS caused by capecitabine. The urea hand-foot cream was selected for the standard arm because it is used commonly is accepted by patients and seems to have a positive influence on the severity of the HFS in the experience of many oncologists.    ,NCT01626781
Breast Cancer,Predictive Model of Therapy Outcomes in Breast Cancer Patients, Patients with breast cancer who are treated with curative intent have a combination of surgery (excision of the tumor) and a course of medical therapy (chemotherapy or endocrine treatment). Both treatments are associated with significant side effects. Chemotherapy is associated with nausea vomiting hair loss and bone marrow suppression whereas endocrine therapy is associated with arthritis and menopausal symptoms. Patients taking either chemotherapy or endocrine treatment may experience a range of side effects. The range and severity of side effects experienced vary from patient to patient. Little or nothing is known about the reason for this difference. The aim of the investigators proposal is to develop a pretreatment test to identify patients who are likely to undergo moderate to severe side effects and therefore help doctors and patients plan and optimize medical therapy. The pretreatment test will be based on identifying a metabolic profile which can differentiate those patients who are likely to have severe or moderate side effects from those with either no or mild side effects. To do this the investigators will take urine and blood samples from patients before and after the administration of endocrine treatment or chemotherapy and generate metabolic profiles. Furthermore the investigators aim to gain an understanding into why side effects experienced between different patients are so variable. To do this the investigators plan to perform cytokine analysis targeted genetic analysis and pharmaokinetic analysis on blood sample collected from patients before and after treatment has commenced. Patients who have planned surgical excision of tumor and are recommended to receive medical therapy before or after surgery would be invited to join the study. Each patient will be required to make additional visits to the hospital to complete questionnaires regarding side effects experienced and for sample (urine and blood) collection. The investigators plan to recruit 168 patients.    ,NCT01563211
Breast Cancer,A Phase 2 Study of Standard Chemotherapy Plus BSI-201 (a PARP Inhibitor) in the Neoadjuvant Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer, This study will investigate whether the neoadjuvant combination of gemcitabine carboplatin and BSI-201 will cause a high percentage of triple negative breast cancer patients to achieve a pathologic complete response prior to surgery. Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.    ,NCT00813956

Breast Cancer,Comparison Study of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Chinese Triple Negative Breast Cancer, Previous studies in Western country show that triple-negative breast cancer has aggressive clinical and pathological features compared with non-triple negative breast cancer including onset at a young age advanced clinical stage high histologic and nuclear grade and more distant recurrence. According to the characteristics of triple negative breast tumor the TNBC patients can benefit neither from hormonal therapies nor from target therapies against Her2 receptors. The only systemic therapy currently available is chemotherapy and prognosis remains poor. It becomes more and more important to investigate the sensitive chemotherapy regimen for triple negative patients. Cisplatin-based regimen was active for the patients of lung cancer colorectal cancer and ect. Triple negative breast cancer patients were more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy regimens according to the results of some retrospective studies. The investigators hypothesized that paclitaxel combined with cisplatin is more sensitive to triple negative breast cancer compared with CEF followed by docetaxel.    ,NCT01216111

The safety of single-agent nab-paclitaxel has been determined in previous studies of participants with mBC and the safety data to date suggest that atezolizumab can be safely combined with standard chemotherapy agents.    ,NCT02425891
Breast Cancer,Safety and Immunogenicity of a Personalized Synthetic Long Peptide Breast Cancer Vaccine Strategy in Patients With Persistent Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, The most important consideration in the design of this clinical trial is to ensure the safe translation of the personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dictates that initial studies of biologic therapies be performed in such a way that there is a balance between the potential risks and benefits in individual patients. Consistent with these recommendations the investigators will target patients with triple-negative breast cancer who do not have a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These patients typically have no gross evidence of disease following standard of care therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy surgery and radiation therapy) but are at extremely high-risk for disease recurrence. Targeting this patient population provides a window-of-opportunity to design and manufacture the personalized cancer vaccines maximizes the potential benefit from the vaccine as the regulatory networks associated with metastatic disease are not present and balances risk in this patient population with extremely high risk for disease recurrence but no other treatment options.    ,NCT02427581
Breast Cancer,Trial of Afatinib With Paclitaxel for Neoadjuvant Therapy of TNBC and Research of Biomarkers of Afatinib, [Background]: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of both estrogen and progesterone receptor as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). TNBC is characterized by distinct molecular histological and unfavorable clinical features despite the high rates of response to chemotherapy. Based on the above reasons it is important to emergently develop novel therapies and/or treatment strategies to increase treatment efficacies and the survival rate of TNBC. [Rationale]: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) and EGFR mutation have been reported in TNBC and may therefore be a valid target for anti-tumor therapy in TNBC. Afatinib (BIBW 2992) is an ErbB-family blocker that irreversibly inhibits signaling from all relevant ErbB-family dimers. Afatinib has demonstrated preclinical activity in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines and xenograft models of breast cancer and clinical activity in phase I studies. Based on the assumption that uncontrolled ErbB-signaling is directly related to an increased oncogenic potential in TNBC the studying afatinib in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC patients is important and provides a novel therapy. [Aims] The primary endpoint is to evaluate the pathologic complete response of the combination of afatinib and weekly paclitaxel in TNBC patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment. The secondary endpoints are to evaluate the clinical response and safety of afatinib with and without paclitaxel and to explore the different afatinib-affecting downstream molecular pathways as well as potential biomarkers predicting the response of afatinib with and without paclitaxel. [Patients and methods]: Patients with TNBC (clinical T2-T3 N0-N1 M0; clinical T1-3 N1-2 M0; or any T4a tumor) and received neoadjuvant treatment will included in this open label multi-center phase II study. Our schema is as follows: (1) Afatinib 40 mg per day for 14 days then evaluation every subject will go into the following phase no matter whether she had response or not (2) the following phase (the combination with afatinib and paclitaxel): Afatinib 40 mg per day day 1 to day 21 in combination with paclitaxel 80 mg/mÂ² on days 1 8 15 in a 3-weekly course. In addition to the clinical assessment we will evaluate the potential predictive biological markers of activity of Afatinib with and without paclitaxel and dynamic changes of molecular makers ([serum and tissue samples: before treatment 2 weeks after treatment and operation timing]; potential molecules such as EGFR EGFR-signaling FGFR FGFR-signaling ERK p53 NF-ÎºB and etc. were evaluated through the immunohistochemical stains mutation analysis mRNA [RT-PCR] single nucleotide polymorphism analysis and FISH analysis). In addition the genetic expression profiles will be compared between afatinib-responsive and afatinib-unresponsive samples. [Expected Results]: The promising clinical activity tolerable toxicity and potential biomarkers of afatinib with and without paclitaxel in TNBC patients receiving neoadjuvant setting will be demonstrated. The results from this study can be used to conduct a larger trial that would allow us to confirm or validate the hypotheses generated.    ,NCT02511847
Breast Cancer,Zoledronic Acid as Adjuvant Treatment of Triple-negative Breast Cancer, Triple-negative breast cancer is a special type of breast cancer with poor prgnosis and limited choices. Chemotherapy is the only choice of adjuvant systemic treatment options. Previous study suggested that zoledronic acid might have anti-tumor effect by eliminating the number of DTCs(Disseminated Tumor Cell )and had been proved to be effective as adjvant therapy in postmenopausal women whose breast cancer was Homonal receptor positive and who were receiving aromatase inhibitors. So it might be able to improve the survival of triple negative breast cancer patients.    ,NCT02595138

PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Huaier Granule in treating women who have triple negative breast cancer that has been surgically removed.    ,NCT02615457
Breast Cancer,Safety and Tolerability of Everolimus in Combination With Eribulin in Triple-negative Breast Cancers, Treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) relies heavily on different regimes of chemotherapeutic agents but remains one of the most challenging subtypes to treat because of the lack of specific therapies. Despite being sensitive to chemotherapy many women with TNBC relapse quickly developing locoregional recurrence or visceral metastasis. Toxicity and chemotherapy resistance are still major limitations in the treatment of patients with TNBC. Despite current trend of targeted therapy development cytotoxic agents are a mainstay of treatment of patients with breast cancer. Further research into new combination of different compounds is needed in order to maximise benefit whilst minimising toxicity. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumor agents. This has been described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with varying mechanisms of action including taxanes and DNA-damaging agents. In the clinic activated PI3K in tumors has been correlated with decreased response to therapy and worse clinical outcomes. The recent biological findings suggest that a PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors may increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents which are considered standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of several solid tumors. The study by the Unitaed state Oncology Research of Huston and the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center randomized 1830 patients with high risk breast cancer to the standard adjuvant treatment with adriamicin cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel versus the experimental adjuvant treatment with adriamicin taxotere (AT) followed by paclitaxel. At 5-years of follow up the AT followed by paclitaxel produced significantly better overall survival (p=0.054) and improved disease free survival (DFS) (p=0.19). Among TNBC patients both DFS (74% versus 79% p=0.1) and overall survival (OS) (79% versus 84% p=0.037) were better in experimental arm. However the main reasons for patients being taken off study treatment were toxicity (85 patients in the control arm and 128 in the experimental arm) and consent withdrawal (18 patients in the control arm and 30 patients in the experimental arm). For this reason research into alternatives has intensified thus resulting in the discovery and development of new compounds with a more tolerable profile as compared with paclitaxel. Among the total of 762 patients enrolled into Eisai Metastatic Breast Cancer Study Assessing Physician's Choice Versus E7389 (EMBRACE) trial 19% had TNBC. Of note eribulin was most effective in hormone receptor-negative patients and in TNBC patients who had a 29% risk reduction. Treatment with eribulin was well tolerated. Neutropenia leucopenia peripheral neuropathy and asthenia/fatigue were the most common adverse events reported at Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades 3 and 4. Neutropenia was the most common adverse events reported at CTCAE grade 4 in the eribulin group (24.1%). Based on findings to date eribulin is an attractive agent and its role in combination with new compounds such as everolimus deserves further investigations. Their combination might lead to more profound effects on tumor cell biology of triple negative metastatic breast cancer. During the course of the trial dose reductions for each combination will be permitted in patients who cannot tolerate the starting dose    ,NCT02616848
Breast Cancer,A Pilot Surveillance Study to Monitor Natural Killer Cells and Circulating Tumor Cells in Women With Previously Treated Non-metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer and Women With Previously Treated Non-metastatic Breast Cancer With a Confirmed BRCA Mutation., The purpose of this research study is:   -  To test blood for the presence of tumor derived circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using an investigational medical device called the LiquidBiopsyÂ®. Using the LiquidBiopsyÂ® platform recovered cells or DNA can also be investigated to obtain genetic information that may be useful to treating physicians in understanding disease.   -  To test blood for natural killer cells (NK cells) which are part of the body's natural immune defense against tumors. A device called the NK VueTM Kit will be used for this test. The LiquidBiopsyÂ® is a new investigational device. An investigational device is one that is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The NK VueTM Kit is an investigational device in the United States but is approved in Canada and South Korea as a class II device. If a tumor is present very tiny numbers of tumor cells or the contents of these tumor cells can get dislodged from the tumor and swept into the bloodstream. The LiquidBiopsyÂ® device is able to purify the tiny numbers of tumor cells or ctDNA in the blood. Even if a tumor is too small to be found by other means such as an x-ray it is possible that ctDNA or CTCs may be found in the blood. Genetic information can then be recovered from these cells or DNA to look for genetic changes that are related to the abnormal growth in a tumor. This will potentially allow researchers to study tumor cells or tumor DNA from a blood sample instead of a biopsy sample. This may influence cancer diagnosis treatment and drug selection in the future. NK cells occur naturally in the body and kill tumor cells. This study will measure the activity of the NK cells in blood. A strong correlation between low NK cell activity and increased circulating tumor cells in blood has been reported.    ,NCT02639832

Breast Cancer,The Clinical Significance of Cellular Immune Adjuvant Therapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer, As a special type of breast cancer the triple negative breast cancer has the characteristics of high recurrence rate (2 years after surgery) high distant metastasis rate poor prognosis and short survival time. No matter at home or abroad the clinical researches of the triple negative breast cancer are mainly focused on finding new drugs and new treatment strategies in order to reduce its recurrence and distant metastasis rate. The DC/CIK cell immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy in the clinical study of metastatic triple negative breast cancer has already confirmed benefit. This study is based on the theory that the optimal timing of cellular immunity is while the host tumor load is under the smallest state. Put forward the hypothesis that the DC/CIK cell immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy may improve the disease-free survival and overall surviva after the triple negative breast cancer operation. The investigators intends to use the RCT observing the clinical significance of cellular immune adjuvant therapy of triple negative breast cancer in 340 patients with TNBC.

Breast Cancer,Efficacy and Safety Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Local Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients, The 10%-15% of breast carcinomas known to be 'triple negative (TN)' (not expressing HRs and not exhibiting overexpression Her2) constitutes 85% of all basal-like tumors because it is based on three standard immunohistochemical biomarkers. In clinical routine Docetaxel was widely indicated as first-line therapy for breast cancer patients in adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings. Oxaliplatin trans-1-diaminocyclohexane-platinum may offer advantages over other platinum agents. Oxaliplatin promotes formation of DNA adducts preventing DNA replication and transcription and ultimately causing apoptosis. Oxaliplatin was more potent than cisplatin and the Oxaliplatin-based regimen was active for the patients of lung cancer colorectal cancer and ect. TNBC patients were more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy regimens according to the results of some retrospective studies. There was no report about Oxaliplatin in the chemotherapy setting for breast cancer patients. The investigators hypothesized that using Oxaliplatin adding to docetaxel would be feasible and active in patients with TNLABC because in vitro findings suggest synergism between the agents. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of oxaliplatin-based regimen as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting in triple negative local advanced breast cancer patients    ,NCT01216124

Breast Cancer,A Study of AZD2014 in Combination With Selumetinib in Patients With Advanced Cancers, Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 are two new anti-cancer treatments that AstraZeneca are developing; they are both not yet approved for clinical use. Selumetinib (AZD6244) is a drug that acts by blocking a protein called MEK which has been linked to the development and growth of multiple cancers. AZD2014 is a drug that blocks a protein called mTOR that is involved in the growth and spread of cancer. Blocking the action of either MEK or mTOR alone may slow down or stop the cancer growing. Combining both drugs may make the cancer more sensitive than if Selumetinib (AZD6244) or AZD2014 are used alone and therefore this dual treatment may lead to increased anti-tumour effects. Although Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 given alone and in combination with other anti-cancer drugs have been tested in people with advanced cancer the specific combination of Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 has not been used in people before. Therefore Phase 1b (Dose Escalation Phase) will determine what the recommended dose to use in Phase IIa (Dose Expansion Phase) will be. Efficacy progression free survival duration of response and overall survival will then be assessed in patients with triple-negative breast cancer and Non small cell lung cancer within Phase IIa.    ,NCT02583542

Breast Cancer,Trilaciclib (G1T28) a CDK 4/6 Inhibitor in Combination With Gemcitabine and Carboplatin in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (mTNBC), This is a study to investigate the potential clinical benefit of trilaciclib (G1T28) in preserving the bone marrow and the immune system and enhancing chemotherapy antitumor efficacy when administered prior to carboplatin and gemcitabine (GC therapy) for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer. The study is open-label and approximately 90 patients will be randomly assigned (1:1:1 fashion) to 1 of the 3 following treatment groups:   -  Group 1: GC therapy (Days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles) only (n=30)   -  Group 2: GC therapy (Days 1 and 8) plus trilaciclib (G1T28) on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles (n=30)   -  Group 3: GC therapy (Days 2 and 9) plus trilaciclib (G1T28) on Days 1 2 8 and 9 of 21-day cycles (n=30) The study will include 3 study phases: Screening Phase Treatment Phase and Survival Follow-up Phase. The Treatment Phase begins on the day of first dose with study treatment and completes at the Post-Treatment Visit.    ,NCT02978716
Breast Cancer,Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation as Adjuvant Treatment for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients, Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to any breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptor (ER) progesterone receptor (PR) or Her2/neu. Its incidence is approximately 180000 cases per year. TNBC are known to be more aggressive with poor prognosis specially when no pathologic complete response (pCR) is achieved after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a higher risk of recurrence and a poor survival once that recurrence occurs. On the other hand there is not a specific adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment for these patients. Since autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) allows the usage of higher doses of chemotherapy which results in higher cellular destruction with a decrease of hematological toxicity it is proposed that this procedure is able to improve prognosis in TNBC patients with no pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    ,NCT02670109
Breast Cancer,CISPLATIN + AZD-1775 In Breast Cancer, This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for triple-negative breast cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:   -  Cisplatin   -  AZD1775    ,NCT03012477
Breast Cancer,Addition of Cisplatin to Neoadjuvant Therapy for T Locally Advanced Breast Cancer, The investigators hypotheses that paclitaxel combined with cisplatin in a weekly-based regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is effective and tolerable for locally advanced breast cancer.    ,NCT02199418
Breast Cancer,Weekly Paclitaxel and Cisplatin to Treat Hormone Receptor Positive and Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients, The investigators hypothesize that paclitaxel combined with cisplatin in a weekly-based regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is effective and tolerable for locally advanced breast cancer. In patients with some sub-type advanced breast cancer neo-adjuvant chemotherapy combined with endocrine therapy may improve the pathological remission rate. Premenopausal patients with triple negative breast caner and hormonal receptor positve breast cancer patients will be randominzed to have neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with endocrine therapy or not.    ,NCT02221999
Breast Cancer,Addition of Carboplatin to Neoadjuvant Therapy for Triple-negative and HER2-positive Early Breast Cancer, Study participants with primary breast cancer will receive a standard chemotherapy with an anthracycline and a taxane as well as trastuzumab in case of HER2-positive tumors at doses and duration in concordance to current treatment guidelines. Patients will be receive and benefit in addition currently not in the neoadjuvant setting registered medication as lapatinib or bevacizumab of which significant increases of cure (pCR) rates have been reported in previous phase III studies. Patients randomized to carboplatin will receive in addition to the described backbone therapies a potentially active agent which suggested synergy of efficacy with chemotherapies as well as targeted agents. Patients might have the risk of an increase in toxicities due to the added agents and will have additional burden due to investigations required for study participation. However due to the severity of the underlying disease and the high risk of relapse and death due to the stage of disease this increase in toxicity and burden appears less relevant compared to the potential higher efficacy and finally cure rate by the incorporated treatments.    ,NCT01426880
Breast Cancer,Nanoparticle-based Paclitaxel vs Solvent-based Paclitaxel as Part of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Early Breast Cancer (GeparSepto), Current guidelines as those from the AGO-Breast commission recommend for neoadjuvant breast cancer patients either a sequence of 4 cycles EC followed by 4 cycles of a taxane or 6 cycles of TAC based on previous large scale studies. Treatment of patients with HER2-positive disease should include also simultaneous application of trastuzumab. Solvent-based taxanes (paclitaxel docetaxel) cause severe toxicities not only by the active agents itself but also by the solvents like cremophor. Nab-paclitaxel (AbraxaneÂ®) is a solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel encapsulated in albumin. It does not require premedication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to prevent the risk of solvent-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. This new formulation improves safety profile allows higher dosing with shorter infusion duration and produces higher tumor drug concentration. As neoadjuvant treatment does not only allow to compare competing treatment approaches with a very high quality (homogenous treatment population precise assessment of response by histological assessment) but also to identify predictive markers this trial will compare weekly nab-paclitaxel with solvent-based paclitaxel at their currently optimal doses. In case of HER2-positive tumor status patients receive Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab additionally.    ,NCT01583426
Breast Cancer,A Phase III Trial Comparing Two Dose-dense Dose-intensified Approaches (ETC and PM(Cb)) for Neoadjuvant Treatment of Patients With High-risk Early Breast Cancer (GeparOcto), Two regimen are currently considered to have highest efficacy for patients with high-risk early stage breast cancer: sequential treatment of high dose epirubicin taxane and cyclophosphamide concomitantly with a dual HER2-blockade and weekly treatment with paclitaxel/non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin with dual HER2-blockade or carboplatin. The aim of the GeparOcto study is to compare those two regimen/strategies. Both regimens are myelosuppressive with a significant incidence of chemotherapy induced anaemia. The second aim of the GeparOcto study is therefore to compare the use of parental ferric carboxymaltose versus physician's choice for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with iron deficiency.    ,NCT02125344

Breast Cancer,Dual Blockage With Afatinib and Trastuzumab as Neoadjuvant Treatment for Patients With Locally Advanced or Operable Breast Cancer Receiving Taxane-anthracycline Containing Chemotherapy, Anthracycline/taxane based combination chemotherapy of at least 18 weeks represents the standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting. In HER2 positive disease trastuzumab is given simultaneously. Neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy given simul-taneously with trastuzumab achieves a pCR rate of approx. 40%. Recent data showed that a double blockade of the HER2 receptor (e.g. trastuzumab + lapatinib; trastuzumab + pertuzumab) given together with a few cycles of chemotherapy can increase the pCR rate by approximately 20%. So far there is uncertainty if afatinib (BIBW 2992) an irreversible HER family blocker can lead to an even more complete blockade of the HER2 pathway when given in combination with trastuzumab. The neoadjuvant setting provides the unique opportunity to assess precisely and at short term the effect of systemic treatment by assessing the pCR at surgery. It also allows treating patients with HER2 positive breast cancer before surgery without standard trastuzumab treatment as according to current guideline trastuzumab can also be given sequentially after surgery. The aim of the study is to show that chemotherapy + trastuzumab + afatinib can achieve significant pCR rates.    ,NCT01594177
Breast Cancer,Identification of Early Markers of Response and Resistance to Trastuzumab, The study is a single arm prospective study aiming at identifying biomarkers of early response to trastuzumab. It is a prognostic factor study recruiting all consecutive cases of HER-2 positive breast cancer eligible for a pre-operative treatment by trastuzumab followed by breast conserving surgery. The investigators will study the association between the value of biomarkers measured at diagnosis and the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response (partial and complete response) using a logistic regression (main analysis).    ,NCT01834950

Breast Cancer,The Effect of an Exercise Program in Breast Cancer Patients With Joint Pain While Taking Aromatase Inhibitors., The objective of this study is to determine if patients taking aromatase inhibitors (AI) who are experiencing joint discomfort and stiffness would have reduction in this discomfort and stiffness by participating in a directed exercise program. The overarching objective is to improve patient compliance with the medication and ultimately clinical outcome. In this pilot study we will utilize a scientific approach for proof of concept employing both objective (inflammatory cytokine profiles and Physical Therapy (PT) measurements) and subjective (patient perception) methods to support an evidence based clinical plan. Patients will be divided into two cohorts. Group A will receive AI therapy with a directed exercise program. Group B will receive AI therapy without a directed exercise program. Data will be collected when both cohorts of patients enroll in the study at the end of PT for Group A and at the end of 8 weeks for Group B. At these time points both groups will undergo a PT evaluation; have blood drawn for cytokine profiles; answer questions on an iPad that includes: the Pain Disability Index the PHQ-4 (Psycological Health Questionaire depression scale and pain level scale.    ,NCT02057536
Breast Cancer,BRCA1/2 and Effect of Mifepristone on the Breast, Ovarian steroids as well as their synthetic counterparts gestagens and estrogens have a role in breast cell proliferation and the development of breast cancer. Here the effect of a progesterone receptor modulator mifepristone on cell proliferation in human breast tissue in vivo will be studied in women with BRCA-1 or -2 mutations. Our preliminary results implicate a possible protective effect of mifepristone in breast epithelium. The ability of mifepristone to block breast epithelial cell proliferation may prevent tumorigenesis and may also prove beneficial when used for contraceptive purposes and on other indications. The proposed project concerns a Randomized Controlled Trial on mifepristone versus placebo treatment of women with BRCA-1or -2 mutations with a high risk/incidence of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.    ,NCT01898312
Breast Cancer,A Phase II Study of Dose Density Regimen With Fluorouracil Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide at Days 1 4 Every 14 Days With Filgrastim Support Followed by Weekly Paclitaxel in Women With Primary Breast Cancer., TITLE: A Phase II Study of Dose Density Regimen with Fluorouracil Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide at Days 1 4 Every 14 Days with Filgrastim Support followed by Weekly Paclitaxel in Women with Primary Breast Cancer. PROTOCOL CODE: IRST 174.05 PHASE: II STUDY DESIGN: Pharmacological open-label prospective not randomized monocentric trial DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENT: FEC + filgrastim x 3 cycles q 14-21 days Day 1 and day 4 = FEC (FLUOROURACIL 500 mg/m2 IV infusion of 30 minutes + EPIRUBICIN 60 mg/m2 IV infusion of 1 hour + CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE 500 mg/m2 IV infusion of 30 minutes). From day 7 until hematological recovery = Filgrastim 300 microg s.c. After 21 days from the last FEC cycle = Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 IV infusion of 1hour (weekly for 8 cycles at day 1). NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: in the first stage 11 patients have been planned with an additional 27 patients to the second stage if at least 7 patients complete the planned treatment. OBJECTIVES Primary objective: this trial is designed to assess feasibility of the proposed regimen with regard to toxicity and deliverability. Tolerability is defined as absence of any grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia nausea/vomit and bone pain which might be a consequence of the administration of filgrastim). Deliverability is measured as the percentage of patients who complete the planned treatment. Secondary objectives:   -  Relapse-free survival: measured from enrollment to the first date between date of documented relapse (or death) or date of last tumor assessment (if no documented relapse) or the date of last tumor assessment before the start of any further antitumor therapy not planned in the protocol.   -  Overall survival: measured from enrollment to the date of death of any cause or last follow-up. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES: to evaluate retrospectively potential biomarkers of activity and toxicity of this regimen blood and plasma samples until 15 mL each one will be collected at study entry before first docetaxel administration and 3-4 weeks after last docetaxel administration. Moreover a paraffin block or specimens of the primary tumor will be collected for biological studies. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This trial is designed to assess feasibility of the proposed regimen with regard to toxicity and deliverability. Tolerability is defined as absence of any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia nausea/vomit and bone pain which might be a consequence of the administration of filgrastim). A Simon two-stage design has been used with a 60% tolerability rate considered not promising and an 80% tolerability rate as promising and probability of type I and type II errors has been set to be 0.10. In the first stage 11 patients have been planned with an additional 27 patients to the second stage if at least 7 patients complete the planned treatment. The regimen would be considered tolerable and worthy of further study if at the end of the trial 27 out 38 patients complete the planned treatment.    ,NCT02225652
Breast Cancer,Yoga for Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to examine the use of Eischens yoga for 8 weeks in one cohort of 20 women with stage I and II breast cancer receiving radiation therapy treatment while a second cohort of the same type of and number of patients who instead of yoga will receive standard supportive therapy Questionnaire measuring cancer-related quality of life (FACT-G instrument) and fatigue (Brief Fatique Inventory) will be given to patients at several points.    ,NCT01985945
Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer 2-PREVENT Translational Center of Excellence (TCE) - Metastatic Markers of Recurrent Tumor Phenotype for Breast Cancer, This is a cohort study of women with suspected or confirmed recurrent breast cancer with accessible tumor by standard clinical biopsy prior to starting a new therapy for recurrent metastatic disease. Study participants will be ascertained from the population of all persons greater than eighteen years of age receiving care at the clinical practices of the Rowan Breast Center (RBC) at the University of Pennsylvania. The overarching goal of this study is to identify the genetic and molecular markers of molecular evolution identified in patients who have progressed from a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to recurrent metastatic disease. As an observational study this study seeks to gather data regarding the molecular and genetic changes that a primary cancer undergoes as a patient's cancer recurs and ultimately progresses. We anticipate enrolling 50 women with recurrent breast cancer who meet eligibility requirements for this study. Participation in this study will include the following: a biopsy and blood collection completion of the study questionnaire an optional bone marrow aspiration and repeat collection of blood offer of a research biopsy and a optional bone marrow aspirate collection at each progression time point. The study participants' medical information will be updated and changes in disease status will be captured on a regular basis.    ,NCT02530008
Breast Cancer,A Mindfulness Meditation-Based Intervention for Younger Breast Cancer Survivors, Younger women with breast cancer experience substantially greater distress and depressive symptoms than older women. These symptoms can hamper recovery and healthy behaviors that can reduce the risk of recurrence and/or other chronic diseases. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a mindfulness meditation-based intervention for this at-risk group of women. The investigators hypothesize that a structured program of mindfulness meditation will lead to significant improvements in psychological well-being (i.e. depression stress) with corresponding improvements in health behaviors and biomarkers of cancer risk in women diagnosed with breast cancer prior to age 50. The investigators will also examine mechanisms for intervention effects including increased mindfulness and ability to relax.    ,NCT01558258
Breast Cancer,Effect of Preoperative Chemotherapy on Axillary Lymph Node Metastases in Stage II Breast Cancer: A Prospective Randomized Trial, Patients with untreated clinical stage II breast cancer are eligible. An excisional biopsy of the primary tumor is acceptable but without definitive local therapy or prior chemotherapy. Histologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma is required. Patients are prospectively randomized to receive five 21-day cycles of dose-intense (5-fluorouracil adriamycin leucovorin cytoxan granuloctye-colony stimulating factor [FLAC/G-CSF]) chemotherapy either before (preoperative) or after (postoperative) local therapy. Chemotherapy is given as an outpatient. For patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy local therapy (modified radical mastectomy or breast segmentectomy/axillary dissection/breast radiotherapy according to patient preference) is performed 3-4 weeks after last chemotherapy. For patients receiving postoperative chemotherapy chemotherapy will begin 2-3 weeks after local therapy. Immediate reconstruction for mastectomy is acceptable. Upon completion of local therapy and chemotherapy in either treatment group all estrogen receptor positive patients receive tamoxifen for 5 years. Follow-up consists of history and physical examination each 3 months for first 3 years each six months for years 4 and 5 and yearly thereafter. Mammogram bone scan chest x-ray and blood work are performed yearly.    ,NCT00001250
Breast Cancer,Autologous T-Cell Transplantation and the Immunotherapy of Residual Disease in Breast Cancer: Pilot Study of Vaccine-Driven T-Cell Expansion in Patients Treated With Dose-Intensive Chemotherapy, The ability of chemotherapy to cure cancer including breast cancer has been limited by drug resistant residual tumor cells remaining after chemotherapy that generally result in relapse. Additional therapeutic strategies to eradicate these residual tumor cells are needed. The augmentation of specific anti-tumor immune responses such as those mediated by T-cells might represent such an additional strategy for the control or elimination of residual tumor cells. This approach might be especially effective if T-cell mediated responses were enhanced during both the period of T-cell repopulation that follows acute T-cell depletion and in the setting of minimal residual tumor burden present after dose intensive chemotherapy. Such chemotherapy is known to result in severe T-cell depletion. This pilot study has been designed to examine the feasibility of combining dose intensive chemotherapy with interventions aimed at the reconstitution of T-cell immunity. Metastatic or adjuvant breast cancer patients who have received dose intensive chemotherapy will subsequently receive a combination of autologous chemotherapy-naive T-cells a patient-specific tumor antigen vaccine and recombinant human interleukin-2. These interventions will be assessed for their ability to modulate T-cell number T-cell function and T-cell specificity during the period of T-cell repopulation. Such modulation may result in the effective reconstitution of generalized T-cell immunity with the generation of vaccine-specific anti-tumor T-cell responses.    ,NCT00001440
Breast Cancer,Establishment of Normal Breast Epithelial Cell Lines From Patients at High Risk for Breast Cancer, Women who are at high risk for breast cancer either because of linkage to high risk breast and ovarian cancer families or because of a carcinoma in the opposite breast will be studied. Women will have a physical examination and mammography to ensure that no breast abnormalities are present. Eligible women will undergo biopsy of the breast to obtain normal breast tissue. Short-term cell cultures will be established from this tissue and early passages of the short-term cell lines will be stored. A bank of high risk normal mammary epithelial cells will be established. To further characterize the mammary epithelial cells in this population of women cell cultures will subsequently be analyzed for their growth and metabolic properties sensitivity to chemopreventive agents steroid receptor characteristics oncogene expression and regulation and genetic changes.    ,NCT00001496
Breast Cancer,Chemotherapy and Progenitor Cell Transplantation to Treat Inflammatory Breast Cancer, This study will evaluate the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel (Taxol) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) followed by high-dose melphalan and etoposide for treating inflammatory breast cancer. Patients also receive infusions of their own previously collected progenitor cells (primitive cells that can make new cells to replace ones destroyed by chemotherapy). Patients 18 years of age or older with stage IIIB inflammatory breast cancer that has not metastasized (spread beyond the breast) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination blood and urine tests and chest x-ray. They have computed tomography (CT) of the head chest abdomen and pelvis as well as a bone scan to determine the extent of disease and a nuclear medicine scan called MUGA to examine the heart's pumping ability. They may receive a rehabilitation medicine evaluation. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  Central venous line placement: Patients have a central venous line (plastic tube) placed into a major vein in the chest before beginning treatment. The line remains in the body throughout treatment and is used to give chemotherapy and other medications and to withdraw blood samples. The line is usually placed under local anesthesia in the radiology department or the operating room.   -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive two or more cycles of paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide. Paclitaxel is given intravenously (I.V. through a vein) for 72 hours using a portable pump. Cyclophosphamide is given daily for 3 days I.V. over 1 hour. The cycles may be 28 days apart. A drug called Mesna is given with this treatment to protect the bladder from irritation from cyclophosphamide. Patients who have not previously been treated with doxorubicin (Adriamycin) may receive a maximum of four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide by vein on a single day during each cycle with cycles 21 days apart. When all the paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide cycles are completed patients receive melphalan and etoposide both drugs I.V. over 1 to 8 hours for three consecutive days.   -  G-CSF treatment: After each paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide cycle and after the melphalan/etoposide treatment patients are given a drug called G-CSF. G-CSF injected under the skin stimulates production of infection-fighting white blood cells.   -  Apheresis: This is a procedure to collect progenitor cells for later reinfusion. For this procedure blood is collected through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in an arm vein. The blood is circulated through a cell-separating machine where the white cells including the progenitor cells are extracted and the red cells are returned to the patient through another catheter in the other arm. Apheresis is done after each of two cycles of paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide.   -  Progenitor cell transplant: Progenitor cells are reinfused after melphalan/etoposide treatment.   -  Glucose infusion: A salt solution with chemically modified glucose is infused I.V. over a period of from 12 to 48 hours with subsequent donation of blood cells for blood and immune system studies. Patients have a maximum of two glucose infusions separated by at least 3 months.   -  Tumor biopsy: Some patients have a biopsy of their tumor (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue for microscopic study) before starting chemotherapy.   -  Blood tests: Blood is drawn frequently to monitor safety and treatment response and for research purposes.   -  Dental consultation: Some patients may have a dental consultation before the progenitor cell transplant.    ,NCT00001507
Breast Cancer,Microarray Analysis for Human Genetic Disease, This study will look at genetic changes which occur in the development of male and female breast cancer and other cancer. It will use a new technology called DNA microarray hybridization that looks at a wide array of genes to identify disease-associated patterns in the human genome (complete set of human genes). Numerous studies have linked particular genes to a given disease but there is very little information on patterns of gene expression (production of proteins from genetic coding) in the entire human genome. Pinpointing genetic abnormalities in disease may help classify different forms of cancer and perhaps lead to new avenues of treatment or prevention. A primary goal of this study will be to create a database of gene expression for human cancers and other disorders that will provide the basis for finding genetic abnormalities in disease. Tumors specimens used in this study will be taken from tissues biopsied from patients with breast colon cancer sarcomas or melanoma as part of their routine care. Patients in the study will be among those receiving care at the: Department of Oncology University Hospital University of Lund Sweden (breast cancer); Department of Medicine University of Michigan Ann Arbor Michigan (breast cancer); Surgery Branch National Cancer Institute Bethesda Maryland (melanoma) Johns Hopkins Univ. (colon cancer) Memorial Sloan Kettering (sarcoma). Patients in the study will have a family history taken and will complete a questionnaire. Some patients will be asked to have a blood test. Breast cancer patients will have a mammogram if one has not been done within the last year.    ,NCT00001898

Breast Cancer,Weekly Vinorelbine and Oral Capecitabine as Treatment for Stage IV Breast Cancer, The primary purpose of the study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of combination therapy consisting of daily oral capecitabine and weekly intravenous vinorelbine in stage IV breast cancer subjects. The study is designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy. Safety will be assessed by analyzing the types of toxicity the severity of toxicity and the need for dose modification or delay due to toxicity. Effectiveness will be assessed by analyzing response rates time to treatment failure time to progression and overall survival. Our hypothesis is that the regimen will be more effective than standard historic regimens for this type and stage of cancer.    ,NCT00194727
Breast Cancer,Taxotere Plus Weekly Navelbine and G-CSF: A Study in Stage IV Breast Cancer," The two drugs used to treat metastatic breast cancer in this study may perform better when used together than when used separately. The use of another drug that prevents the most common side effect of the two-drug combination permits the delivery of both agents at closer to the ""full"" dose for either when used alone. We hypothesize that the two-drug combination used with G-CSF support will be more effective and less toxic than other standard regimens for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.    ",NCT00194740
Breast Cancer,Adjuvant Therapy for High-Risk Breast Cancer With Wkly Adriamycin & Oral Cytoxan With G-CSF for 12 Wks; Wkly Taxol x 12, The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of treatment with 12 weeks of Adriamycin with daily oral Cytoxan with G-CSF support followed by 12 weeks of Taxol. Feasibility will be assessed by comparing the delivered dose intensity of each drug to the delivered dose intensity in previous trials. Toxicity will be assessed by comparing the incidence and severity of toxicity with these drugs to previous trials using these drugs in the same combination. We hypothesize metronomic dose dense treatment as given in this study will be less toxic and more effective than historical regimens using the same drugs in a less metronomic dose dense manner.    ,NCT00194753

Breast Cancer,Yoga to Reduce Cancer Fatigue, A randomized trial from the British National Health Service found that supervised exercise benefits women with early stage breast cancer with improved functional and psychological benefit after a 12-week intervention and 6 months later. Considering the needs of breast cancer patients and survivors and the reported benefits of exercise and yoga intervention the investigators propose a pilot study of an 8-week yoga intervention in breast cancer patients. This study would specifically address measures of fatigue and psychosocial distress in the population of breast cancer patients during treatment and within the year following treatment. Currently there is very limited literature on yoga intervention in this population.    ,NCT00583739
Breast Cancer,Strength Training for Older Breast Cancer Survivors, Women aged 50 and older are disproportionately affected by breast cancer not only in terms of new diagnoses but also in terms of survivorship. Approximately 85% of women who receive a first diagnosis of breast cancer are aged 50 and over thus older women constitute the largest group of breast cancer survivors. Yet few studies have focused on evaluating whether physical activity and exercise interventions affect long-term symptoms physical fitness and function and body composition of older breast cancer survivors. Due to the combined effects of breast cancer related treatments and aging it is likely that exercise is even more beneficial for older breast cancer survivors than for younger survivors. Along with the cancer-related symptom of fatigue common to cancer survivors older survivors face age-related declines in bone and muscle mass muscle strength bone health and physical function (gait and balance) that are likely exacerbated by reduced physical activity in survivorship and side effects of adjuvant cancer treatment. All women regardless of age are at risk for breast cancer recurrence. Recent epidemiologic evidence suggests a link between exercise and reduced risk of cancer recurrence in breast cancer survivors. Strength training is specifically suited to reverse or slow age-related declines in bone muscle strength and function and has shown promise to reduce cancer-related fatigue. However no controlled trials of strength training in older breast cancer survivors have been conducted.    ,NCT00591747

Breast Cancer,Feasibility Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Early Breast Cancer, Most women with early breast cancer are treated with breast conserving therapy (BCT) consisting of breast conserving surgery (surgery to remove the cancer itself) followed by radiation to the breast. This treatment can take time and is associated with its own side effect profile. An innovative radiation technique called stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can deliver large doses of radiation precisely to the tumour while avoiding critical organs therefore destroying the cancer and avoiding surgery altogether. SBRT has been successfully used for a number of cancers and it is proposed that it could be used to eradicate breast cancer. This feasibility study will investigate the feasibility and safety of treatment using SBRT in women with early stage breast cancer. Thirty-two women age 70 years or older with early breast cancer will be treated with SBRT (5 treatments) followed by breast conserving surgery and hormonal therapy. An MRI and breast conserving surgery will be performed at 8-12 weeks after radiation to assess response to treatment. The primary outcome of the study will be feasibility meaning the ability to deliver radiation treatment as planned. Secondary outcomes will include treatment related toxicity and pathological response. If this study shows that SBRT can be used to treat patients primarily it will lead to further evaluation of SBRT for early breast cancer.    ,NCT02065960

In this study the ability of the SAVI SCOUT to guide surgeons to find a lesion will be evaluated instead of the standard technique of wire localization.    ,NCT02370082
Breast Cancer,Comparison of FlexHD and Alloderm Outcomes in Breast Reconstructive Surgery, FlexHD and Alloderm are two common products used in breast reconstruction to hold tissue expanders and implants in place. There have been few chart review studies comparing outcomes between the two materials in breast reconstruction. These studies have determined there is no difference in complication rates between the two materials. However there have never been any active studies to date. This study will serve as a randomized controlled trial comparing FlexHD and Alloderm. Several outcomes will be measured based off of inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine if either product is more suitable for use in breast reconstruction. This will be performed by randomly assigning patients to receive either FlexHD or Alloderm. Designated outcomes will be followed closely postoperatively. Outcomes will be statistically analyzed to determine complication rates between FlexHD and Alloderm and thus which product is better to use in breast reconstruction.    ,NCT02372305

Breast Cancer,RISAS Procedure in Node Positive Breast Cancer Following NAC, Chemotherapy in clinically node positive breast cancer patients is increasingly administrated in a neoadjuvant setting. The standard treatment regimen in these cases is then: neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by breast surgery and an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). NAC results in axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) in 1 out of 3 patients indicating a complete absence of axillary metastases after completion of NAC. In such events ALND can be regarded as overtreatment that creates unnecessary morbidity. Less invasive axillary surgery which can accurately assess axillary pCR is therefore preferred over standard ALND in all patients. In case of detection of remaining axillary lymph node metastases by this less invasive axillary surgical procedure completion axillary treatment is standard of care. The novel RISAS procedure is introduced as a possible less invasive axillary staging procedure. RISAS procedure contains Radioactive Iodine Seed localisation in the Axilla in axillary node positive breast cancer combined with a Sentinel node procedure. The iodine seed in the axillary lymph node metastasis will be placed prior to start of NAC.    ,NCT02800317

Breast Cancer,Implementation of Provision of Balanced Information on Mammography in Family Practice, To trial the provision of full information on the benefits and risks of mammography in women that are eligible for breast screening. The knowledge many women have of mammography is not reflective of the recent change in evidence; it is often missing information on over-diagnosis and over-detection. Women tend to overestimate their risk of breast cancer and the benefits of breast screening. In addition universal breast screening programs are biased towards emphasizing screening. However a mammogram is not a perfect test and there is no right or wrong decision about whether to have a screening mammogram. It is an individual woman's decision to make. To understand the effect of changing information to reflect the potential for over-diagnosis and over-treatment we will carry out a pragmatic controlled trial of implementation of balanced information on mammography in family practice.    ,NCT02914197

Breast Cancer,Decongestive Exercise and Compression for Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema Management, Women who have undergone breast cancer surgery may develop swelling of the arm on the side the breast cancer occurred. If the swelling becomes chronic it is called lymphedema. This study will examine the effect of a 12-week decongestive progressive resistance exercise with advanced compression on breast cancer related lymphedema. Our objective is to determine if breast cancer survivors are willing and able to wear advanced compression while exercising and if the combination will help to reduce their lymphedema. Twenty-four breast cancer survivors from Edmonton Alberta will be enrolled in the one-year long study.    ,NCT02992782
Breast Cancer,Reduced Contrast Administration in Contrast-enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM), The optimal dose of iodine based contrast agents used in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is unknown. If CESM performed with lower dose of iodine based contrast agent visualizes a tumor comparable to CESM with regular dose of contrast agent patients can receive less contrast agent for CESM in future and thereby risking less side effects of the contrast agent. In order to study whether CESM remains unchanged at smaller amounts of contrast administration a second CESM exam will be performed within one week of the first with a an alternative amount of contrast it being either 80% 60% or 40% of the original contrast dose. The settings of the CESM unit will remain unchanged.    ,NCT03008031

Breast Cancer,The Clinical Significance of Internal Mammary Lymph Node Irradiation in Axillary Lymph Node Positive Breast Cancer Patients, In addition to axillary lymph node (ALN) internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) chain is also the first-echelon nodal drainage site for metastasis and it provides important prognostic information in breast cancer patients. However decision about local treatment of IMLN is still being made based on ALN status. The 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines recommend internal mammary lymph node irradiation for patients with more than 4 positive ALNs (category 1) and strongly consider irradiation for patients with 1 to 3 positive ALNs (category 2A). Therefore there will be patients in positive ALN subgroup who just face complications of an unnecessary radiation to IMLN and there will be patients in negative ALN subgroup who do not receive adjuvant radiation therapy they really need. Thus these inclusion criteria of National Comprehensive Cancer Network might lead to over-treatment and under-treatment. Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) provides a less invasive method of assessing the IMLN than surgical dissection. However low visualization rate of IM-SLN has been a restriction of IM-SLNB. A modified radiotracer injection technique was established in our previous study. This technique could significantly improve the IM-SLN detection rate. The investigators have validated the accurate of the hypothesis and the modified radiotracer injection technique in the previous study. Recently the investigators propose that if IM-SLN is the only metastatic lymph node and there would be no positive node else in IMLN chain the radiotherapy and its associated complications could be avoided in these patients. On the other hand if there is the presence of metastatic non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) in IMLN chain after IM-SLNB it is important to predict the risk of IM-NSLN metastasis in IM-SLN positive patients. As there is currently no such model a predictive model for IM-SLN positive patients to avoid radiotherapy is needed in this situation. Therefore a new study will be conducted to verify the issues above. In the current study all the participants (18~70 years of age) would have the preoperative pathology of invasive breast cancer and positive fine-needle aspiration result in their clinical or ultrasonic suspicious axillary lymph node. 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid was injected into the parenchyma under the ultrasound guidance 3 to 18 hours before surgery. Two syringes of 9.25 to 18.5MBq 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid in 0.5 to 0.7mL volume were injected at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions 0.5 to 1.0 cm from areola (about 2.0~4.0 cm from the nipple). IM-SLNB was performed in all participants with IMSLN visualized on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and/or detected by the intra-operative gamma probe. All hotspots in the internal mammary basin were harvested and intra-operative identification of the IM-SLN was based on gamma probe detection. The IM-SLN was sectioned along the long axis into two blocks and all blocks were tested by the frozen section and the touch imprint cytology intra-operatively. Those participants with positive intra-operative results received IMLN dissection. Finally all the IM-SLN blocks and IM-NSLN dissected were assessed post-operatively by H&E and Cytokeratin 19 stained immunohistochemistry. The conclusion would be drawn through the results mentioned above.    ,NCT03024463

In the control group patients will be treated with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.    ,NCT03011060
Breast Cancer,iNPWT in Immediate Breast Reconstruction, Due to the Danish breast cancer-screening programme and the increased use of genetic counselling Danish women are being diagnosed with breast cancer or a high lifetime risk of developing breast cancer at a younger age than previously. An increasing proportion of these women pursue an immediate breast reconstruction where the breast is removed and reconstructed in a single surgical procedure. As some of these women will need to undergo adjuvant cancer therapy after their breast surgery fast recovery is essential in order for the adjuvant therapy not to be delayed. With the development of new surgical techniques the complication rate to the immediate breast reconstructions has improved. However wound-healing issues remain one of the most common complications to the surgery with the possibility of delaying the adjuvant therapy and diminish the aesthetic result. Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) is a new approach for surgical site closure. Recently iNPWT has shown promising results in lowering post-operative complications including wound-healing issues in other surgical settings. However iNPWT has still not been studied in an immediate breast reconstructive setting. The current randomized controlled clinical study will investigate if an iNPWT system is able to provide women seeking an immediate breast reconstruction with faster healing and superior aesthetic results compared to the conventional post-operative wound dressings used today. The investigators plan to include 60 women randomized in a 1:1 ratio between iNPWT or conventional wound dressing. The primary outcome measure is the time until removal of the surgical drains which corresponds to the healing progression. Secondarily complications to the surgery assessment of the scar (measured using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale) and patient reported satisfaction with the reconstruction (assessed using the BREAST-Q questionnaire) will be performed. Included patients are examined pre-operatively and at the routine controls at four weeks and four months post operatively. The results from the current study will elucidate if iNPWT aids wound healing after immediate breast reconstruction which would lead to fewer patients experiencing delays before their adjuvant therapy. Furthermore the results from the aesthetic satisfaction will elucidate if iNPWT provides the patients with a better self-reported aesthetic result.    ,NCT03069885

Breast Cancer,A Multimodality Treatment Approach to Patients With Inflammatory Cancer of the Breast and Locally Advanced Non-Inflammatory Stage III Breast Cancer and Stage IV Breast Cancer, This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of high dose melphalan and autologous bone marrow transplantation given as consolidation therapy to patients with inflammatory or metastatic carcinoma of the breast in complete remission. All patients entered will receive induction therapy with cyclophosphamide adriamycin methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil with hormonal synchronization utilizing tamoxifen and premarin as in a previous Medicine Branch protocol (MB-160C). Among patients with inflammatory carcinoma of the breast pathologic complete responders will receive irradiation to the breast and regional lymph nodes; convertible partial responders and clinical complete responders with residual disease on biopsy will undergo surgical resection of bulk disease followed by irradiation of the chest wall and regional lymph nodes excluding the axilla. Both groups of responders will be randomized to receive either systemic consolidation therapy with high dose melphalan (180 mg/M2 total dose over 3 days) and autologous bone marrow transplantation followed by maintenance therapy or maintenance therapy alone. Complete responders in this noninflammatory group will not receive further therapy since historically they have done well following induction and local therapy with maintenance therapy alone. Patients with metastatic breast cancer will be assessed for response throughout induction therapy. Complete and convertable partial responders will receive consolidative therapy and be randomized to ABMT followed by 6 months of maintenance therapy vs. maintenance alone.    ,NCT00001193

Up to three PET scans within one year may be performed. Findings by PET scan will be correlated both with those of concurrent imaging techniques (x-ray CT scan MRI bone scan or mammogram) and with histologic biochemical and flow cytometric information on the tumor and with findings in subsequent surgical specimens. Changes in tumor glucose metabolism with treatment will be assessed by PET imaging studies and by biochemical methods when possible.    ,NCT00001385
Breast Cancer,Outcomes of Education and Counseling for BRCA1 Testing, This study will identify how personal beliefs values and family experiences affect a person's decision as to whether or not to be tested for changes in a gene called BRCA1 or BRCA2. Changes in these genes are associated with a significantly increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer in women a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer in men and a slightly higher risk of colon cancer in both men and women. Families enrolled in the National Cancer Institute's familial cancer research project who also participated in a telephone survey (protocol 78-C-0039) regarding their level of interest in BRCA1/2 testing results may be eligible for this study. All participants will complete a 20- to 30-minute questionnaire assessing knowledge risk perception and personality traits and will participate in an education session to review the following:   -  Information about their individual cancer risk based on family history   -  Potential benefits and risks (medical psychological and social) of BRCA1/2 testing both for those who test positive and those who test negative   -  Overview of DNA testing (what is done and how accurate it may or may not be)   -  Medical management options for those at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer   -  Environmental cancer risk factors   -  Instruction in breast self-examination Participants will then be asked whether or not they want to undergo BRCA1/2 testing Those who want to be tested will be divided into two groups to compare counseling methods (client-centered vs. counselor-driven counseling). A small blood sample (2 to 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for genetic analysis. Test results will be provided in person at a second visit-this may take 6 months or more. A follow-up telephone call 2 weeks after receipt of the test results will address participants' questions and provide support. During a third visit scheduled 6 months after receipt of the test results participants will complete questionnaires evaluating mood attitude self-esteem family interactions cancer screening practices and other factors. Finally 1 year after receipt of the test results participants will be contacted by telephone and asked about their feelings about the test and its outcome. Individuals who choose not to have gene testing will not participate in any in-person sessions after the initial visit. They will be followed with no more than two telephone interviews to assess their feelings and attitudes related to their decision not to be tested. Individuals may reconsider and change their mind at any time regarding their decision-whether to be tested or not. The results of the study will help experts devise the most effective methods of educating and counseling people at high risk for having an altered BRCA1/2 gene.    ,NCT00001468
Breast Cancer,Antimetabolite Induction High-Dose Alkylating Agent Consolidation and Retroviral Transduction of the MDR1 Gene Into Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cells Followed by Intensification Therapy With Sequential Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin for Stage 4 Breast Cancer, This study examines the feasibility of using gene therapy to prevent some of the toxicities of an intensive chemotherapy regimen in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients who do not wish to participate in the gene therapy procedures will be offered identical chemotherapy on a different protocol. Patients will be treated initially with chemotherapy which is active against breast cancer but which has a low potential to hurt blood-forming cells. Then the patient will receive high dose chemotherapy during which time blood cells which are capable of rebuilding patients' bone marrows will be removed from the patients' bloodstream. We will use these blood cell collections to isolate peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) those cells which are thought to be the forbears of all other blood cells. A portion of the PBPCs will be exposed to a disabled virus which either carries genetic material referred to as the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1). The virus will transfer the MDR1 gene into a portion of the patient's PBPCs. The purpose of putting the MDR1 gene into the patients' PBPCs is to try to make these blood cells and their offspring resistant to the toxic effects of certain types of breast cancer chemotherapy. The MDR1 protein (Pgp) that is made from the MDR1 gene makes cells resistant to chemotherapy in laboratory systems by pumping the drug out of cells before the drug is able to kill the cell. Another portion of the patients PBPCs will be exposed to a similar disabled virus carrying a different gene called the NeoR gene. The NeoR gene should not change the effects of chemotherapy on blood forming cells. The purpose of using the NeoR gene is that it will serve as a point of comparison to see if the presence of the MDR1 drug resistance gene really helps blood forming cells withstand subsequent chemotherapy. Patients are then treated with a very high dose of another anti-breast cancer drug one that is very toxic to bone marrow cells and patients will then receive the frozen PBPCs which contain the new genes to help them recover from the chemotherapy. After recovery patients will then be treated with high doses of paclitaxel (Taxol) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin) chemotherapy. Both of these drugs are very active against breast cancer and the MDR1 gene may potentially protect bone marrow cells against these drugs. Samples of peripheral blood cells will be obtained before each of these doses of chemotherapy to determine whether the number of blood cells that contain the MDR1 gene in comparison to the number that contain the NeoR gene has increased in response to the chemotherapy.    ,NCT00001493

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of BAY59-8862 in Taxane-Resistant Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients, Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women in developing countries accounting for approximately one-fifth of all female cancers in the United States. Although mortality rates are declining in some countries it remains the leading cause of death in women aged 40-55 years. The median survival for women with metastatic breast cancer is 2-3 years but there is significant variability in this population. The primary goals of treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer are improvement or maintenance of quality of life and prolongation of survival. The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel were incorporated into the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the 1990's. The usefulness of the taxanes is limited by the development of tumor resistance to these agents. This phase II trial with BAY59-8862 will be conducted to determine the anti-tumor efficacy of BAY59-8862 in taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT00044525
Breast Cancer,Safety and Immunological Response Rate Study of THERATOPEÂ® Vaccine in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients, The purpose of this study is to examine the immunological response rate to administration of the THERATOPEÂ® vaccine in women with stable metastatic breast cancer who are being treated with aromatase inhibitors or FaslodexÂ® and who do not require chemotherapy. Post-menopausal women on aromatase inhibitors or FaslodexÂ® alone and pre-menopausal women on aromatase inhibitors plus luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LH/RH)-agonist may be eligible to be enrolled. Patients must not have had radiotherapy or major surgery within four (4) weeks prior to entering the study. Information about the safety and tolerability of administration of the THERATOPEÂ® vaccine will also be gathered during the course of the study.    ,NCT00046371
Breast Cancer,ABI-007 in Taxol Resistant Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, The anticancer agent paclitaxel (marketed as Taxol) has shown remarkable activity against metastatic breast cancer. However the Taxol formulation requires prolonged administration times and there are safety problems that have been attributed to the solvent rather than the active ingredient paclitaxel. This is a new formulation of paclitaxel that has been found to have fewer safety problems than Taxol and may be administered safely at higher doses. This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of this new formulation of paclitaxel given intravenously once a week for three weeks followed by a rest week. This cycle will be repeated until safety problems or treatment failure require that the patient stop therapy.    ,NCT00046514
Breast Cancer,Study of ABI-007 and Taxol in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, Paclitaxel (Taxol Bristol-Meyers Squibb) has been shown to be very effective against metastatic breast cancer as well as other cancers. Because the Taxol formulation of paclitaxel is dissolved in Cremophor an organic solvent containing castor oil and ethanol prolonged intravenous administration times are required; and because the solvent has caused hypersensitivity reactions a premedication schedule is required. ABI-007 is a new anticancer medication containing the same active ingredient as Taxol paclitaxel but formulated as a protein-stabilized material that is suspended in salt water and administered intravenously. The time of administration is reduced the dose of paclitaxel can be higher than is safe for Taxol and there is no premedication required. This study will determine the efficacy of this new formulation of paclitaxel as compared to Taxol for patients with metastatic breast cancer. This is an open label comparative study so patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the Taxol or ABI-007 forms of paclitaxel but will know what medication they are receiving. Treatment will be repeated every three weeks unless adverse events or treatment failure require discontinuing study medication.    ,NCT00046527
Breast Cancer,Phase II Study to Evaluate Tariquidar (XR9576) a Selective MDR-1 Inhibitor in Chemotherapy Resistant Advanced Breast Cancer, The primary objective of this phase II study is to assess if XR9576 a selective MDR-1 inhibitor is able to reverse primary doxorubicin or taxane resistance in advanced breast cancer. Clinical activity will be measured by objective tumor response rates observed after treatment with XR9576 in combination with taxane or anthracycline containing chemotherapy in patients previously resistant to the same agent(s). The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the biological activity of XR9576 and evaluate MDR-1 expression in these tumors. The MDR-1 inhibitory activity of XR9576 will be evaluated by serial sestamibi scans of the tumor. MDR-1 expression will be detected by immunohistochemistry.    ,NCT00048633
Breast Cancer,Vaccine and Chemotherapy for Previously Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer, This study will evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy and a combination of vaccines to treat metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast) in patients whose cancer cells have a protein called carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) on their surface. Patients who require surgery or radiation therapy or both will receive these treatments as well. Patients 18 years of age and older with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer may be eligible for this study. Newly diagnosed patients may not have received prior chemotherapy. Patients previously diagnosed with local disease may have received chemotherapy or radiation therapy at least 18 months before entering the current study. Patients may have received hormonal therapy for stage IV disease. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination blood and urine tests x-rays heart and lung tests and a test to determine the presence of CEA on their tumor cells. Participants undergo the following procedures:   1. Central venous line: Under local or general anesthesia an intravenous catheter (plastic tube) is inserted into a major vein in the chest. It is used to give chemotherapy and other medications and to withdraw blood samples.   2. Apheresis: Before beginning treatment and at various times before and after chemotherapy patients undergo apheresis to collect white blood cells for later re-infusion at the time of immunizations and to evaluate the body's response to the vaccines. For this procedure blood is collected through the central venous catheter and circulated through a machine that separates the white cells from the rest of the blood. The white cells are removed and frozen for later use. The rest of the blood is returned to the patient through the catheter.   3. First vaccine: Before starting chemotherapy patients receive one subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of a vaccine called rV-CEA-Tricom along with subcutaneous injections of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Sargramostim) a drug that stimulates the bone marrow to release white blood cells and white cell precursors into the bloodstream.   4. Chemotherapy:   -  Taxol (paclitaxel)/Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide): Patients receive three to five cycles of Taxol and Cytoxan. Taxol is given as a continuous 72-hour intravenous (intravenous (IV) through a vein) infusion and Cytoxan is given daily for 3 days intravenously over 1 hour. Cycles are 21 to 42 (usually 28) days. After each cycle patients also receive growth colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (a drug that helps boost white cells.    ,NCT00048893

Breast Cancer,Use of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Assess Tumor-Associated Vasculature in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, This study will examine a non-invasive method to assess vasculature that is the development of a blood supply necessary to the growth of tumors. The hope is to identify the way that genes are expressed within the tumor itself from areas shown as low flow versus those shown as high flow on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Most patients with solid epithelial cancers those that develop on free surfaces or linings inside the body die because of the distant spread of tumors-metastasis. After that spread a cure is more difficult than if the tumors were detected early or locally. Tumors develop a new supply of blood. Traditional anticancer therapies have had the goal of causing a decline in the tumor. Yet by focusing on the tumor's blood supply microscopic differences between tumors and clonal differences within tumors may be avoided. Doing so may overcome tumor resistance to treatment and may result in treatments that can be more universally applied across tumor types. Female patients 18 years of age enrolled in the protocol Analysis of Brain Metastasis in Patients with Breast Cancer with and without Over-Expression of HER-2 who will undergo an MRI scan immediately before surgery will be invited to participate in this study. Patients seen in the oncology outpatient clinic of the NIH Clinical Center or by referral from outside physicians may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo DCE-MRI immediately before the craniotomy-the surgery scheduled-in conjunction with other clinically indicated MRI. The preoperative MRI will take about 30 minutes and the DCE-MRI will take no more than 15 minutes. During the MRI patients will lie still on a table that can slide in and out of a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. They may be asked to lie still for up to 5 minutes at a time. As the scanner takes pictures there will be loud knocking noises and the patients will wear earplugs to muffle the sound. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan and may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. During part of the MRI patients will receive a contrast agent one that is gadolinium-based into a vein. This agent changes the relative brightness or contrast on the MRI image under some conditions. Before that agent is used patients will be asked about any previous allergic reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents.    ,NCT00071357
Breast Cancer,Analysis of Brain Metastasis in Patients With Breast Cancer With and Without Over-Expression of HER-2, This study will examine two subsets of patients with breast cancer metastasis that is spreading to the brain. It will identify genes and proteins that promote metastasis particularly in women who are found to over-express (have more than other people do) the human epidermal growth factor receptor ErbB2 also known as HER-2. The molecular and genetic events that permit tumor metastasis are not well understood. There is intense investigation going on into the process in which tumor cells escape the primary local tumor spread to distant places in the body and find and create conditions that promote growth in those tissues. Metastasis of tumors such as breast cancer to the brain is a common problem. Tumor cells will be analyzed with the use of microarrays. A microarray is a tool for analyzing gene expression consisting of a small membrane or glass slide containing samples of many genes arranged in a regular pattern. The goal is to identify a potential molecular signature. It is hoped that there will be discovery of why some patients are more likely than others to develop a brain metastasis which can have a major negative effect on the quality of life and survival. Female patients 18 years of age with known or evidence by radiology of a breast tumor metastatic to the brain or those who have had a removal of a brain tumor for diagnosis or treatment may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo the following procedures and tests:   -  Craniotomy that is surgical opening of the skull and removal of the brain tumor.   -  Blood specimens taken from a central vein or artery before the operation throughout as needed and for several days afterward to measure blood chemistries blood count and so forth.   -  Physical examination and imaging of the central nervous system before and after surgery.   -  Urine or serum or both pregnancy test of women of childbearing potential. Patients will also undergo blood tests at 3-month intervals after surgery for up to 5 years. The purpose is to determine if there are tumor cells in the blood which may explain how they reached the brain.    ,NCT00071383
Breast Cancer,Irinotecan in Patients With Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Experienced Failure of an Anthracycline a Taxane and Capecitabine, The purpose of this phase II randomized open-label clinical trial is to study 2 schedules of single-agent Irinotecan in women with metastatic breast cancer who have experienced failure of prior therapy with an anthracycline a taxane and capecitabine. Patients will receive Irinotecan capsules either once each day for 5 days or once a day for 14 days in 3 week cycles.    ,NCT00072852
Breast Cancer,Exemestane and Celecoxib in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk for Breast Cancer, The primary goal of this 5-year study is to determine whether exemestane alone or in combination with celecoxib decreases breast tissue density in healthy postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer. Dense breast tissue seen on mammography has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. The study will also examine the effects of exemestane and celecoxib on bone density blood hormone levels and quality of life. Exemestane approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating postmenopausal women with breast cancer lowers the amount of estrogen in the body. Celecoxib approved for treating arthritis pain and for reducing the number or colon polyps in an inherited syndrome is an anti-inflammatory drug. Half of the women in the study will receive exemestane alone and half will receive exemestane and celecoxib together. In December 2004 the arm using exemestane and celecoxib was closed to accrual Postmenopausal women who are at increased risk for developing invasive breast cancer may be eligible to participate. Candidates are screened with breast cancer risk assessment medical history and physical examination blood tests review of medical records if needed breast biopsy and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to assess bone density. For the DEXA scan the subject lies still on a table for about 30 minutes while the spine and hip are scanned using a small amount of radiation. Participants take exemestane in pill form once a day for 2 years. They also take calcium and vitamin D pills daily to help protect bone health. They are followed in the clinic during the course of the study to determine the amount of drug taken and any side effects and for the following tests and procedures:   -  Medical evaluation and blood tests at after 1 and 3 months on study drugs   -  Medical evaluation at 6 months   -  Breast biopsy at screening and then at 12 months   -  dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of the spine mammogram and routine blood tests before starting study drugs and then yearly for 5 years.    ,NCT00073073

Breast Cancer,Stem Cell Transplant With Th2/Tc2 Cells to Treat Advanced Breast Cancer," This Phase 1 trial will investigate the safety of a modified stem cell transplant procedure for treating advanced breast cancer. Patients with cancers can sometimes benefit greatly from transplants of stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into blood cells). In addition to producing new bone marrow and restoring normal blood production and immunity the donated cells fight any residual tumor cells that might have remained in the body in what is called a ""graft-versus-tumor"" effect. However severe problems or sometimes even death may follow these transplants as a result of the high-dose chemotherapy and radiation that accompany the procedure. Also donated immune cells called lymphocytes or T cells sometimes attack healthy tissues in a reaction called graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) damaging organs such as the liver intestines and skin. This study will use the following strategies to try to reduce these risks:   -  ""Induction chemotherapy"" to reduce patients' immunity in an attempt to prevent rejection of the donated stem cells   -  Reduced-intensity conditioning chemotherapy that is easier for the body to tolerate and involves a shorter period of complete immune suppression   -  Removal of lymphocytes from the donor stem cells for transfusion in small quantities at monthly intervals following the stem cell transplant to reduce the risk of GVHD   -  Transplant of specific lymphocytes called Th2/Tc2 cells that may increase the percentage of donor stem cells accepted by the patient without significantly increasing GVHD Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with advanced (stage IV) breast cancer that does not respond to standard therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical and dental examinations x-ray studies and bone marrow biopsies to evaluate disease status blood and urine tests (including a blood test for genetic match with the donor) and lung and heart function tests. Participants have a central venous line (large plastic tube) placed into a major vein. This tube stays in the body during the entire treatment period for infusing the donated stem cells and T lymphocytes giving medications including chemotherapy and other drugs antibiotics and blood transfusions and withdrawing blood samples. Treatment starts with induction chemotherapy in which patients receive one or two cycles of the anti-cancer drugs fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. (One cycle consists of 4 days on drug therapy followed by a 17-day rest period.) G-CSF a drug that boosts white cell production is also given to reduce the risk of infection. Several days before the transplant procedure patients begin conditioning chemotherapy with higher doses of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Three days after the conditioning therapy is completed the stem cells are infused. To help prevent both rejection of the donor stem cells and GVHD patients receive cyclosporine (first by vein and later by mouth) for several weeks after the transplant.

Breast Cancer,Exercise in Women at Risk for Breast Cancer," This 2-part study will examine how much exercise people usually do in the course of their daily lives and how two different types of exercise-stretching and walking-affect the amount of fat in the body and certain hormones in the blood. It will also examine whether exercise can be increased by physician counseling with and without the use of a pedometer and if exercising changes levels of stress anxiety and depression. Breast cancer survivors and women at high risk for breast cancer who are between 18 and 75 years of age and who exercise less than 3 times per week may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination and their endurance and flexibility are tested by stretching exercises and by a 6-minute walk or run. All participants complete study Part 1. Those who are eligible may also participate in Part 2.   -  Part 1: Subjects wear a pedometer (a small device that measures the number of steps taken) on their waistband during all waking hours for 1 week without changing their usual level of activity. Depending on their level of activity subjects may be invited to participate in Part 2 of the study.   -  Part 2: Subjects are placed in either a walking group or a stretching group for 12 weeks. At the end of the 12-week period those in the walking group are offered participation in the stretching group and those in the stretching group are offered participation in the walking group. Walking group participants wear a pedometer every day for 12 weeks. They are asked to gradually increase the number of steps they take each day to keep a record of their daily step count and to report periodically to the study staff on their progress. For 1 week during the study participants also wear a device called an accelerometer that is used to verify the accuracy of the pedometer step counts. Stretching group participants follow a program of stretching exercises for 12 weeks with their progress monitored periodically by staff. During week 12 participants wear a pedometer and accelerometer. All Part 2 participants also have the following tests and procedures:   -  Blood draw: collected at the beginning and end of the study to test for certain hormones and HDL cholesterol levels.   -  Questionnaires: about stress anxiety and depression levels; these are completed at the beginning and end of the study and a detailed questionnaire about diet is completed at home or during a clinic visit.   -  Body composition measurement: A ""bioelectrical impedance"" test which measures body fat is done at the beginning and end of the study. For this test the subject lies on an examining table and a small electrical current is passed through electrodes placed on one hand and one foot. Although a small electrical current is used this test is not painful.   -  Endurance and flexibility testing: At the end of the study participants repeat the 6-minute walk or run endurance test and the stretching flexibility test performed at screening.

Breast Cancer,Study of Fluorodeoxyglucose (FluGlucoScan) in Patients With Breast Cancer: Correlation With Histologic Findings of Sentinel Node Biopsies and Axillary Dissection, Breast cancer affects many women. One of the places to which it can spread is the lymph glands under the arm. The type of treatment offered to patients often will depend on whether those lymph glands have cancer in them or not. For this reason a standard recommendation is that women with breast cancer have these lymph glands removed with surgery. This cancer causes side effects including numbness pain decreased ability to move the arm and arm swelling. A new type of surgery which looks only at the first gland that a cancer drains to (sentinel node biopsy) may help to avoid having to remove the glands under the arm. Also a new way of imaging the glands under the arm called Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning may also give a better idea of the chance that these glands have cancer in them. This study is determining whether PET scans before surgery and sentinel node biopsy can decrease the need for a complete axillary dissection.    ,NCT00123799

Breast Cancer,RCT of a Group Intervention for Women With a Family History of Breast Cancer, One in 10 Canadian women will be diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) and approximately 5% of all BC is believed to be hereditary. Women with a family history experience high levels of perceived risk for developing BC. Elevated risk perceptions for BC have been associated with psychological distress which in turn can interfere with screening adherence. In our completed CBCRI-funded study we developed and standardized a group intervention designed to address the psychological issues associated with having a family history of BC. Results demonstrated that the intervention led to significant improvement in levels of anxiety and depression improved BC risk factors/genetics knowledge and was associated with optimal screening behavior. The proposed study will rigorously test the group intervention in comparison to standard risk counselling in a sample of 150 women recruited from Familial BC clinics in Toronto. The interventions will be examined for their impact on a) psychological functioning b) BC risk/genetic knowledge and c) screening behaviors.    ,NCT00150917

Breast Cancer,Administration of Autologous Dendritic Cells (DCs) Infected With an Adenovirus Expressing Her-2," We the researchers at Hamilton Health Sciences have developed a novel approach to cancer therapy using transfected dendritic cells (DCs) to generate enhanced immunity to defined tumor antigens. Dendritic cells are highly specialized antigen presenting cells found in the bone marrow lymph nodes skin and thymus. Infection of DCs with Adenovirus (Ad) vectors incorporating genes for defined tumor antigens enables intracellular expression and major histocompatability complex (MHC)-restricted presentation of tumor peptides by transfected DCs. Given the potent immunostimulatory properties of DCs and ability to use gene transfer to ""load"" DCs with tumor antigen we hypothesize that administration of transduced autologous DCs may have potential therapeutic benefit as a cancer vaccine. We have examined Ad-tumor antigen DC based vaccination in murine models of breast cancer and melanoma. In both models injection(s) of Ad-transduced DCs results in highly potent immune activation and antigen-specific anti-tumor responses. In these models high levels of antigen-specific cytotoxic effector lymphocytes that recognize and kill cancer cells directly correlates with a therapeutic response (tumor regression and/or complete protection of animals subsequently re-challenged with tumor cells). Animals demonstrating specific in vitro immunity are protected against subsequent injection of cancer cells. Moreover we have observed complete resolution and significant long-term survival in animals with established metastatic disease with no demonstrable toxicity. As opposed to vaccination protocols with tumor peptides or purified epitopes that are MHC-I restricted (i.e. HLA-A2) we have found that injection of DCs transduced with a vector expressing the entire tumor antigen results in peptide presentation from both MHC-I and MHC-II complexes. The subsequent immune response is comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Thus Ad-based gene transfer of tumor antigens appears to be an efficient approach: (1) enabling sustained endogenous peptide processing and (2) facilitating DC-specific presentation to the host immune system. We have shown that using a replication deficient adenovirus vector expressing Her-2/neu DNA under the control of a human mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter that we can transfect bone marrow derived DCs (AdHer2/DC). These cells are then used to immunize recipient mice against tumour challenge with Her2 transgenic tumour cells. The protection is antigen specific (anti Her2). On the basis of these pre-clinical studies we will initiate a pilot trial of the AdHer2/DC vaccine in Her -2/neu overexpressing patients with metastatic breast cancer. Long-term goals and implications of possible results: The goals of this initial pilot phase I study are to evaluate the safety and dosing schedule of the vaccine therapy. The vaccine will be tested in subsequent phase II and III studies to determine efficacy in comparison to standard therapies. The long-term goals are to eventually test this therapy in the adjuvant breast cancer setting in Her-2/neu overexpressing patients.    ",NCT00197522

Breast Cancer,Perioperative Chemotherapy After Primary Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Breast Cancer, The role of early timing of adjuvant chemotherapy was postulated to be particularly important for patients with endocrine non-responsive disease. The role of cytotoxicity during the period of breast surgery itself and immediately after (perioperative chemotherapy) remained unknown. We investigated in a randomized trial the role of perioperative chemotherapy in patients treated with a preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer and compare it to the preoperative chemotherapy without additional cytotoxic therapy during and immediately after definitive surgery. Patients with T2-3 N0-2 M0 breast cancer with both estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PgR) expressed in less than 20% of tumor cells or with absence of progesterone receptors received up to 6 courses of primary systemic therapy with epirubicin 25 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) on days 1 and 2 cisplatin 60 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and 5-fluorouracil 200 mg/m2 i.v. daily as continuous infusion (ECF). Patients achieving a partial or complete remission were randomized to continue the infusion of fluorouracil until 2 weeks after surgery (perioperative treatment arm) or to stop fluorouracil infusion one week before surgery on day 21 of the sixth cycle (control arm).    ,NCT00301548

Breast Cancer,Does a Single Steroid Injection Reduce the Formation of Postmastectomy Seroma, Background Seroma formation is a common problem after mastectomy. The incidence various between 30% to 92%. It is often an ongoing problem after removal of the suction drain and repeated skin puncture is necessary to remove the seroma. In addition to many ambulatory visits this also leads to an increased risk of infection and the adjuvant treatment can be delayed for several weeks Different procedures have been tried to avoid seroma formation. Among these are for ex. : immobilisation of the arm and shoulder after mastectomy different drain regimens closing of the dead space of the cavity different chemical substances as thrombin tranexamacid and fibrin. Non of these results has been successful. Seroma formation is most likely the result of the inflammatory response due to wound healing. In the seroma fluid several factors have been detected that support this assumption. These factors are: high levels of IgG leucocytes granulocytes proteinases proteinases inhibitors different kinds of cytokines ( tPA uPA uPAR PAI-1 PAI-2 IL-6 og IL-1??. On the basis of this an inhibition of the inflammatory response might result in a decrease of seroma formation and perhaps improve quality of life after mastectomy. Steroids inhibit the inflammatory response for example by inhibition of the cytokine function. It has been shown that a high single dose of steroid infusion (30mg/kg solu-medrol) inhibits the normal IL 6 response after colon resection. Newer studies have shown that even at a lower dose the inflammatory response is inhibited. In several studies of head and neck surgery the oedema in surgical area is reduced after a single dose of 125 mg solumedrol. It is precisely this effect of reduced fluid formation we want to obtain in our study. We have therefore chosen to use a single dose of 125 mg of solumedrol in this study. Even at the largest single dose of glucocorticoids there have not been seen any increasing in surgical complications. The aim of the study: To find out whether single dose of glucocorticoid can reduce the seroma formation after mastectomy Study design : A randomised pilot study with 2 x 20 patients. 125 mg solumedrol is given 15 hours before surgery in 20 patients and the other 20 patients are the control group Inclusion criteria: Women with primary breast cancer undergoing a mastectomy with either sentinel node biopsy or complete axillary dissection.    ,NCT00307606
Breast Cancer,Involvement of Endogenous Digitalis-like Compounds in Breast Cancer, The endogenous digitalis-like compounds (DLC)are steroid hormones synthesized and released from the adrenal gland.They are integrated in the feed-back system of the Hypothalami-Pituitary-Adrenal gland axis.One of their remarkable function is to induce apoptosis in malignant cells. Recently accumulating data point to the possibility of using synthetic DLC as new anti-cancer drugs. Less is known about the endogenous metabolism of these compounds in cancer patients. Proceeding from preliminary clinical data which demonstrated significantly reduced DLC plasma levels in breast cancer patients and from in vitro data which showed an impaired release of DLC towards stress stimuli in athymic nude micewe put up the hypothesis that a latent adrenal insufficiency with low DLC levels facilitates the induction and progression of tumor diseases.    ,NCT00310882

Breast Cancer,Studying Normal Breast Tissue and Cancer Risk, Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States. Breast cancer research has been hampered by the difficulty in collecting normal breast tissue. In this study researchers will obtain samples of normal breast tissue from organ donors and will collect risk-factor data from next-of-kin. The purpose of this study is to learn how normal breast develops and responds to stresses that are known to increase a woman s chance of developing breast cancer. Following the breast-tissue donation from 20 volunteers surgical technicians will make small incisions in the skin and tissue of the breast and remove several samples measuring about one-inch. Technicians also will take samples of the uterine lining to estimate the date of the last menstrual period. The tissue will then be sent to the National Cancer Institute for laboratory research studies. Steps will be taken to ensure that the identity of the participants remains confidential.    ,NCT00341692

Subjects will be followed longitudinally until death although the study has been powered so that the primary objective can be addressed after 12 months of follow-up. Healthy volunteers will be asked to provide a blood sample at time of enrollment but will not be followed.    ,NCT00355316
Breast Cancer,Evaluating Patient Information Prescriptions, Research shows that patient satisfaction with medical care correlates strongly with how satisfied they are with the ease of getting information from their providers regarding their medical condition. Although the Internet is a wonderful source of information for patients research has shown that unmediated it comprises a potential quagmire of information poorly matched to users needs. Providers typically do not have enough time to fulfill all of their patients' information needs. One strategy to meeting the patient's information needs is to introduce librarians trained and experienced in consumer health information services into the relationship between the patient and the provider. One recently described tactic is for providers to provide information the way they of provide treatment-through an information prescription (IRx) filled by a librarian. The librarian fills the prescription by offering information services tailored to the needs of individual patients. At Johns Hopkins we have piloted such a tactic and in this project extend and evaluate it. The research hypothesis is that provision of an IRx will improve patient satisfaction provider knowledge and attitudes regarding patient information needs and the efficiencies of care.    ,NCT00355381

Breast Cancer,Testing of Different Methods for Determining Whether Breast Cancer Has Spread to the Lymph Nodes, Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has recently emerged as a less invasive alternative to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in the treatment of breast cancer. However SLNB has a number of limitations and we believe that alternative strategies for staging of the axilla should be explored. The hypothesis of this proposal is that the combination of preoperative high-resolution axillary ultrasound (AUS) fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and molecular analysis using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) represents a viable minimally invasive alternative to SLNB. We propose a prospective cohort study to rigorously assess the diagnostic accuracy of molecular analysis of AUS-FNAB specimens. The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the feasibility of AUS-FNAB and real-time RT-PCR to predict the pathologic status of the axilla in a proof-of-principle study. In the short term validation of this innovative strategy is likely to reduce the number of sentinel node procedures. In the long term we believe that AUS-FNAB may ultimately replace SLNB.    ,NCT00360152

Breast Cancer,The Influence of Breast Cancer Risk and Risk Perception on Lifestyle Behaviors Among Women With a Family History: A Mixed Method Approach," Lifestyle behaviors among women with a family history of breast cancer are likely to be influenced by a number of factors including both objective risk factors and subjective risk or perceived risk. The aims of this mixed method study are twofold and will be explored through both quantitative (i.e. secondary survey data) and qualitative data (i.e. personal in-depth interviews) derived from the Sister Study a large epidemiologic study being conducted through the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences which is addressing risk factors for breast cancer in sisters of women who have had breast cancer. The quantitative aims include an exploration of lifestyle behaviors and behavioral differences between White and African American women as well as well as an exploration of the relationships between lifestyle behaviors (i.e. varying levels of objective risk based on Gail model risk scores medical risk-reducing factors (i.e. use of Tamoxifen or Raloxifene and/or prophylactic surgery) as well as additional factors that may be contributors to perceived risk. This aim will be addressed using data that have already been collected as part of the baseline activities for the Sister Study. The primary qualitative aim is to gain a better understanding about perceived risk and the relationship between perceived risk and lifestyle behaviors in both White and African American women with a family history of breast cancer. This aim requires the collection of new data through in-person interviews with between 28 and 40 women depending on how many interviews are required to achieve ""data saturation."" The mixed method approach will be based on a ""complementarity"" model which emphasizes the use of two different methods to address different aspects of the research problem. Results from both methods will become integrated into the discussion of the findings and it is expected that this approach will enrich the study and allow for elaboration of the quantitative results. The secondary data analysis will be derived from approximately 10000 women initially enrolled in the Sister Study who are between the ages of 35 and 74 and have had at least one sister affected by breast cancer. Women for the qualitative interviews will be recruited from a cohort of Sister Study participants residing within North Carolina and will include equal numbers of both White and African American women. It is expected that 28 women will be needed for qualitative data saturati...    ",NCT00393406

Breast Cancer,Breast Mammogram and Tissue Study, Background: Women whose mammograms show a lot of dense areas are more likely to develop breast cancer and to have cancers that are missed by mammograms. It is unclear why some factors lead to having dense breasts and why having dense breasts increases the risk of developing breast cancer. Objectives: To determine why some women s breasts look dense on mammograms. To determine what types of cells and tissues make up dense areas of breasts and why these tissues may be more likely to become cancerous. Eligibility: Women between 40 and 65 years of age who have not had breast cancer or received medicines or radiation for any type of cancer and who are scheduled to undergo a breast biopsy. Design: This study is conducted at the University of Vermont in collaboration with the NCI. Participants undergo the following:   -  Review of their medical records collected over the last 2 years by the Vermont Mammography Registry.   -  Participation in a short telephone interview.   -  Height and weight measurement.   -  Testing of biopsy tissue collected for diagnosis or treatment.   -  Future contacts regarding health status for up to 10 years including review of additional mammograms removed tissues questionnaires and medical records collected by the Vermont Mammography Registry during the 10-year study. Participants may also undergo the following optional procedures:   -  Provide a mouthwash sample for genetic testing.   -  Provide a blood sample to test for markers of dense mammograms or breast cancer.    ,NCT00475761

Breast Cancer,German Preoperative Adriamycin Docetaxel Study, The primary objective of this trial is to determine the rate of pathologically complete remissions following a preoperative dose-intensified therapy with doxorubicin and docetaxel with or without tamoxifen in patients with operable carcinoma of the breast. Secondary aims are to assess the rate of clinical complete and partial responses of breast-conserving operations and the toxicity of chemotherapy with and without tamoxifen. Women meeting the following criteria will be eligible for the study: operable breast cancer (TÂ³3cm N0-2 M0) histologically confirmed diagnosis by core-cut needle or incisional biopsy and measurable disease by mammography or sonography or breast MRI (best appropriate method has to chosen by investigator). After the patients have given written informed consent they will be randomised to the study treatments. All patients are scheduled to receive 4 cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin 50 mg/mÂ² (15-min i.v. infusion) and docetaxel 75 mg/mÂ² (1-h i.v. infusion). The patients allocated to group I additionally receive oral doses of tamoxifen 30 mg once daily starting on the first day of chemotherapy while chemotherapy alone is administered to patients of group II. Cycles should be repeated every 14 days followed by surgery 8 weeks after initiation of the trial. Surgery consists of removal of the remaining tumour (breastconserving resection or mastectomy) and axillary dissection. Patients with no response or even progression of the primary tumour can be treated to the discretion of the investigator but should be followed up according to protocol. If a partial or complete tumour response has been achieved radiotherapy is given to the remaining breast in patients undergoing breast conserving therapy and tamoxifen treatment is continued for a further 5 years. Response will be assessed between the 4th cycle and surgery using the best appropriate method. Clinical evaluation should be performed after each cycle. It is planned to recruite 200 patients during a period of 1 year.    ,NCT00543829

Breast Cancer,Inflammatory Breast Cancer Tumor Markers and Factors Associated With Angiogenesis, This study conducted by the NCI and the George Washington University Medical Center (GWUMC) will examine breast tissue from patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) for tumor markers and factors associated with angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels that is essential for tumor growth and spread. IBC is an extremely rare aggressive form of breast cancer that disproportionately affects young women. The risk factors for IBC its cause and how it develops are unknown but the disease appears to involve a high degree of angiogenesis. Tissue specimens for this study will be obtained from GWUMC's Inflammatory Breast Cancer Registry and Biospecimen Repository. The registry was established to develop a national registry of patients with IBC that includes standardized clinical epidemiological and pathological information along with disease recurrence and survival data. For this study tissue specimens from the repository will be tested for biological markers and angiogenesis parameters to help in the classification of the tumors. Biological markers (such as estrogen receptor progesterone receptor the p53 gene and others) and angiogenesis parameters (such as various proteins involved in vessel formation) will be examined to determine their prevalence in tissue specimens and their relationship to patient survival. When possible the findings will be compared with non-IBC tissue samples.    ,NCT00646555

Breast Cancer,Effects of Rapid Genetic Counseling and Testing in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients, 5-10% of breast cancer patients carry a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Genetic counseling and DNA testing are usually offered to selected patients after primary treatment has been completed (e.g. the first year after diagnosis). For women with a mutation in one of the two breast-ovarian cancer syndrome genes chances of a second breast cancer are high and therefore a proportion of these women may opt for preventive measures in addition to their immediate breast cancer treatment. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy significantly reduces this risk and is associated with a reduction in mortality. Genetic counseling and testing for breast cancer typically takes approximately 4-6 months to complete. However some hospitals and laboratories are now able to generate test results within 3 to 6 weeks. This technology of rapid genetic testing creates new opportunities for providing both women and their treating surgeons with information potentially relevant for deciding between available treatment options including type of surgery and adjuvant therapy. The study will focus on newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who prior to receiving treatment are identified as having at least a 10% risk of carrying a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. We will investigate whether women with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer make use of rapid genetic counseling when offered. Furthermore we will investigate whether the process of genetic counseling (and subsequent DNA testing) has influence on the choice of treatment and whether and how such rapid genetic counseling and testing (RGCT) affects levels of risk perception cancer-related worries and distress and decisional satisfaction.    ,NCT00783822

Breast Cancer,A Pilot Trial of Itraconazole Pharmacokinetics in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, Cancer cells need to be able to make new blood vessels in order to keep growing. This is called angiogenesis. In a laboratory setting the drug itraconazole was shown to help stop the growth of new blood vessels (anti-angiogenesis). It is hoped that itraconazole will prevent new blood vessels from forming in humans too. The purpose of this study is to look at how the body processes and breaks down itraconazole (called pharmacokinetics). This study will also measure markers in your blood to see if itraconazole stops new blood vessels from forming. The safety of itraconazole will also be tested to see what effects (good and bad) it has on you and your breast cancer.    ,NCT00798135

Breast Cancer,Cardiotoxicity of Adjuvant Trastuzumab, Trastuzumab (HerceptinÂ®) increases the chances of cure in patients with Her-2 overexpressing early breast cancer. Unfortunately both the chemotherapy drugs used in this setting (anthracyclines) and trastuzumab are known to cause cardiac dysfunction in a proportion of patients. Patients who develop heart problems when taking trastuzumab might have to stop this treatment which could jeopardise their chances of cure. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) is a cardiac biomarker that is measured in the blood the levels of which have been shown to indicate the presence of heart failure. Some early research has suggested that there may be a correlation between elevated NT pro-BNP and heart damage due to cancer chemotherapy and also trastuzumab. Troponin is another substance measured in the blood that can indicate heart damage. Finally certain variations in an individual's genetic makeup (called polymorphisms) could put them at increased risk of heart damage from trastuzumab. Here we are studying whether any of these factors (NT pro-BNP levels troponin levels or certain genetic polymorphisms) can accurately predict who is at highest risk of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of NT pro-BNP as a predictive biomarker for the development of trastuzumab related cardiotoxicity (TRC). The investigators will also examine if single nucleotide polymorphisms in the HER2 gene or Fc-gamma-receptor genes predict for TRC.    ,NCT00858039

Breast Cancer,Calcitriol Physical Activity and Bone Health in Cancer Survivors, Both the calcitriol and exercise interventions are aimed at reducing fracture risk by maintaining proper bone density thereby preventing osteoporotic/osteopenic conditions and increasing muscle mass. Both calcitriol and exercise are efficacious in maintaining proper bone health and muscle mass among the general population but little research has been done on breast cancer patients and survivors. The combination of calcitriol and exercise which function through different but similar mechanisms could produce interactive effects in reducing fracture risk among breast cancer survivors. Hypothesis: A combination of calcitriol along with a structured home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program will be efficacious in preventing bone resorption and in increasing bone formation among survivors of invasive breast cancer. Primary Objective To collect data on the efficacy and feasibility of a supplementation of calcitriol with/without an accompanying structured home-based walking/progressive resistance exercise program for improving bone health among breast cancer survivors. Secondary Objectives To collect data on the efficacy and feasibility of a supplementation of calcitriol with/without an accompanying structured home-based walking/progressive resistance exercise program for increasing strength among breast cancer survivors.

Breast Cancer,Comparison of Full-Field Digital Mammography With Digital Breast Tomography for Screening Call-Back Rates, This multicenter trial using Hologic digital mammography units will evaluate the specificity of 2-D full field digital mammography (FFDM) versus a combination of 2-D and 3-D tomosynthesis imaging in breast cancer screening. Specificity in this study will be measured by the participant call-back rate by each modality. Varying combinations of 2-D mammography and tomosynthesis projections will be evaluated to optimize the screening paradigm and limit radiation exposure when tomosynthesis is incorporated. Both prospective and retrospective imaging data will be assessed. Hypothesis: Digital breast tomography (DBT) will improve the specificity of breast cancer screening as measured by a reduction in the call-back rate while maintaining the sensitivity of cancer detection. This improved accuracy will be achieved by the optimization of the imaging sequence and number of views obtained at a capped radiation dose in the combined DBT and 2-D screening sequence.    ,NCT01236781

Breast Cancer,Evaluating and Comparing Two Surgical Methods for Treatment of Early Stage Breast Cancer, The goal of this study is to compare two different types of breast surgery. In the first type the doctor removes only the tumor. In the second type the doctor removes the tumor and some of the tissue around the tumor called margins. The amount of breast tissue removed is similar. The removal of the tumor only has up to 40% chance of reoperation because the tumor is too close to the margin. The primary goal of this study is to see if the additional margins can decrease the need to return to the operating room. Both types of surgery are well accepted and participating in the study would not give you a better chance to cure the cancer. At present most breast surgeons remove the tumor without the additional margins. For all patients who have this operation there is a high incidence of return to the operating room for margins re-excision: as many as 40% as patients can have a re-operation. At present we do not know if taking the additional margins prevents the cancer from returning in the breast or not. If the cancer comes back in your breast this is a recurrence and your breast will have to be removed (mastectomy).    ,NCT01271738

Breast Cancer,Tolerability of the Combination of Lapatinib and Trastuzumab in Adults Age 60 or Older With HER2 Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer, This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well lapatinib ditosylate and trastuzumab work in treating older patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or to other parts of the body (metastatic). Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or tumor cancer-killing substances to them. Giving lapatinib ditosylate together with trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells.    ,NCT01273610

Breast Cancer,The Use of Botulinum Toxin A in Two-Stage Tissue Expander/ Implant Breast Reconstruction, Breast reconstruction is a common procedure with over 86000 breast reconstruction procedures performed in the United States in 2009. This is a 1.5-fold increase since 2007. Of these breast reconstructions 65% use a tissue expander/implant technique. Although satisfactory results can be achieved with a single-stage technique a two-stage approach is considered more reliable allowing for precise positioning of the inframammary fold and an opportune time to perform a capsulotomy to increase the breast skin flap by releasing the soft tissue. The placement of the tissue expander and implant under the chest muscles is thought to minimize the incidence of capsular contracture expander exposure and in addition produce acceptable aesthetic results. However discomfort is often associated with this submuscular placement of a tissue expander or implant specifically during the expansion phase. Patients undergoing immediate reconstruction using submuscular implants have been shown to have higher analgesic requirements and to have higher pain scores post-operatively compared to non-reconstructed patients. An uncomfortable reconstruction can lead to under-filling of the expander a longer expansion process abandonment of reconstruction and a compromised quality of life. The use of Botulinum Toxin A (Botox) injections into the chest muscles at the time of surgery may help ease the discomfort that is often associated with this procedure. The investigators propose a prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of patients undergoing tissue expander/implant reconstruction. The information gathered from this analysis will provide a greater understanding of the effects of Botox in the setting of two-stage tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction with the goal to improve patient satisfaction and quality of life.    ,NCT01427400

The investigators want to see the response of breast cancer cell when treated with Chloroquine used in combination with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is an anti-cancer drug that is given through your vein. The chemotherapy used in this study is either Taxane (Paclitaxel) or Taxane-like drugs (Abraxane Ixabepilone or Docetaxel).    ,NCT01446016
Breast Cancer,Decision Support for Women With Breast Cancer, Breast cancer is a common malignancy among women in the United States. There are a variety of treatment decisions that need to be made. This study has been developed after a review of the literature demonstrated that women with breast cancer are making decisions regarding complex therapy issues in a way that is not congruent with their decision-making control preference. Some patients want to be empowered with information so that they can actively participate in the decision making about their care; others want to rely on the recommendations made by the oncologist. This is important because patients who were not satisfied with their adjuvant treatment decision noted a negative effect on quality of life and self image. These patients had more difficulties with treatment side effects; including aches hot flashes pain and mood alteration. In additions the Institute of Medicine recommended that patient centeredness be a key aim of health care organizations and that all patients be given the opportunity to exercise the degree of control they choose over health care decisions that affect them. It is hypothesized that women making decisions regarding adjuvant therapy who are supported to make decisions based on their preferred level of control will have positive psychological outcomes.    ,NCT01447771

Breast Cancer,Trial of Eribulin Followed by Doxorubicin & Cyclophosphamide for Her2-negative Locally Advanced Breast Cancer, Previous studies have shown that chemotherapy has the same effect on treating breast cancer whether you receive it before or after surgery. Receiving chemotherapy before surgery rather than after surgery may allow the patient to have less extensive surgery. The purpose of this study is to identify new treatment regimens with better response rates and to find out if the combination of eribulin followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide can shrink the size of the patient's breast tumor and allow you to preserve your breast. Additionally by receiving chemotherapy before surgery the investigators will be able to determine if your cancer is responsive to chemotherapy.    ,NCT01498588
Breast Cancer,GCC 0901 - Study of How Well Letrozole Works in Combination With Lapatinib Followed by an Addition of Everolimus in Postmenopausal Women With Advanced Endocrine Resistant Breast Cancer," About a third of patients with breast cancer are usually treated by hormone pills called tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase inhibitors are drugs that stop female hormone production. Female hormone or estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast cancer cells. Letrozole is one of the aromatase inhibitors that is approved by the FDA and has been used to treat breast cancer since 1997. However hormone pills usually work for about 6-10 months in most patients. Later on breast cancer will start to grow again. This condition when hormone pills or endocrine therapy no longer work is called ""endocrine resistant"" breast cancer. The scientists here at University of Maryland have discovered how these cancer cells can become resistant to hormone pills. In our laboratory tests the investigators found that lapatinib and everolimus can reverse this resistance and make letrozole work again. However it is not known if the drugs can reverse the resistance in humans. The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of letrozole lapatinib and everolimus is effective in women with breast cancer when hormone pills no longer work. Lapatinib is an anti-cancer drug that is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is the standard of care for the treatment of a particular type of breast cancer called human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. HER2 is a protein involved in the growth of some cancer cells. This study will also include patients with HER2-negative breast cancer. This means that the cancer cells in these patients do not depend on the HER2 protein. The use of lapatinib in these patients is considered experimental. Everolimus is also an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the FDA for kidney cancer. Initial studies in mice and later studies in women with breast cancer have shown that everolimus may also slow the growth of breast cancer. The use of everolimus is experimental in this study.

Breast Cancer,Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Versus Digital Mammography: A National Multicenter Trial, The goal of this study is to determine the value of the new mammography technique called Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) compared to the current standard technique Digital Mammography for the early detection of Breast Cancer. DBT is able to compute a three-dimensional image of a breast from several low-dose mammographies taken from different angles while the device is moving around the breast in a circular motion. This should overcome a significant limitation of Digital Mammography arising from the masking of breast cancer in a mammography image caused by overlying normal breast tissue. This is a study conducted in several Austrian Breast Imaging Centers.    ,NCT01524029
Breast Cancer,Photography or Video in Assessing Breast Reconstruction?, Current qualitative methods of assessing the aesthetic result following breast reconstruction are known to be poor.

If the swelling becomes chronic it is called lymphedema. This study will examine night-time compression system garments for lymphedema. Our objective is to determine if breast cancer survivors are willing and able to use the garment overnight to help control their lymphedema. Thirty breast cancer survivors from Alberta will be enrolled in the 24-week long study. Measurements will be taken of each arm to assess the extent of lymphedema and to measure changes over the study period. We will also examine other outcomes such as the impact of the night-time compression system garment on sleep. The study will provide important information on the feasibility of night-time compression system garments as a self-management strategy for lymphedema.    ,NCT01550250

Breast Cancer,A Study to Assess the Ability of a Novel Endocrine Treatment for Breast Cancer Irosustat to Slow Down Cancer Growth, This study is investigating the effects of a new hormone treatment for breast cancer called Irosustat. Seventy percent of breast cancers in post-menopausal wome rely on oestrogen to grow therefore are likely to respond to hormone therapy. Irosustat blocks a different pathway of steroid synthesis to Aromatase reducing in this way oestrogen levels in the body. As less oestrogen reaches the breast cancer it grows more slowly or stops growing altogether. IPET will recruit postmenopausal women with early hormone sensitive treatment naive breast cancer will receive 40mg of Irosustat once daily for 2 weeks. The effects of Irosustat on breast cancer will be evaluated by PET scans (Positron Emission Tomography) using a radioactive substance called FLT as a tracer. The scans will be performed in a PET-CT scanner which combines a PET scan and a CT scan (Computer Tomography) into one scan. This type of scan can show how body tissues are working as well as what they look like. FLT-PET scans will be performed before and following treatment with Irosustat. As cancer cells grow faster than the normal cells around them they will take up more of the radioactive substance and so stand out clearly on the scan. If Irosustat is slowing down the cancer growth the cancer will take up less of the tracer. Blood samples will be taken at regular intervals to assess what the new drug does to the body and the safety and tolerability of Irosustat will be assessed. The study incorporates translation aspects/endpoints which are based on the collection of tumour biopsies before and after treatment with Irosustat although the later biopsy is not mandatory.    ,NCT01662726
Breast Cancer,Aromatase Inhibitor Host Factors Study, The purpose of this study is to examine how key patient factors including body size affect how well letrozole suppresses circulating estrogen levels.

Breast Cancer,Perioperative Inflammation and Breast Cancer Outcome, It is increasingly recognized the NSAIDS (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug) might prevent the several cancers. In breast cancer the role of NSAIDS (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug) has been suggested.However there was no consistent results. surgery is main cause of inflammation for cancer patients. Therefore we want to know the association between prevention of perioperative inflammation with NSAIDS and breast cancer outcomes.    ,NCT02141139
Breast Cancer,A Pharmacodynamic Study of Sirolimus and Metformin in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors, Given the role of mTOR signaling and probable synergistic activity of combining sirolimus and metformin in patients with advanced solid tumors the investigators hypothesize that:   1. The combination of metformin plus sirolimus will result in reduction of p4EBP1 p70S6K and pAKT more than sirolimus alone in peripheral blood T cells (PBTC).   2. The combination of metformin plus sirolimus will result in decreased levels of serum biomarkers including fasting insulin C-peptide glucose triglycerides LDH IGF-1 IGF-1R IGF-BP and leptin but an increase in adiponectin in peripheral blood.   3. Expression of active forms of AMPK mTOR PI3K PTEN loss AKT LKB1 P62 LC3 and/or ULK1 in the tumor tissue (original pathology) will be predictive of response to combination therapy. This will be an exploratory hypothesis for this study.   4. Sirolimus induced toxicity especially hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia will be mitigated by combining sirolimus with metformin.   5. Metformin plus sirolimus will have promising anti-cancer activity and this activity will correlate with decreases in the above biomarkers. This will be an exploratory hypothesis for this study.    ,NCT02145559

Breast Cancer,Post-Treatment Surveillance in Breast Cancer: Bringing CER to the Alliance, Nearly three million living women have survived breast cancer. Physicians rely on clinical practice guidelines to make decisions on follow-up care. Among other things the goal is to monitor for recurrence or side effects of treatment among survivors. It is unclear whether these guidelines represent the best approach for any given patient as they do not account for differences in disease or patient preferences and may not consider recent advances in imaging and treatment options. We seek to develop a new approach to surveillance following breast cancer treatment which will be more patient-centered and effective than the existing one-size-fits-all approach and will consider individual risk factors.    ,NCT02171078
Breast Cancer,Simultaneous Study of Gemcitabine-Docetaxel Combination Adjuvant Treatment as Well as Extended Bisphosphonate and Surveillance-Trial, This is an open-label multicenter 2x2 factorial design randomized controlled Phase III study comparing the disease free survival after randomisation in patients treated with 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil-Cyclophosphamide(FEC)-chemotherapy followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel(Doc)-chemotherapy versus 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil-Cyclophosphamide(FEC) followed by 3 cycles of Gemcitabine-Docetaxel(DocGemzar)-chemotherapy and to compare the disease free survival after randomisation in patients treated with 2 years of Zoledronate versus 5 years of Zoledronate in patients with early primary breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,Ambulatory SNP Under Local Anaesthesia in a Subgroup of Breast Cancer Patients - Trial, Rationale: In breast cancer (BC) patients lymph node status is a key prognostic indicator. At present axillary ultrasound (US) with subsequent fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of suspicious lymph nodes (US+FNAC) is widely used as a pre-operative staging method. When US+FNAC is negative a sentinel node procedure (SNP) is performed during breast surgery. Nowadays an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is generally performed if one of the abovementioned diagnostic entities reveals lymph node metastases. However the extensive role of ALND in BC patients with lymph node metastases may change or diminish in upcoming years due to emerging evidence that completion ALND (cALND) does not affect disease-free survival and overall survival in early BC patients with (sentinel) node-positive disease. Whether ALND is needed in these patients should be based on (axillary) tumour load. Because of the fact that tumour load can only be reliably evaluated by SNP and not by US+FNAC the role of SNP might become even more important in upcoming years. Ideally the status of this sentinel lymph node is known prior to breast surgery so a patient tailored treatment plan can be made and discussed with the patient before breast surgery. In this context it would be very logical to perform a SNP under local anaesthesia (LA) prior to breast surgery. This might not only lead to significantly less two-step surgical procedures under general anaesthesia (GA) but might also lead to a reduction of depressive symptoms and anxiety and improved quality of life (QoL) of BC patients because BC patients are in particular risk for psychological distress in the first three months after diagnosis of BC. Knowing lymph node status and the complete treatment plan as soon as possible (by performing a SNP under LA) might reduce this psychological distress. To investigate which BC patients would benefit most from SNP under LA the investigators recently analysed 1132 BC patients retrospectively. Both prevalence of axillary lymph node metastases and prevalence of false negative results of US+FNAC were directly associated with age <60 years and with primary breast tumour size >20 mm. Hence these BC patients might benefit most from SNP under LA. In the present study the value of SNP under LA in these BC patients (i.e. <60 years with a breast carcinoma >20 mm) will be analysed. Objectives: Reduction of the mean number of operations under general anaesthesia per patient. Improvement of QoL. Reduction of depressive symptoms and experienced anxiety. Study design: Prospective single centre randomised controlled clinical trial. Study population: Women aged 18 to 60 years who are diagnosed with BC AND with a tumour size of >20 mm ultrasonographically AND with a negative or inconclusive pre-operative US+FNAC. Intervention: Sentinel Node Procedure under Local Anaesthesia (SNP under LA) Control: Traditional Sentinel Node Procedure under General Anaesthesia (SNP under GA) Main study parameters: Primary outcome parameters are the number of operations under GA per patient and the number of operations under LA per patient. Secondary outcome parameters are QoL experienced depressive symptoms and anxiety. Timeline and statistics: The inclusion period will be conducted from the 1st of July 2014 to the 1st of August 2015 and 80 patients will be enrolled in this study (alpha 0.05; power 0.8). Inclusion of 80 patients will be sufficient to reduce the number of two-stage surgical procedures under general anaesthesia with 30%. Data will be analysed using descriptive statistics Chi-squared test Fisher's exact test Mann-Whitney U test Kruskall-Wallis test students t-test ANOVA paired t-test Wilcoxon signed-rank test Friedman test Pearson's and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and finally logistic and linear regression analysis.    ,NCT02187718
Breast Cancer,ForeCYTE Breast Aspirator for Sample Collection and Cytological Testing of Nipple Aspirate Fluid, The purpose of this study is to measure the performance characteristics for the collection fixation and transportation of clinical nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) specimens of the ForeCYTE Breast Aspirator across 3 independent labs and the National Reference Laboratory for Breast Health (NRLBH).

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine whether omitting the sentinel lymph node procedure is not inferior to the current axillary staging regimen in clinically node negative breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving therapy in terms of regional recurrence rate. HYPOTHESIS The sentinel lymph node procedure can be safely omitted in clinically node negative breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving therapy. This will lead to a decreased axillary morbidity rate with a non-inferior regional recurrence- distant-disease free- and overall survival rates.    ,NCT02271828
Breast Cancer,Preoperative Relaxation Training and Acupuncture to Minimize Perioperative Symptoms in Breast Cancer Patients, Breast cancer surgery is associated with presurgical psychological distress and clinically significant side effects including postsurgical pain nausea and fatigue. A few studies have examined how to intervene to assist women undergoing breast cancer surgery. For example presurgical hypnosis has been proven to decrease side effects and even intraoperative anesthesia use. Besides the more psychologically based interventions there are a few studies suggesting positive effects of acupuncture on pain anxiety and nausea in surgery patients.This study aims to investigate whether a presurgical relaxation training acupuncture treatment or a combination of both therapies is able to reduce presurgical psychological distress an postsurgical side effects in breast cancer patients in comparison to usual care.    ,NCT02276404
Breast Cancer,Study Assessing The Interest of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging With Radioisotope Method For Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Breast Cancer, The sentinel node has a fundamental role in the management of early breast cancer. Currently the double detection of blue and radioisotope is recommended. A radioactive material requires the presence of a nuclear medicine department and the approval of health authorities. In many centers this technique is not available. The use of blue is easier to implement technique. However allergic reactions and prolonged breast tattoo led many teams to stop the practice. So in common practice many center use a single method. However with a single detection the risk of false negatives and the identification failure rate increased to a significant extent and the number of sentinel lymph node detected and removed is not enough. Under these conditions find another method of detection seems crucial. According to the literature the fluorescence method (ICG) is a technique that seems safe and reliable. The investigators therefore propose a prospective randomized study to investigate the interest of fluorescence associated with the isotopic method.    ,NCT02279108
Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Cryoprotection Induced Nail Toxicity Docetaxel Low Cumulative Dose, For the specific patient population studied receiving 5-Fluorouracil epirubicin and cyclophosphamide - Docetaxel sequence (cumulative dose <300 mg / m2) using a cryoprotection has never been assessed. The effectiveness of cryoprotection of onycholysis secondary to Docetaxel is not well established in this population (breast cancer in the adjuvant setting) and is based solely on a publication (ScottÃ©) that does not contain the same therapeutic modalities (dose significantly higher). The few studies available have heterogeneous populations nonrandomized retrospective or with a small sample. By extension to what has been observed with higher cumulative doses of docetaxel some teams offer mittens and booties chilled to their patients a practice that is not the subject of a national consensus. The investigators wish to accurately assess the effectiveness of mittens and slippers chilled their tolerance and their observance because of weak data on this specific population in the literature.    ,NCT02283983

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Myocardial Changes During BReast Adenocarcinoma Therapy to Detect Cardiotoxicity Earlier With MRI, Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst Canadian women. 15-20% of early breast cancers have high levels of a protein called HER2 which is associated with worse survival. Treatment of these patients with anthracyclines followed by trastuzumab (which targets HER2) improves survival. Unfortunately these medications together can cause heart muscle injury resulting in heart dysfunction or failure in about 14% and 3.6% of the patients respectively. Once heart failure (HF) occurs about 60% of patients will not live past 2 years. Studies have suggested that patients with heart injury caused by anthracyclines may be more likely to develop HF with addition of trastuzumab. Therefore tests to find early heart injury after anthracyclines may allow doctors to start heart protective medications with the hope of preventing HF. Also animal and small patient studies have shown that an increase in the water levels of the heart muscle (edema) may be an early sign of heart injury from anthracyclines. Cardiac MRI is a unique technique that has been shown to detect edema in various heart diseases. The investigators will test the theory that in women receiving treatment for breast cancer heart edema detected by MRI at the end of anthracyclines will identify patients who will later develop heart dysfunction. MRI studies with novel techniques will be done pre-therapy after anthracyclines during herceptin and at end of all therapy. The investigators will compare patients with and without heart dysfunction to test if patients with heart dysfunction are more likely to have edema after anthracyclines. Ultimately the investigators hope to use cardiac MRI to identify high risk patients and study various heart protective medications to prevent HF. This will improve the personal health of cancer patients by allowing them to live free of heart disease after their cancer therapy. Ultimately at a population level this will allow doctors to provide care that can be uniquely designed for each patient based on their individual risk.    ,NCT02306538

Breast Cancer,A Trial of a New Magnetic Breast Marking Clip, This small pilot will allow surgeons to perform wireless breast lumpectomies using a new magnetic technology. This is a continuation of a previous project testing the technology and the breast surgeons comfort level using this new technology. The aim of this project is to develop a new technique for surgical excision of lesions either through surgical biopsy or lumpectomy. The current standard of care involves placing a needle then slender wire through the lesion under image guidance by a radiologist. The surgeon then removes the lesion using the wire as a guide. This new technique would place a magnet through the lesion under image guidance by a radiologist. The surgeon would then use the MagneProbe in the operating room to locate the magnet and remove the lesion. This new technique would eliminate the use of a wire that protrudes from a patient's breast. This wire is usually placed on the day of surgery prior to the procedure. The goal of this new technique is to eliminate wire placement and increase patient comfort throughout the day of her surgery.    ,NCT02378558
Breast Cancer,Intra-operative Radiotherapy For Women With Ductal Carcinoma in Situ Breast Cancer, Whether the patients with low grade ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer should accept radiationtherapy is uncertain.Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

Breast Cancer,Effect of Kinesiotaping for the Treatment of Hormone-induced Myalgia in Women Given Breast Cancer Survivors, Background: It has been demonstrated that aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are more effective than tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However despite the excellent results the side effects associated with them cause between 24.5 and 31.3% therapy abandon. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of Neuromuscular Taping (NMT) in the treatment of myalgia and arthralgia induced by AIs in women who have had breast cancer. Our goal is to improve their pain decreasing by 20% the values of their Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at various points in order to improve symptoms and increase adherence. Methods/Design: The study includes 156 breast cancer survivors treated with endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) from Virgen de la Victoria Hospital (MÃ¡laga Spain) and musculoskeletal disorders resulting from such treatment. Clinical and patient data were obtained from medical histories genetic and proteomic analysis grip strength and algometry measured questionnaires and the outcome of interest their VAS. NMT is applied in four possible locations according to the symptoms of each participant: carpal tunnel cervical lumbar or lumbar and cervical. There are several more interventions before repeating the readings from the last five weeks of the start of the study.    ,NCT02406794

Breast Cancer,Clinical Trial With Two Physical Therapy Protocols After Breast Cancer Surgery and Immediate Reconstruction, Introduction: physical therapy is essential in preventing motor and functional complications after breast cancer surgery. However there is no prospective randomized study of different physiotherapy approaches in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery with immediate reconstruction. Objectives: to evaluate two physical therapy protocols in patients after breast cancer surgery with immediate reconstruction. A group with shoulder exercises with limited range of motion (ROM) at 90 degrees up to a month after surgery and a group with limited ROM only up to 15 days after surgery. Specific objectives: to evaluate shoulder ROM and pain one week before the surgery on average and 07 15 30 60 90 and 180 days after surgery; assess motor function one week before the surgery on average and 30 and 90 days after surgery; evaluate dehiscence and seroma 07 15 30 60 and 90 days after surgery; associate incidence of seroma and dehiscence with preoperative risk factors and compare all variables (shoulder ROM pain motor function seroma and dehiscence) between the two groups. Methods: women with breast cancer who will be submitted to breast surgery (radical or conservative) followed by immediate reconstruction: alloplastic (tissue expander or breast implant) or oncoplastic (breast reduction or contralateral symmetrization) will be included. Patients that will be submitted to bilateral oncology surgery reconstruction with autologous tissue or breast surgery without reconstruction will not be included. Patients will be recruited just after surgery scheduling and will undergo preoperative evaluation. At this moment preoperative analysis will be conducted with personal data and medical history. Patients will undergo new assessments 07 15 30 60 90 and 180 days after surgery. All patients will receive standard physiotherapy treatment for women undergoing breast reconstruction from Physical Therapy Sector. The protocol consists of early exercise limited to 90Â° of shoulder ROM starting the day after the surgery and repeated 7 days after surgery. After 15 days of surgery the patients will be randomized into two treatment protocols. One group will start to perform exercises with free shoulder ROM. Patients will be told only to limit the movement if they feel pain. The other group will keep shoulder exercises limited to 90Â° up to 30 days after surgery. At that moment (one month after surgery) they will also be allowed to move the shoulder with no restriction. The evaluation of the presence of dehiscence and seroma will occur by inspection and palpation. Shoulder ROM will be investigated through active goniometry of flexion extension adduction abduction internal rotation and external rotation. The pain will be assessed with the Verbal Numerical Scale from 0 to10 and upper limb function through the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire) questionnaire.    ,NCT02480842
Breast Cancer,Identifying Subgroups With High Cardiovascular Risk in Breast Cancer Survivors, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of (sub)clinical cardiovascular disease cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic abnormalities among long-term breast cancer survivors treated with or without anthracyclines in order to identify patients at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.    ,NCT02485626
Breast Cancer,Recombinant Human Endostatin (EndostarTM) Injection in Treatment of Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer, Endostatin has been widely applied for the clinical treatment of partial primary and metastatic solid tumors. Endostatin combined with chemotherapy has achieved favorable progression in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However the research about the efficacy of Endostatin on breast cancer has just started. Breast cancer is a highly-differentiated solid tumor indicating that it is also an indicator for Endostatin therapy. Additionally after chemo- and radiotherapy the primary nidi of patients with advanced breast cancer may also lead to rapid development of tumors in other locations. So Endostatin combined with chemotherapy can also improve the prognosis of patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer but there is rare any report at home and abroad. To further explore the above research this study designed a randomized opened and controlled clinical study to observe the clinical efficacy of EndostarTM Injection combined with GP/NP/GX/NX in the treatment of recurrent metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT02489409

(ii) MEDI4736 can be safely co-administered at full dose with sequential with nab-paclitaxel (100mg/m2) and ddAC (60 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2 respectively).    ,NCT02489448
Breast Cancer,Impact of LOFT Therapy??on Breast Cancer Survivors," The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of LOFT Therapy in breast cancer survivors. In a previous study the investigators found that many patients are more debilitated at diagnosis than previously recognized. Both chemotherapy and anti-estrogen therapy have a large effect. Within 6 months patients replace muscle with fat leading to a significant reduction in muscle power and endurance. Our data suggests that common exercise recommendations for at least 150 minutes of exercise a week would be far beyond many of our patients' physical ability after therapy leading to the soreness injury frustration and early discontinuation (or failure to initiate an exercise program in the first place). The degree of muscle loss seen in our patients is similar to that documented in US astronauts after long-term space flight. Our collaborator Dr. Yvonne Cagle retired USAF flight surgeon noted that the cosmonauts were in better shape (had less muscle atrophy) than the astronauts. This difference was more than could be explained by the rigorous Russian exercise program. The only key distinction was the compressive ""penguin suits"" used by the Russians. This observation lead Dr. Cagle to develop a technique called low intensity off loaded-compressive therapy (LOFT) to replicate the impact of the Russian penguin suits for patients who were debilitated whether by space flight or by chronic conditions such as arthritis Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. The LOFT method does not require excessive exertion or strain on the joints. In field observations LOFT therapy improved muscle strength muscle mass endurance sleep quality and fatigue. This pilot study is the first to evaluate the safety feasibility and biologic impact of LOFT on breast cancer survivors.    ",NCT02491957

Breast Cancer,SurgiMendÂ® vs. Strattice??in Direct to Implant Breast Reconstruction- A Prospective Randomized Trial, An increasing number of women undergo an immediate breast reconstruction where the mastectomy and the breast reconstruction are performed in the same surgery. To aid survival of the mastectomy skin flaps and to provide better aesthetic results acellular dermal matrixes (ADMs) are used to reinforce the breast. There are several different types of ADM available for this purpose. In this randomized clinical trial the following study will investigate two different types of ADM (Strattice??and SurgiMendÂ®) in an immediate breast reconstructive setting. Sixty patients will be allocated on a 1:1 ratio to receive either Strattice??or SurgiMendÂ® ADM. Patients scheduled for immediate breast reconstruction with ADM at pt. of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Aarhus University Hospital Aarhus Denmark will be offered participation. In total 60 patients will be included. Outcome parameters of interest are complication rate patient satisfaction aesthetic result and cost of the procedure. Satisfaction and aesthetic result will be measured at 4 and 12 months post surgery.    ,NCT02521623

Breast Cancer,Acute and Long-term Cardiovascular Toxicity After Modern Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer, In Europe breast cancer is by far the most common form of cancer diagnosed in women today accounting for 29% of all cases. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 90%. Surgery is usually combined with radiotherapy (RT) anthracyclines aromatase inhibitors and/or trastuzumab (Herceptin) which all have improved the life expectancy and survival in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately RT is associated with a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases which includes coronary artery disease valvular dysfunction congestive heart failure and stroke and is the most common non-malignancy cause of death. During the last two decades RT regimens for breast cancer have changed and the doses of radiation to which the heart is exposed are now potentially lower due to new and improved RT techniques. However there are no data on whether these new regimes decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. In this study the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases will be estimated 8 and 15 years after both conventional and laser assisted breath controlled RT and compared with cardiovascular diseases in the general female population. A further aim is to evaluate signs and prevalence of acute cardiotoxicity from RT with the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging coronary fractional flow reserve ECG and inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers and to investigate whether these signs can predict later cardiovascular disease. The importance of traditional cardiovascular risk factors (age hypertension hypercholesterolemia smoking habits and physical activity as registered before RT) will also be evaluated.    ,NCT02541435

Breast Cancer,Evaluating Outcomes of Immediate Breast Reconstruction (POBRAD-M)," Some women with breast cancer have their whole breast removed as part of their treatment (mastectomy). Of these women around 31% have more surgery to create a new breast.There are two main ways to create a new breast(i)using tissue from elsewhere on the body (""autologous"" reconstruction )or (ii)using a silicone implant. In recent years it has been reported that by using a material called an ""acellular dermal matrix"" (ADM) the results of breast reconstruction surgery using an implant can be improved. ADMs are materials which originally come from animal or human skin. They act like a sling supporting the lower part of an implant beneath the skin. Although ADMs have been approved for used in breast reconstruction and are safe there is very little high quality evidence to back up their reported benefits and some studies have suggested their use may in fact increase complications. The main purpose of this study is to find out what the actual risks and benefits of using an ADM in breast reconstruction surgery are. The investigators will follow the progress of women who have an implant based reconstruction to observe if participants develop problems; what those problems are and how participants feel about the results of their surgery. The investigators also follow the progress of women who undergo autologous reconstruction or alternative reconstructive techniques using an implant for the same reasons.    ",NCT02557906

Breast Cancer,Assessment of Breast Cancer Response to Neoadjuvant Anthracycline-based Chemotherapy by FDG-PET and Molecular Markers," A correlation between early changes in the tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on FDG-PET after one or two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and the pathological response after 6 to 8 cycles has been demonstrated in several independent small series of patients. Breast tumor proliferation status has previously been demonstrated to be a good predictive factor of response to chemotherapy. The best method for assessing proliferation status is unclear. Proportion of cells staining for nuclear Ki67 antigen is the most widely used assay for comparing the proliferation status between tumors. However major variations in analytical procedure and interpretation limited its clinical value. Taking into account the prognosis and predictive value of proliferation gene as a common ""signature"" in breast cancer transcriptome analysis quantitative assessment of mRNA expression of genes involved in proliferation has been developed by the investigators team and others. The evaluation of these parameters is quantitative and reliable and can be standardized for a clinical use. The main objective of the investigators study is to early predict pathological response to anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using a combination of parameters based on FDG-PET imaging performed at baseline and after 2 cycles and molecular markers of proliferation measured on pre-treatment biopsy (Ki67 protein level by immunohistochemistry and Ki67 mRNA level and the mRNA (messenger RNA) expression of the most pertinent genes of the Genomic Grade Index (GGI) component by RT (reverse transcriptase) - qPCR).

Breast Cancer,Breast Reconstruction Outcomes With and Without StratticE," Approximately 4000 women undergo a mastectomy for breast cancer each year in the UK and around 1500 will have an immediate breast reconstruction. Approximately half of these ladies will have an implant-based breast reconstruction of which many have an ""implant-assisted"" breast reconstruction with an Acellular Dermal Matrix. Strattice??is an Acellular Dermal Matrix (a pig skin product) made by Acelity. It is used to cover and disguise the lower part of the breast implant. Acellular Dermal Matrices have only been widely used for the last eight years and long-term outcomes for women who have had this form of reconstruction are lacking. Despite this it is one of the most commonly offered methods of breast reconstruction in the UK for both ladies with a diagnosis of breast cancer and in the risk-reduction setting. The objective of this study is to assess long-term outcomes of Strattice??based breast reconstructions in multiple Breast Surgery Centres across the UK. This will be a case-control study comparing women who have had an immediate implant-based breast reconstruction with Strattice??(case) or without (control). This will be achieved by review and analysis of retrospective data from patients who have undergone immediate breast reconstruction using implants with or without Strattice??following either a diagnosis breast cancer or for risk-reduction. In addition there will be a prospective clinical assessment of the reconstruction outcomes. Outcomes assessed will include complications surgical re-interventions and aesthetic results. These will be related to co-morbid conditions and other risk factors. Data will also be collected on unplanned interventions associated with a cost if available.    ",NCT02608593

Breast Cancer,Smart-phone Health Coaching Intervention to Promote Maintenance of Exercise in Breast Cancer Survivors:Protocol, While physical activity (PA) appears to play an important role in disease control and the promotion of long-term health and well-being of cancer survivors the large majority of breast cancer survivors are not physically active. Addressing this problem requires exercise promotion and an additional method of supporting long term exercise adherence. In response an innovative health coaching intervention which uses mobile technology (iMOVE) to promote long-term PA in breast cancer survivors (BrCa) was developed. Project description: 107 inactive BrCa survivors will be randomized to receive a 12-week exercise program (CONTROL) OR a 12 week exercise program plus a concurrent health coaching program (iMOVE) consisting of telephone-based coaching sessions and interactive software delivered through a smart-phone and Fit-bit (wearable fitness technology) (INTERVENTION). Information on the feasibility and acceptability of the methods and intervention and examine the impact on fitness (primary) patient-reported anthropometric and physical (secondary) outcomes will be collected. Impact and relevance: PA has increasingly been identified as a modifiable factor that has the potential to impact cancer outcomes and improve quality of life. iMOVE is an innovative intervention with the potential to promote and maintain physical activity for breast cancer survivors. This study will be the first step in the evaluation of iMOVE and will help to determine whether a larger randomized controlled trial is needed.    ,NCT02620735
Breast Cancer,Women Informed to Screen Depending on Measures of Risk," Most physicians still use a one-size-fits-all approach to breast screening in which all women regardless of their personal history family history or genetics (except BRCA carriers) are recommended to have annual mammograms starting at age 40. Mammograms benefit women by detecting cancers early when they are easier to treat but they are not perfect. Recent news stories have discussed some of the potential harms: large numbers of positive results that cause stressful recalls for additional mammograms and biopsies. With the current screening approach half of the women who undergo annual screening for ten years will have at least one false positive biopsy. Potentially more important are cancer diagnoses for growths that might never come to clinical attention if left alone (called ""overdiagnosis""). This can lead to unnecessary treatment. Even more concerning is evidence that up to 20% of breast cancers detected today may fall into the category of ""overdiagnosis."" This proposal compares annual screening with a risk-based breast cancer screening schedule based upon each woman's personal risk of breast cancer. The investigators have designed the study to be inclusive of all so that even women who might be nervous about being randomly assigned to receive a particular type of care (a procedure that is typical in clinical studies) will still be able to participate by choosing the type of care they receive. For participants in the risk-based screening arm each woman will receive a personal risk assessment that includes her family and medical history breast density measurement and tests for genes (mutations and variations) linked to the development of breast cancer. Women who have the highest personal risk of developing breast cancer will receive more frequent screening while women with a lower personal risk would receive less frequent screening. No woman will be screened less than is recommended by the USPSTF breast cancer screening guidelines. If this study is successful women will gain a realistic understanding of their personal risk of breast cancer as well as strategies to reduce their risk and fewer women will suffer from the anxiety of false positive mammograms and unnecessary biopsies. The investigators believe this study has the potential to transform breast cancer screening in America.    ",NCT02620852
Breast Cancer,Tumor Bed Dose Delivery Using A Breast Specific Radiosurgery Device The Gammapod: (A Clinical Feasibility Study), Conventional breast radiotherapy is delivered to the entirety of the breast in fractionated treatments given over several weeks. While these techniques are effective there is a risk of late adverse events from irradiation of surrounding normal tissues and the protracted nature of the treatments is inconvenient to patients and resource-intensive for health care systems. There is an unmet need for novel treatments that can be delivered more quickly with reduced normal tissue exposure and without compromising efficacy. The GammaPod is a breast-specific radiotherapy delivery device that holds the promise in addressing these needs. Employing the engineering and physics principles from stereotactic radiotherapy it allows delivery of a highly-localized radiation dose to a very limited volume of breast. The Ottawa Hospital is the only Canadian member of a consortium of five academic institutions that have acquired the GammaPod in order to rigorously evaluate its use in clinical trials. The aim of the current project is to complete a mandatory clinical feasibility study of the GammaPod as part of the application for Investigational Testing of Medical Devices from Health Canada. The study will focus on the use of the GammaPod to deliver a radiotherapy boost that is a localized dose of radiation just around the surgical bed in a single treatment.    ,NCT02627313
Breast Cancer,Does Autologous Fat Transplantation Improve Results and Reduce Complications in Breast Reconstruction With Implants?, The purpose of this study is to determine if autologous fat transplantation as a pre-treatment gives better results in breast reconstruction with implants after mastectomy and radiotherapy.

Breast Cancer,Anticancer Treatment of Breast Cancer Related to Cardiotoxicity and Dysfunctional Endothelium, Several cytotoxic regimens are related to endothelial cell damage and vascular toxicity. Endothelial dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of all known cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and closely related to the metabolic syndrome. Both CVD and diabetes contributes importantly to total mortality and to breast cancer (BC) specific mortality. In the epidemiological part of the project the investigators will determine the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity/mortality in early BC patients compared to the Danish background population. In the clinical part the investigators will study the changes of endothelial function and metabolic parameters in BC patients receiving chemotherapy. With increasing number of BC survivors long-term consequences of curative cancer treatment should be studied. The investigators hypothesize that cytotoxic therapy worsens metabolic parameters possibly through endothelial dysfunction. If this is true the next step will be to evaluate how strict metabolic control will affect prognosis.    ,NCT02652975

Breast Cancer,A Registry Study of Breast Microseed Treatment, For women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer lumpectomy followed by radiation is a common treatment option. Radiation treatment is typically delivered to the whole breast five times per week for anywhere from 3 to 8 weeks. The radiation helps kill any cancer cells that may have been left over following the surgery but causes skin burns. Many studies have demonstrated that radiation to the whole breast is not necessary that it can be delivered to a portion of the breast where the cancer is more likely to recur. A technique called a Permanent Breast Seed Implant (PBSI) involving the implantation of radioactive seeds has been developed to deliver the radiation to a portion of the breast. The procedure is performed on an out-patient basis under local anesthesia and light sedation. Because the radioactive seeds are permanently implanted in the breast the patient is able to live a normal life while the seeds deliver the prescribed radiation to the breast. Previous studies on PBSI demonstrate that it is a safe and effective alternative form of radiation for appropriately selected patients after lumpectomy. However those results have been obtained mainly from a single institution with only 4 patients treated in another center. Further research is still needed to evaluate its safety in a multi-center setting. The purpose of this study is to ensure the appropriate training of clinicians who will be performing this procedure and to capture long term outcomes and rare complications if any.    ,NCT02701244

Breast Cancer,Study of Cirmtuzumab and Paclitaxel for Metastatic or Locally Advanced Unresectable Breast Cancer, The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety of the investigational drug called cirmtuzumab in combination with the breast cancer drug paclitaxel. Cirmtuzumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. This drug is designed to attach to a protein called ROR1 that is on the surface of breast cancer cells. This blocks growth and survival of the breast cancer cells. ROR1 is rarely expressed on healthy cells so this drug should target the cancer cells. Cirmtuzumab is considered experimental because its use is not approved by United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although there is evidence from tests on laboratory animals that cirmtuzumab can decrease the number of breast cancer cells we do not know if this will work in humans. This drug has been tested in humans before but has never been tested in patients with breast cancer or in combination with paclitaxel in humans. Therefore the goal of this study is to see if cirmtuzumab is safe and tolerable when in given in combination with paclitaxel in study participants. You will be evaluated to find out what effects (good and bad) cirmtuzumab has on you and we would like to learn more about how cirmtuzumab might affect the growth of your cancer cells. We would also like to see how long the drug stays in your body and what affects the drug may have on your body.    ,NCT02776917

Breast Cancer,Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Oncological Surgery of Breast, Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in the female population Brazilian except non-melanoma skin tumors. Surgery plays an important role in regional spot disease control and the definition of parameters for the adjuvant treatment indication. Surgical site infections (SSI) are defined as wound infections occur following invasive procedures corresponding to 14-16% of all infections nosocomial in hospitalized patients the most common among patients surgical. SSIs should be examined as potential wound contamination surgical understood as the number of micro-organisms in the body and / or tissue being operated. Considering this aspect the cancer surgery breast are classified by their potential for contamination by clean. The use of antibiotics to prevent the SSI in mastectomies is not standardized in Handbook of National Health Surveillance Agency due to the effectiveness of undocumented prophylaxis Thus the use of antibiotics may vary among services.

Breast Cancer,Triple Negative Breast Cancer: Identification Pilot Study of Predictive Transcriptome Profiles of Early Tumor Drug Resistance Observed in 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, Breast cancer is a major public health problem. In France it is the leading cause of cancer death in women. According to the National Cancer Institute (INCA) approximately 49000 new cases were diagnosed in 2012 in France. It is an heterogeneous disease comprising a plurality of entities whose clinical behavior biological and prognosis differ. Amongst these entities the breast cancer triple negative (TN) is defined by the absence of expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone and the absence of overexpression of HER2 oncoprotein. It represents about 15% of breast cancers and occurs more frequently in young women. This is a very proliferative tumor phenotype with metastatic potential. Because of its genomic heterogeneity and lack of recurrent identified molecular target no targeted therapy has today shown benefit in terms of survival compared to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy which partly explains the very poor prognosis of this tumor phenotype. The positron emission tomography (PET) with 18Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) is a molecular imaging test that can identify from the first or second neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment non-responder patients to treatment with low probability of pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For this two FDG-PET examinations should be performed; a) a pretreatment PET b) a control PET after one or two treatments. The objective of this pilot single-center prospective study is a preliminary identification of recurrent genomic alterations among triple-negative tumors with early chemoresistance identified by PET in the first cycle of neoadjuvant therapy.    ,NCT02850302
Breast Cancer,Single Versus Multiple Injection Ultrasound Guided Paravertebral Blocks, Paravertebral block (PVB) has been shown to provide excellent analgesia for major breast surgeries resulting in reduced narcotic consumption reduced nausea improved quality of recovery reduced chronic pain and possibly reduced metastasis with breast cancer. Traditionally PVB is done by multiple injections below T1-T5 transverse processes. With multiple injections the risk is increased for a pleural an intraneural and/or an intravascular injection. Recently ultrasonography is being used to facilitate PVB. The use of ultrasound imaging enables real-time needle visualization during the procedure. This may improve efficacy and reduce the chances of complication like pneumothorax. Currently there are no data comparing ultrasound-guided single injection technique with multiple injections technique with regards to extent of spread for PVB. Our objective is to investigate the extent of dermatomal spread of PVB when equal volumes of local anesthetic are injected at one versus five paravertebral sites for patients undergoing major breast surgery. In addition the investigators wish to compare the performance time and duration of analgesia. Methodology: After local REB approval 72 patients undergoing a unilateral mastectomy with or without axillary node dissection will be randomized to receive either single or multiple injections PVB. The PVB will be performed in prone position under real-time ultrasound guidance using a para-sagittal approach.The patients in single injection group will receive single injection PVB at T3-T4 level with 25 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine and four subcutaneous sham injections. Patients in the multiple injection group will receive five injections of PVB from T1 to T5 level. 5 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine will be injected at each level. Pleural drift will be used as a sign of correct needle tip location and local anaesthetic spread. The pinprick method will be used to assess the extent of dermatomal blockade 20 minutes following the completion of procedure. All patients will receive a standardized general anesthesia for the surgery. Any adverse events including pneumothorax epidural spread LA toxicity/seizure total spinal will be recorded.    ,NCT02852421

Breast Cancer,Reader Study for Image Quality of Cone Beam Breast CT System, Koning Breast CT (KBCT) was approved by FDA PMA. The X-ray detector originally used in Koning Breast CT was PaxScan 4030CB. Recently Koning Breast CT uses a modified X-ray detector PaxScan 4030MCT. The modified detector is essentially identical to the previous model except a different detector housing which allows a narrower dead-space between the active area and the top of the housing. The benefit of the modified detector is that it allows Koning to modify the patient exam table achieving a flatter surface in the center. The flatter surface will increase patient comfort and improve workflow. Meanwhile flatter surface may also affect patient positioning and the coverage of the breast. The adequacy of the overall image quality with the new table/detector should be verified by radiologists.    ,NCT02864667
Breast Cancer,Behavioral Symptom Management Program for Breast Cancer in Singapore and The US, Research indicates that up to two-thirds of patients with advanced cancer experience significant symptom burden (e.g. anxiety and depression pain fatigue) yet these symptoms are not adequately addressed. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols designed to teach patients strategies to increase their sense of self-efficacy to manage symptoms may be helpful in alleviating multiple cancer-related symptoms. The efficacy of CBT protocols for reducing distinct symptoms in early-stage breast cancer has been shown; however the role of CBT protocols for multiple symptoms in late-stage cancer is less clear. The current study aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability as well as obtain an initial estimate of efficacy of a novel cross-cultural CBT intervention that addresses multiple symptoms in advanced breast cancer patients. The target outcomes of intervention will be reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression pain and fatigue. A randomized controlled design will compare patients receiving a CBT protocol to a waitlist control in both Singapore and US patients. The larger goal of this collaborative effort is to determine the scalability of such an intervention that can potentially provide needed symptom burden relief to advanced cancer patients.    ,NCT02865148

Breast Cancer,PREgnancy and FERtility Registry, The PREgnancy and FERtility (PREFER) study is a comprehensive program aiming to optimize care and improve knowledge around the topics of fertility preservation and pregnancy issues in young breast cancer patients. The program was initiated at the National Institute for Cancer Research IRCCS AOU San Martino - IST in Genova (Liguria Region Italy) and then it has been spread to other Italian Institutions under the umbrella of the Gruppo Italiano Mammella (GIM) study group. It is composed of two distinctive studies one assessing fertility (i.e. PREFER-FERTILITY) and the other pregnancy (PREFER-PREGNANCY) issues. Hence two different study protocols were developed under the umbrella of the PREFER registry. PREFER-FERTILITY aims to obtain and centralize data about the preferences and choices of young cancer patients on the fertility preservation strategies available in Italy.

Breast Cancer,Delphinus SoftVue Prospective Case Collection - ARM 2, The SoftVue??is a whole breast ultrasound system with an automated scanning curvilinear ring?array transducer that employs UST. It is currently cleared under FDA 510(k) K123209 and K142517 for use as both a B?mode ultrasonic breast imaging system and color imaging of transmission data (sound speed and attenuation). SoftVue??is not intended to be used as a replacement for screening mammography. SoftVue uses non?ionizing ultrasound energy to generate tomographic image volumes of the whole breast. While the patient lays prone on a padded table with one breast comfortably submerged in a bath of warm water a ring?shaped transducer 22 cm in diameter encircles the breast and pulses low?frequency sound waves through the water and into the breast tissue. More than 2000 elements in the curvilinear transducer's 360 degree array emit and receive ultrasound signals to analyze echoes from the breast anatomy in all directions from the chest wall to the nipple. Not only does SoftVue capture data from the reflection of the sound waves off of tissue boundaries and structures within the breast but because the transducer surrounds the whole breast SoftVue also captures signals that are transmitted through the breast. This additional transmission data enhances the visualization of the anatomic structure of the breast tissue and is not currently available in any other commercially marketed breast ultrasound device. This prospective multicenter multi?arm clinical case collection program is IRB?approved and will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable regulatory requirements. Arm 2 aims to collectively enroll up to 1000 women at a total of up to 8 clinical sites. The design of Arm 2 in this protocol is strictly limited to case collection and is non-interventional; any investigational and/or statistical plans for future analyses will be prepared and registered separately if they are applicable to the requirements of FDAAA 801. Arm 2 is limited to the cohort of diagnostic female patients of any breast density composition category who have been recommended for a breast biopsy (BI-RADS 4 or 5) after diagnostic imaging or who have confirmed imaging findings. Matched sets of diagnostic imaging and SV exams from the same patient demographic information and clinical outcome data will be collected during diagnostic workup. Ultrasound characteristics for all types of lesions whether they are benign or malignant will be collected as well as objective and subjective breast density composition data. Ultrasound image data may be acquired with modified SoftVue devices which have passed safety and quality evaluations per Delphinus' quality management system (QMS) and satisfy design change control standards at select clinical sites in accordance with 21 CFR 812.2 (b) as a routine part of feasibility validation and verification testing for engineering and product development purposes. The exams and clinical data accumulated in this prospective case collection (PCC) protocol will populate a database from which future investigations may be designed for peer reviewed publication development of user training curricula building teaching case and creating new marketing materials for SoftVue.    ,NCT02977247

Breast Cancer,Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy in Breast Cancer, Thermotherapy is a technology aiming at destroying tissue for example tumor tissue. Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy (imILT) is a specific form of thermotherapy which in addition to destroying tumor tissue has been optimized to cause a tumor specific immunologic response. In laboratory animals the imILT method has also been shown to induce a so called abscopal effect. This means that when one tumor is treated with imILT other untreated tumors also decrease in size. The immunologic response has previously been characterized in breast cancer patients after receiving imILT treatment  and presumed abscopal effects induced by imILT have also been described in a malignant melanoma patient. The purpose of this trial is to investigate the functionality and safety of the imILT treatment method in patients diagnosed with breast cancer. The treatment method has successfully been used for treatment of patients with breast cancer and malignant melanoma. Treatment of breast cancer patients caused an increase of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the treated tumor as well as activated dendritic cells at the tumor border. Regulatory T lymphocytes decreased in the regional lymph nodes. This trial is explorative prospective open and non-randomized. Five breast cancer patients will be treated in this trial which is estimated to be carried out during a time period of 9 months.    ,NCT03039127

Breast Cancer,Lapatinib or Trastuzumab Given Prior to Surgery With Chemotherapy in Patients With Early Breast Cancer, This study will test the safety of a drug called lapatinib and how well it works. Lapatinib (also called Tyverb or Tykerb) will be compared with another drug trastuzumab (also called Herceptin). Trastuzumab is an antibody against the HER2 protein. It binds to part of the HER2 protein to stop it working. Clinical trials have found that adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy lowers the rate of cancer recurrence and improves survival in women with HER2 positive breast cancer. Lapatinib also stops the HER2 protein working and may slow or stop cancer cells from growing and may prevent cancer from returning. Lapatinib has been approved in some countries to treat patients with certain types of breast cancer. However lapatinib has not been approved to treat early breast cancer. This study is one of many being carried out involving lapatinib in early breast cancer and these studies are showing that it is a promising treatment. This study will compare lapatinib and trastuzumab. One group of people will take lapatinib and another group will take trastuzumab. The effects of the drugs both good and bad will be compared. This study will compare two different durations of HER2 treatment to see if earlier introduction of HER2 treatment is beneficial. The lapatinib group will receive HER2 treatment from the very beginning for 24 weeks prior to surgery and the trastuzumab group will only receive HER2 therapy for 12 weeks prior to surgery.    ,NCT01205217

Breast Cancer,Treatment Options in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients, This study will describe the treatment paradigm used over recent years in the clinical management of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)+ metastatic breast cancer in Hungary. This information will provide insight into real-world exposure and adherence to anti-HER2 therapy containing regimens and improve understanding of the reasons for discontinuation of this therapy. This is a retrospective descriptive cohort study of approximately 180 female patients diagnosed with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in Hungary. Patients diagnosed with or who progressed to metastatic disease between 01 September 2009 and 01 September 2010 will be included. All patients will be followed until death loss to follow-up or the end of the study period (30 September 2012). All data will be collected retrospectively from patient medical records. Descriptive statistics of the demographic and clinical characteristics of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer patients including sites of metastases the time from initial breast cancer diagnosis until diagnosis of metastatic disease and HER2 testing methodology and status of HER2 will be described. Further descriptive statistics of the proportion of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer patients who received anti-HER2 therapy the sequencing of different therapies and the duration of therapies in the metastatic setting will be analysed. Among the subset of women who receive lapatinib plus capecitabine descriptive statistics of the timing of initiation of lapatinib plus capecitabine in the metastatic treatment pathway time to treatment discontinuation and time to progression (TTP) on lapatinib plus capecitabine will be calculated.

Breast Cancer,Safety Study of Cancer Stem Cell Vaccinie to Treat Breast Cancer, Most studies of cancer stem cells (CSC) involve the inoculation of cells from human tumors into immunosuppressed mice preventing an assessment on the immunologic interactions and effects of CSCs. In this study the investigators examined the vaccination effects produced by CSC-enriched populations from histologically distinctmurine tumors after their inoculation into different syngeneic immunocompetent hosts. Enriched CSCs were immunogenic and more effective as an antigen source than unselected tumor cells in inducing protective antitumor immunity.Immune sera from CSC-vaccinated hosts contained high levels of IgG which bound to CSCs resulting in CSC lysis in the presence of complement.CTLs generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or splenocytes harvested from CSC-vaccinated hosts were capable of killing CSCs in vitro. Mechanistic investigations established that CSC-primed antibodies and T cells were capable of selective targeting CSCs and conferring antitumor immunity.    ,NCT02063893
Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Biomarkers Associated With Response to Subsequent Therapies in Subjects With HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, This is a multicenter open-label Phase II study in subjects with Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer who received at least 2 prior lines of anti-HER2-targeted therapies of which at least one included a Trastuzumab-containing regimen. This study is a post-approval commitment with regulatory authorities. It is designed with the primary endpoint to evaluate the changes in biomarkers associated with HER family immunomodulation apoptosis and Adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporters between the pre-treatment and disease progression biopsy. It is hypothesized that these changes in biomarkers may modulate resistance mechanisms and thereby alters the response to subsequent chemotherapy based regimens. Therefore in addition to the description of the clinical outcome of Overall response rate Clinical benefit rate Progression-free survival and Overall survival for each arm Progression-free survival on next-line therapies will be collected and summarized for each arm. All subjects will receive study treatment until disease progression unacceptable toxicity or subject withdrawal and after which will be followed for subsequent anticancer therapy and disease progression events and survival. The primary endpoint of the study will be to evaluate changes in expression of biomarkers associated with the HER family or receptors and ligands immunomodulation apoptosis and ABC transports between a pre-treatment biopsy and the disease progression biopsy. This study will evaluate potential mechanisms to explore the antitumor activity of dual blockade and will provide a descriptive clinical outcome for subjects treated with Trastuzumab in combination with Lapatinib or chemotherapy. No formal comparisons between treatment arms will be undertaken.    ,NCT02213042

Breast Cancer,Analysis of Prognostic and Predictive Genomic Signatures Using Archival Paraffin-embedded Breast Tumor - a Pilot Study, A number of prognostic and/or predictive genomic signatures for breast cancer have been developed by Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS). In the past 1 year GIS has developed protocols and methods to conduct expression assays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens. A study on 800 tumor samples is planned to analyze these gene signatures and compare them with conventional clinical prognosticators and predictors. As the investigators plan to use archival tumor samples that dates back to the 1990s the aim of this pilot study is to first analyze 10 anonymized samples to determine the feasibility of running these assays on old archival blocks. The information generated will help us determine whether very old samples (diagnosed before 2000) may be selected for the actual study.    ,NCT01247467
Breast Cancer,Analysis of Prognostic and Predictive Genomic Signatures Using Archival Paraffin-embedded Tumor Specimens in Breast Cancer," Major Aims of study:   1. To create a gene expression-based prognostic device that complements or exceeds the prognostic utility of conventional biomarkers of breast cancer outcome.   2. To identify one or more clinical subgroups of patients for which the prognostic device outperforms or substantially adds to the prognostic performance of conventional markers that currently determine therapeutic strategies. Sub-Aims of study:   1. Assess the prognostic value of the multiple gene expression signatures alone and in combination using a large cohort of breast cancer patients for which pathology treatment and outcome is available. A ""training"" and ""testing"" design is proposed.   2. Evaluate the utility of a prognostic device that measures gene expression levels from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens (FFPEs) of primary resected tumors. The investigators will utilize the Affymetrix Quantigene 2.0 Assay and/or the Illumina BeadXpress VeraCode DASL Gene Expression Assay (FDA-approved IVDMIA.)   3. For specific clinical subgroups of patients/tumors the investigators will mathematically identify additive or synergistic prognostic relationships between genes and gene signatures that in combination will yield maximal risk prediction (distant metastases-free survival) for patients.   4. Compare the prognostic utility of the investigators device to that of the conventional prognostic variables that are currently used to determine therapeutic strategy.   5. Incorporate the prognostic signatures into a practical prognosis algorithm that seeks to include conventional measures of outcome such as tumor size histologic grade nodal status patient age or Nottingham index etc. The investigators hypothesize that adequate quality and quantity of tumor RNA may be extracted from archival paraffin-embedded tumor specimens for gene expression profiling and that archival tumor-derived genomic signatures may be used as prognosticators or predictors in breast cancer.

This study will also help us understand the biological reason for how DOSI works.    ,NCT02725658
Breast Cancer,Chemotherapy on Methylation Patterns in Breast Tumor Tissue Correlating With Clinical Response and Outcomes, Primary Objectives   1. To identify hypermethylated genes in paired pretreatment breast tumor tissue and plasma samples from locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer patients using a known gene panel which includes APC1 Cyclin D2 RARB RASSF1A Twist Hin1 and GSTP1. Rationale: We and others have determined the optimal panel of genes that are able to detect free DNA in plasma and serum. We will determine if the same panel of genes is effective for detecting tumor DNA in the plasma of locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer patients. Further to determine if the methylation profile of the plasma DNA for these genes is the same or different from the primary tumor at presentation we will analyze the primary tumor DNA from fresh frozen samples.   2. To identify methylation pattern changes in the same subset of patients' plasma samples at 24 hours after completion of cycle 1 of chemotherapy and within 24 hours before cycle 2. Rationale: The optimal timing of sampling for methylation analysis that is reflective of the tumors response to chemotherapy is not known. How soon methylation changes are observed whether they are high within 24 hours as that tumor responds to chemotherapy or whether changes can be observed only some time after one cycle of chemotherapy will be studied. (3) To also identify methylation pattern changes in breast tumor tissue after one cycle of chemotherapy. Rationale: To look for a correlation with plasma methylation patterns Secondary Objectives (1) To correlate our observed patterns of methylation pre- and post-treatment with clinical parameters such as clinical and/or radiological response and patient outcome.    ,NCT00698477
Breast Cancer,A Pilot Study Evaluation of the Efficacy of SonoVue to Detect and Characterise Breast Lesions, Ultrasound is a well-established imaging modality for the evaluation of breast disease. The investigators' objective is to characterise the properties of an intravascular ultrasonographic contrast agent SonoVue (sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles) to improve the diagnostic value of the ultrasound examination in patients with different breast lesions. The final purpose of this ultrasonography is to allow the early detection of tumors and to improve the differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. SonoVueÂ® (sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles) is a microbubbles preparation that is stable resistant to pressure and specifically designed to be used as a contrast agent for ultrasound imaging. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound could provide a non-invasive technique to evaluate the morphology of breast tumour vascularity.    ,NCT00243698
Breast Cancer,Evaluate the Use of the Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Determining if the Breast Tumor is Benign or Malignant, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a novel imaging technique for noninvasive probing of biochemical properties of tissue. While MRS does not generate images of tumor per se it allows biochemical spectroscopic data to be obtained in vivo from user defined region-of-interest. In this manner biochemical information elucidated by MRS can be interpreted in relation to detailed anatomy and images of metabolite distribution can be created. The aim of MRS is to identify presence and concentration of metabolites characteristic for normal and abnormal (tumor) cellular activities hence allow differential normal tissue from pathological tissue as well as allow differentiating malignant from benign tumors.    ,NCT00639171
Breast Cancer,Biomarker Study of Breast Tumors, This protocol aims to create a tissue bank of breast tumors obtained at the time of diagnosis for the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis prognostication and prediction of treatment response in breast cancer. While tissue banks now exist in major hospitals in Singapore to collect tumor specimens at the time of surgery specimens collected at surgery from patients who had undergone pre-operative treatment represent a post-treatment sample and not a baseline untreated sample. Such samples are intrinsically different from untreated samples and have to be analyzed separately from untreated samples. However they remain valuable samples particularly if a pre-treatment sample has been obtained providing paired pre- and post-treatment samples which could provide valuable information on treatment-related tumor biomarker changes. A tissue bank comprising of samples collected during the diagnostic core biopsy thus represents a valuable supplement to existing tissue banks. Approximately 10-20% of patients diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer will require neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition future clinical trials may include 'window-of-opportunity' studies during which biological therapy is administered for a short period (2-3 weeks) while an operable breast cancer patient is awaiting definitive surgery. The majority of early-stage breast cancer patients would be eligible for such trials allowing the rapid recruitment of breast cancer patients. When coupled with analysis of surrogate markers of response (eg apoptosis anti-angiogenic effects etc) these unique clinical trials could provide valuable insights into the biological effects of new therapeutic agents in evaluation.    ,NCT00941408
Breast Cancer,Levobupivacaine and Lidocaine for Paravertebral Block Causes Greater Hemodynamic Oscillations Than Levobupivacaine, The purpose and the goal of this paper is to show whether the application of a combination of two local anesthetics as opposed to the application of one local anesthetic at paravertebral block changes the hemodynamic variable. It is therefore a prospective randomized double- blind study where we do a clinical trial in patients ASA(American Society of Anesthesiologists) 1 and 2 statuses between 18 and 80 years of age using the ultrasound in plane technology.Upon arrival of patients in the unit for preparation procedures for anesthesia we set the ECG(electrocardiograph) noninvasive blood pressure oxygen saturation and arterial cannula in the radial artery After sterile washing of the dorsal surface paravertebral space was identified with ultrasound using 8 Hz(hertz) linear transducer probe then needle position was confirmed with neurostimulation at the level of 2.0 - 5.0 mA(milliampere). When muscle contraction persisted at 0.4mA(milliampere) the anesthetic was applied in levels of Th 2 Th3 and Th 4 (70 milliliters per level). We applied the 0.5 % levobupivacaine and 2 % lidocaine 70 milliliters of mixture per level in one group while only 0.5 % levobupivacaine also 70 milliliters. by level in the second one. After that the invasive hemodynamic monitoring was placed on patients and the induction with 1 % propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg.and Vecuronium 008 mg/kg. was performed with the application of supraglottic airway gel of appropriate size. The maintenance of anesthesia and sedation will be conducted with Propofol 1 % continuously ( 25-150 mcg / kg / min.)The measurements will be taken every 5 minutes during the first hour of the application of paravertebral block then every 15 minutes during the second hour and if the operation takes more than two hours the measurements are performed every 30 minutes. Postoperatively invasive hemodynamic monitoring will be removed in post-anesthesia recovery room together with the arterial cannula and the patient will be sent to the hospital ward with non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring (blood pressure pulse saturation) until the termination of the blocks.Statistical methods By comparing two target groups we analysed the strength of the test with following assumptions: X2 difference test the expected difference in variances in stroke volume between groups of 60% Î± significance level of 0.05 and the minimum statistical test strength of 85%. The required total sample should include at least 80 patients that is 40 per group.Data will be presented in tables and graphs. Descriptive statistics of examined variables with appropriate measures of central tendency will be made. Smirnov -Kolmogorov test will assess the normality of data distribution. According to the received results the appropriate parametric and / or nonparametric tests will be used. Comparisons of quantitative values between the two groups will be analyzed using the independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Dependent values within each group will be analyzed using analysis of variance for repeated measures or Friedman test. Differences in categorical values will be analyzed by X2 test. The appropriate regression model will be made in order to predict the variability of stroke volume in which the dependent variable will be a variation of the stroke volume while relevant clinical values will be taken as predictor variables. All P values smaller than 0.05 will be considered significant. This research is to present the main results - the existence of the significant change in Stroke Volume Variation (SVV) between groups using invasive hemodynamic monitoring the changes of Stroke Volume Variation(SVV) depending on the time from the application within groups differences in volume compensation of crystalloids and colloids and the need for the application of vasoactive drugs. Furthermore as a secondary results we will present the time to maximal block development the duration of post operative analgesia patient satisfaction and time needed for the full recovery from the block.    ,NCT02004834

Breast Cancer,The Symphony Triple A Study: Using Symphony in Treatment Decisions Concerning Adjuvant Systemic Therapy, Rationale: Prediction of prognosis in patients with breast cancer is important to determine the indication for adjuvant chemo- endocrine- and immunotherapy. Apart from the clinicopathological parameters incorporated into the Adjuvant!Online predictive model the validated 70-gene signature MammaPrintÂ® is predictive of outcome too. MammaPrintÂ® is advised in the current Dutch CBO guideline (2012) for hormone receptor positive invasive ductal breast cancer in individual cases when there is 'doubt' about the indication for adjuvant chemotherapy based on traditional prognostic factors. In the present study MammaPrintÂ® is used in this CBO 2012 guideline defined group of patients as an additional test for decision-making for adjuvant chemotherapy. Objective: To assess the impact of MammaPrintÂ® on clinical decision making regarding the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy in the CBO 2012 guideline defined group of hormone receptor positive invasive ductal carcinoma patients when there is doubt about the indication for adjuvant chemotherapy based on traditional prognostic factors. The influence of various factors and the impact of MammaPrintÂ® in predefined subgroups will be analyzed too. Data from a national registry regarding adjuvant systemic treatment in patients with similar clinicopathological characteristics in whom MammaPrintÂ® was not used will be obtained to provide a control group. Hypothesis: In the group of patients where national guidelines advocate using systemic therapy but doctors are ambivalent in treating patients with adjuvant chemotherapy it is hypothesized that using MammaPrintÂ® as an additional test will change the indication for adjuvant therapy in a substantial proportion of patients resulting in at least 10% less patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus in the study group at least 10% less patients will receive chemotherapy when compared to a contemporary group of patients with similar clinicopathological characteristics but without using MammaPrintÂ® Study population: Hormone receptor positive invasive ductal breast cancer patients when there is doubt about the indication for adjuvant chemotherapy based on traditional prognostic factors. Study design: This is a prospective multicentre impact study.    ,NCT02209857

Breast Cancer,Trial Evaluating Role of Post Mastectomy Radiotherapy in Women With Node Negative Early Breast Cancer," Postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) is unequivocally beneficial in reducing the recurrences as well as improving survival in node positive breast cancer patients. PMRT for women with T1-T2 tumors and negative axillary nodes is not generally warranted because of the presumed low risk of recurrence in this population as a whole. However in the setting of multiple adverse prognostic factors the recurrence risk approaches and in some cases surpasses the risk of recurrence documented for patients with one to three positive lymph nodes. Numerous retrospective series have reported the outcome and patterns of failure for post-mastectomy patients treated without radiation. Many of these series have analyzed several high risk factors which were predictive of loco-regional recurrence wherein the role of adjuvant post-mastectomy radiation can be considered. Some authors have used combinations of prognostic factors such as age tumour size grade receptor status Her2neu status and lympho-vascular space invasion to define subgroups with more specific risks of loco-regional recurrence than single factors alone. The current trial hypothesizes that ""Post-mastectomy radiation in high risk node negative early breast cancer patients decreases rates of loco-regional recurrence and improves disease free survival"" and propose to address the question in randomized setting.

Breast Cancer,Axillary Reverse Mapping Using Near-infrared Imaging in Invasive Breast Cancer: Predictors of Nodal Positivity, The initial standard treatment of breast cancer is surgery. Tumor involvement of lymph nodes is of paramount importance in the subsequent management of this cancer and surgery of invasive breast cancer involves axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). To preserve arm lymphatic drainage during ALND and avoid the risk of arm lymphedema mapping the lymphatic drainage by axillary reverse mapping (ARM) has been developed. But oncological safety is uncertain. The ARM procedure presented here uses indocyanine green (ICG) and fluorescence detection of draining lymphatics. The project aims to train surgeons to the technique and to identify predictive factors for metastatic ARM nodes in invasive BC using tumor and axillary pathological parameters to better select patients who would not require removal of the ARM node in the future    ,NCT02994225

In a recently published study discontinuation of statin therapy in patients after acute myocardial infarction was associated with a higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 345) and a higher cardiac mortality (hazard ratio 465). Increasing evidence suggests that statins also have vasoactive properties by up-regulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with positive effects on endothelial function. Experiments with flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) showed these positive effects of statin treatment on endothelial function but also revealed that withdrawal of statin treatment transiently worsens endothelial function independently of serum cholesterol levels. Consequently this placebo controlled Phase IV crossover study wants to assess changes of endothelial function in terms of flicker induced vasodilatation before and during statin therapy as well as after statin withdrawal. For this purpose 20 healthy subjects will be treated with 40 mg/day of simvastatin for a period of 4 weeks. Flicker induced vasodilatation and retinal oxygen saturation will be measured with the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer system by Imedos at baseline in the 4th week of simvastatin or placebo intake as well as 3 7 and 14 days after the end of intake.    ,NCT02533141
Healthy,Fructose and Ethnic Differences Study (FED Study), In the UK people of black West African and Caribbean's tend to have healthier blood cholesterol and blood fat levels as well as lower incidence of heart disease/heart attack. But rates of heart disease are now rising in young African-American populations with diabetes for the first time exceeding the rate in their white European-American peers. One possible culprit is the increasing consumption of fructose which can lead to high blood fat levels. Fructose is a natural sugar found in fruits and table sugar but is also used the food industry as an ingredient and sweetener. Because fructose intakes are lower in the UK than in North America we are studying the effect of fructose intake in UK black West African and Caribbean people to understand if fructose intake is indeed a reason for these ethnic differences.    ,NCT02533817
Healthy,Effects of Berry Peel Intake on Glucose Metabolism in Healthy Subjects, The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a 4-weeks intake of berry peel powder on fasting and postprandial glucose metabolism and inflammatory markers. The berry peel product will be compared with a placebo in a single-blind cross-over design. Furthermore inflammation-related peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) genes expression appetite and cognitive performance will be included as a pilot study.

Healthy,"Comparative Evaluation of the Effect on Blood Pressure of an Equivalent Content of Sodium in the Form of Bicarbonate of Sodium and in the Form of Sodium Chloride on ""Sensitive Sodium"" Subjects"," Many large-scale epidemiological studies have established a link between the average consumption of table salt (sodium chloride) and blood pressure. In France a survey conducted in 2001 showed that the average consumption of salt is 9 to 10g per people / day and health authorities considered it appropriate to reduce consumption about 20% by limiting contributions of sodium in prepared foods bread. In terms of basic and clinical research the biological effects of sodium chloride dietary intake have been the subject of numerous studies for several decades. This work showed that all subjects do not react uniformly to sodium chloride flows determining what the investigators call people ""sodium-sensitive"". For these people the sodium intake elevated blood pressure much more marked than in subjects called ""sodium-resistant."" ""Sodium-sensitive"" people represent 10 to 30% of the population. A marked over-representation of this phenotype was observed in patients with hypertension or a family history of hypertension. In addition studies conducted in animals and humans indicate that sodium intake has a different impact on biological parameters mentioned above as is done in the form of chloride salt or bicarbonate of sodium. Based on these factors investigators developed a clinical trial protocol intended to highlight a possible differential effect in the biological effects of the same sodium intake (2.56 g / day) orally depending on the nature salt.

Healthy,Can Correction of Low Vitamin D Status in Infancy Program for a Leaner Body Composition?, One in four infants are born with low amounts of vitamin D stored in their body. This study is designed to test whether improving vitamin D status quickly after birth helps infants to build muscle and to normalize growth. This is important since the investigators have noticed in previous work that infants with low vitamin D have higher body weight relative to body length later on and that those who develop very good stores quickly have a leaner body type. Therefore in this study infants with low stores early after birth will be given either the regular amount of supplementation or a higher amount to more rapidly build up the vitamin stores in the body. Infants in both groups will be measured for muscle and fat mass at standardized ages during the first year of life and into the toddler years. The information will inform health care professionals and parents of the importance of establishing good vitamin D stores early in life. Vitamin D supplementation is a modifiable factor that is already recommended for all term born infants. Knowing how much is needed in infants born with low stores has not been tested in a controlled manner in Canada.    ,NCT02563015

To minimize delays and error the investigators recently published a resuscitation handbook who provides drug dosages for each weight for children thus eliminating the need for dosage calculation. Once the weight of the patient is known the physicians only have to open the book at the page corresponding to the weight and all the medications with their calculated dosage are provided. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the number of dosage error during simulated pediatric resuscitation comparing residents using the handbook vs. utilisation of a chart providing non-calculated dosage. This will be an experimental crossover trial among 40 residents performing four simulated case-scenarios in a high-fidelity simulation lab.    ,NCT02563912

Healthy,Human Fine-motor-skills in Weightlessness: Comparison of a Laboratory and an Everyday-like Context, The human performance during weightlessness was tested in a multiplicity of laboratory experiments during parabolic flights and in space. It is therefore known that human fine motor skills as grasping are affected by the impact of changing gravity levels. However because everyday life movements differ in several aspects from those done in an experimental lab situation investigators do not know until know if this kind of movements is altered in the same extend. Fine motor skills seem to depend on the context in which they are made. Thus the performance in weightlessness during everyday life could substantially differ from the results given by previous laboratory studies. This assumption will be tested in the present project with subjects executing one and the same grasping movement in two different contexts both in normal gravity conditions and in weightlessness. To that end the investigators developed a new method which allows comparing the same grasping movements under different conditions.    ,NCT02566213

Healthy,Health Beneficial Effects of Krill Oil and Lean and Fatty Fish, Intake of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from fish oil and fish are associated with significant health benefits in risk of cardiovascular disease. However both lean and fatty fish have been shown to have beneficial effects suggesting that not all effects are mediated by n-3 PUFAs. Krill oil is an n-3 PUFA supplement on the marked. The n-3 PUFAs from krill oil is in the form of phospholipids and these fatty acids may be more readily and effectively absorbed after ingestion than n-3 PUFAs in the form of triacylglycerols from fish oil. Fish also contain many other potential health components than n-3 PUFAs such as taurine and vitamin D iodine selenium and more unspecified components such as bioactive peptides which can mediate the health beneficial effects observed after intake of fish. The present study aims to elucidate the cardiovascular health beneficial effects after consumption of fish (lean and fatty) and krill oil with regard to effects on plasma lipids and other markers of cardiovascular health such as inflammatory haemostatic and endothelial dysfunction markers. The investigators will perform whole genome transcriptome analyses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in order to further understand the cardiovascular health benefits and elucidate the mechanisms of action.    ,NCT02568228

Healthy,Laser Speckle Flowgraphy in Caucasians: Age Dependence and Comparison With Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography, Some of the most prevalent eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are associated with ocular perfusion abnormalities. Currently there is no gold-standard method for the measurement of ocular blood flow available. Laser speckle flowgraphy is a promising technique for the two-dimensional assessment of ocular blood flow in humans. So far the technique has however been only gained widespread use in Japan. The experience in Caucasian subjects is very limited. In a Japanese population it was shown that mean blur rate a measure of chorioretinal blood velocity decreases with age. This is of relevance because an age-related decline in ocular blood flow may partially explain the age-dependence of ocular vascular disease. The present study investigates this age-dependence in healthy subjects. In addition the investigators investigate in a sub-group of this population whether relative flow volume (RFV) a novel index of blood flow in the human retina derived from laser speckle flowgraphy is associated with retinal blood flow as assessed with bi-directional Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography (DOCT).    ,NCT02582411
Healthy,Effect of Pharmacological Heart Rate Reduction on Visco-elastic Properties of the Arterial Wall (BRADYVASC), The conduit arteries exhibit a viscoelastic behavior. Visco-elasticity is partially regulated by endothelium and contributes to the optimization of the heart-vessel coupling. Aging or high resting heart rate (HR) could alter visco-elastic properties leading to increase stiffness of the conduit arteries an independent cardiovascular risk factor and degradation of heart-vessel coupling. Lowering HR with ivabradine could reduce these effects. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of HR reduction by repeated administration of ivabradine on visco-elastic properties vascular geometry and function of common carotid artery and on cardiovascular hemodynamic in healthy subject. The influence of aging on ivabradine effects are studied too. 30 healthy volunteers aged between 25 and 65 years old with a HR ??70 bpm will receive ivabradine or placebo during 8 days in a single center randomized cross-group double blinded placebo-controlled study. Each period of treatment will be separate by 12 to 16 days of wash-out.

Healthy,Effects of Co-ingesting a Low/High GI Meal With Different Fat Saturation on Postprandial Glucose Insulin and Triacylglycerol Responses in Healthy Participants, It is now recognized that diet plays a critical role in the etiology and management of the chronic diseases such as diabetes obesity and cardiovascular disease. A high consumption of fat especially saturated fat is an established risk factor for Cardiovascular Disease.The glycaemic index (GI) is a measurement of the ability of different types of carbohydrate-based foods to raise blood glucose. The interest in low GI food as a weight management tool has been increasing. Different types of carbohydrates differ in their ability to increase postprandial blood glucose and insulin secretion and may also modulate the effect of different fatty acids. The current study will compare the consumption of low and high GI carbohydrate with different fat saturation on postprandial glucose insulin and triacylglycerol responses in healthy participants. The data generated will have direct applications in public health policy and clinical nutrition management of chronic disease. The outcomes of the study will significantly contribute to the long term national goals of Singapore to manage and to reduce the incidence of chronic disease associated with the metabolic syndrome.    ,NCT02585427

Healthy,Pedal Rate Influence on Oxygen Consumption in Eccentric, Nowadays ECC exercise can be realized using various modalities that target small or large muscle masses in a segmentary or dynamic way. The training program proposed in this study is realised on an handmade ergocycle which allows eccentric contractions. With this type of ergometer O2 consumption (VO2) is three to five fold lower than during an exercise realised at the same power output with a concentric ergocycle. Due to this later propertie which origins are not yet fully identified there is an increasing interest to embed ECC in rehabilitation programs. The investigators hypothesis that a higher pedal rate will induce a lower oxygen consumption with the same benefits. This study aims to compare oxygen consumption at two pedal rates : 50 and 80 rotation per minute (rpm). The ultimate goal is to assess efficacy and tolerance of eccentric training on ergocycle and to enhance comprehension of the physiological mecanisms involved in the lower O2 consumption observed.    ,NCT02594657

Healthy,13C Trioctanoate Breath Test as a Measurement of Gastric Fat Volume Emptying, 13C breath tests represent an attractive alternative in the measurement of gastric emptying (GE). Therefore these tests have been used in a variety of clinical settings such as in the assessment of gastroparesis delayed GE in diabetic patients or in the assessment of GE with fat containing enteral formulas in critically ill patients. The investigators have previously demonstrated that the 13C sodium octanoate breath test (OBT) is an inappropriate measurement method for the GE of fat. The OBT appears to be affected by 1) post gastric processing of the OCC marker and 2) its interaction with the physical form and concentration of the fat present in the stomach and duodenum. The13C trioctanoate breath test (TriOBT) represents an attractive alternative to the OBT. Compared to OCC which is a medium chain fatty acid the 13C trioctanoate (TriOCC) is a triglyceride. TriOCC has similar physio chemical properties as the nutritional lipid e.g. rapeseed oil. This study aims to assess the efficacy of the TriOBT as a GE measurement method of fat in an acid stable lipid emulsion (LE1). The breath test results from the TriOBT will be compared with the OBT and further validated against gastric fat volume emptying data observed from MRI. The interim analysis will determine whether the study will proceed to stage 2 which will assess the efficacy of the TriOBT in an acid unstable lipid emulsion (LE4).    ,NCT02602158

Healthy,Hydrocolloids as Functional Food Ingredients for Gut Health, Seaweeds are a natural source of nutrients and dependent on the variety are rich in dietary fibre proteins essential vitamins and minerals. However this resource is highly underexploited. Countries such as Japan China North and South Korea are large consumers of edible seaweed while exposure in Western countries is much lower and mainly as industrially extracted seaweed derivatives a common additive in many food and healthcare products. Seaweeds have been associated with a number of human gut promoting health benefits such as decreasing faecal transit time through the gastrointestinal tract thus preventing constipation and resulting in a reduced exposure to harmful substances (decreasing colon cancer risk). These health benefits can be attributed to seaweeds high dietary fibre content. Interestingly the food and healthcare industry already utilize seaweed-extracted fibre in the manufacturing process thus steering the way forward towards the development of novel functional food products. These seaweed-extracted fibres are high molecular weight polysaccharides known as hydrocolloids and are non-digestible by humans hence classified as dietary fibre. Traditionally seaweed derived polysaccharides (hydrocolloids) have been used to provide thickening and gelling functionality to food stuffs and other industrial applications however there is emerging evidence to show that lower molecular weight polysaccharides and oligosaccharides derived from these hydrocolloids can also act as a source of soluble fibre and may have prebiotic activity. Recent developments in Japan and Korea have lead to the commercial availability of products containing low molecular weight seaweed derived fibre. There is also some evidence for the beneficial effects of seaweed derived fibre in other key health areas such as cardiovascular health cancer diabetes and obesity. However relatively little is known about the chemical physio-chemical and fermentation characteristics of seaweed fibre in the human gut. Some hydrocolloids notably guar gum (plant source) have also been employed for their health promoting properties in the areas of glucose tolerance and cholesterol lowering. However the use of hydrocolloids as functional food ingredients with health benefits for consumers has been rather limited and has focused more on uses in products for diabetics. It is particularly in the area of gut health that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) involved in hydrocolloid production and processing can enter the functional food ingredients market by using innovative processing technology. The total dietary fibre content of seaweed can be as high as 75% of the total dry weight and a high proportion of this is soluble. The fibre component essentially comprises the structural polysaccharides i.e. alginate and fucoidan in brown seaweeds carrageenan agar and porphyran in red seaweeds and ulvan in green seaweeds. As these fibres are primarily soluble they form viscous gels as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the fibre is fermented in the lower intestine but in general soluble and insoluble seaweed fibre tends to pass through the gut without being digested. In its natural form as part of the seaweed plant this fibre is typically high in molecular weight and passes through the gut too rapidly for the gut microflora to utilize it to any great extent. There is therefore a necessity to develop lower molecular weight forms that are more soluble and can be added at higher concentrations to food products without affecting the sensory properties of the product. The overall aim of the project is to realize an opportunity to produce low molecular weight polysaccharides (LMWP) from alginate- and agar-bearing seaweeds for applications in food & health. The two effective agar and alginate LMWPs identified by in vitro studies will be selected for assessment of prebiotic activity in a feeding trial in human volunteers (Ulster University) as part of an European Union (EU) study. The end points to be assessed will be stimulation of beneficial bacteria (bifidogenic effects) increased short chain fatty acid production beneficial effects on stool formation and improvements in gut barrier function. Additionally benefits of the LMWPs towards blood glucose levels (short term and acute) will be assessed.    ,NCT02608983

Healthy,The Effect of Blood Volume Changes on the Glucose Tolerance, In this study the investigators would like to elaborate on the mechanisms that lead to a higher insulin sensitivity after exercise training and a lower insulin sensitivity after bedrest. The investigators speculate that the concomitant chances in blood volume during training and bedrest might explain the changed insulin sensitivity because with a changing blood volume also the dilution space of the glucose will change. Furthermore the investigators would like to work on the influence of a changed capacity of skeletal muscle for glucose uptake and glycogen storage on the glucose sensitivity. Therefore A) a bed rest study with healthy untrained subjects and B) a training study with obese pre-diabetic patients will be conducted.    ,NCT02612597

Healthy,Renal NCE-MRI in Healthy Volunteers, Non-contrast enhanced (NCE) structural MRI enables to investigate renal anatomy. Additional NCE-MR acquisition modalities (e.g. Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) MRI Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MR Angiography (MRA) phase-contrast MRI) which could be used in combination with structural MRI in a single acquisition session have been identified to investigate in more detail renal function and structure opening the possibility to estimate local renal diffusion and blood perfusion beyond providing high-resolution anatomical accuracy. Preliminary to the identification of novel imaging biomarkers of renal disease progression perfusion and diffusion MR sequences need to be optimized for the renal compartment. Moreover NCE-MRIs acquired on healthy volunteers are required to investigate perfusion and diffusion changes in pathological kidneys as compared to normal and physiological condition. The objective of this study is to provide normal control NCE-MRI sequences to be used as reference for the investigation of perfusion and diffusion changes in the kidney of patients affected by chronic kidney disease (e.g. diabetic nephropathy nephrosclerosis autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease).    ,NCT02618460
Healthy,Primed vs Unprimed Facilitatory and Depressive Paired Associative Stimulation, Following brain injury (e.g. stroke) application of non-invasive brain stimulation may improve rehabilitative efforts. However the most effective method of non-invasive brain stimulation is unknown. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a method of non-invasive brain stimulation that pairs an electrical peripheral nerve stimulus with a magnetic stimulus to the head. This method can be applied in a manner that increases (facilitates) or decreases (depresses) excitability within the brain. Furthermore applying two consecutive PAS sessions within minutes of each other (called primed PAS) may augment changes in excitability more than a single PAS session alone. Thus the purpose of this study is to compare the effect of a double PAS session (primed PAS) to the effect of a single PAS session (unprimed PAS) and a sham PAS session in healthy individuals.    ,NCT02619643

Healthy,Communicating Multiple Disease Risks, Epidemiology seeks to improve public health by identifying risk factors for cancer and other diseases and conveying that information to relevant audiences. The audience is presumed to understand and use that information to make appropriate decisions about lifestyle behaviors and medical treatments. Yet even though a single risk factor can affect the risk of multiple health outcomes this information is seldom communicated to people in a way that optimizes their understanding of the importance of engaging in a single healthy behavior. Providing individuals with the ability to understand how a single behavior (obtaining sufficient physical activity) could affect their risk of developing multiple diseases could foster a more coherent and meaningful picture of the behavior's importance in reducing health risks increase motivation and intentions to engage in the behavior and over time improve public health. The proposed study translates epidemiological data about five diseases that cause significant morbidity and mortality (i.e. colon cancer breast cancer (women) heart disease diabetes and stroke) into a visual display that conveys individualized risk estimates in a comprehensible meaningful and useful way to diverse lay audiences.    ,NCT02621671

Healthy,Study of the Impact of Cheese Matrix on Postprandial Lipemia: a Clinical Study, Dairy products consumption is widely recommended in a healthy diet not only for bone growth and maintenance but also as a protein calcium and magnesium sources for an adequate diet. However dairy products are a major dietary source of saturated fat that is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. ln this context dietary guidelines still advocate a restriction in dietary saturated fat for optimal heart health. Nevertheless the association between saturated fat and the risk of heart disease remains highly controversial within the scientific community. There is also emerging evidence that the impact of dietary saturated fat will be significantly influenced by the food matrix through which it is provided. Recent studies indicate that cheese could have a major influence on intestinal fat absorption and the magnitude of the after meal release of fat in blood circulation. This is of interest because substantial evidence exists indicating that elevated levels of the after meal fat levels are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Therefore the improvement of the after meal fat levels produced by cheese consumption could well be part of novel therapeutic approaches contributing to improve cardiovascular risk. The general objective of the proposed research is to investigate how cheese consumption affects the after meal release of fat in blood circulation in healthy subjects. Our hypothesis is that compared to butter cheese consumption will have a beneficial impact on the after meal fat levels in healthy subjects. Favourable results from the proposed study will provide novel and much warranted evidence on the importance of considering changes in the after meal fat levels not only bad cholesterol as part of the on-going saturated fat-heart disease debate and that cheese should indeed be part of a healthy diet.    ,NCT02623790

Healthy,Glycemic Index of Instant Noodle With and Without Soup: Does Serving Method Have an Effect?, Glycemic index is commonly used as a method to determine the effect of a food to blood glucose. Despite its carbohydrate and fat content instant noodle is very popular in Asia including Indonesia. Based on the serving method there are instant noodle without and with soup. Studies have shown that water content of a meal may influence glycemic response of the meal and thus have an effect on the result of GI measurement. However none specifically studied instant noodles nor the additional water content as soup (not incorporated in the food matrix). Therefore this study aims to determine whether the serving method of instant noodle (with and without soup) may influence the glycemic response and glycemic index value of the meal.    ,NCT02625350

Healthy,Measurements of Corneal Biomechanical Properties Using a Dynamic Scheimpflug Analyzer for Normal Adults in South Korea, The human cornea is affected by the magnitude and velocity of both internal and external forces because the cornea has both static and dynamic resistance components. Considering these natures of the human cornea many investigators have tried to demonstrate corneal biomechanical properties to understand these characteristics of the cornea. Corneal biomechanical properties are known to influence the accuracy of measurements in intraocular pressure (IOP) and are recognized as important factor to explain the susceptibility of development of glaucomatous damage. Until recently the only instrument which enabled the in vivo measurements of the ocular biomechanical properties was ocular response analyzer (ORA Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments Depew NY USA).8 The ORA has been used to assess the biomechanical properties of the cornea according to the dynamic bidirectional applanation process. A dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer (corneal visualization Scheimpflug technology [Corvis ST] OCULUS Wetzlar Germany) has been introduced recently and has become a useful instrument for evaluating corneal biomechanical properties. The dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer captures the dynamic process of corneal deformation caused by an air puff using an ultra-high-speed Scheimpflug camera at a rate of up to 4330 images per second. Until now well-organized analysis on the normative data of the corneal biomechanical profiles measured with the dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer has not been reported yet. Hence in the present study we aim to conduct normative data analysis for the corneal biomechanical properties with the dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer in South Korea.    ,NCT02627170
Healthy,Impact of Training Status on Bioavailability of Flavanones, Flavonoids are compounds that have been proven to have a beneficial effect on health such as reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and in some cases cancer.

Healthy,Assessment of Millet Oat and Rye Porridge Breakfasts Glucose and Gastric Emptying, Breakfast porridges are made from milled grains and are commonly eaten worldwide. Traditionally different grains are used in different countries. For example oats are more common in the Anglo-Saxon countries; rye is favoured in the Scandinavian countries whilst millet is very common in parts of India and Africa. However the nutritional value and potential metabolic and health effects may vary dramatically between different grains. For example what is the effect of the different grains on blood sugar or on how fast the stomach empties after eating the porridge and how full people feel. All these physiological responses may differ between these grains resulting in potential health benefits. RESEARCH QUESTION: The investigators hypothesise that porridges made from different grains will behave differently during the digestion and cause differences in blood glucose levels gastric emptying and appetite. This study which is a 4-way randomized cross over pilot study in healthy participants aims to answer this research question. The participants will be asked to eat a porridge breakfasts made with oats rye and millet of different varieties (but containing the same amount of calories) in 4 morning studies one week apart. MRI will be used to monitor the gastrointestinal fate of the breakfasts and measure gastric emptying using MRI blood glucose levels using a finger prick test and self-reported appetite scores.    ,NCT02653274

Healthy,Substrate Metabolism Growth Hormone Signaling (GH) and Insulin Sensitivity During GH and Ketone Bodies Infusion, Background: Humans naturally produce ketone bodies under daily living conditions. The main ketone bodies are two functioning acids beta-hydroxybutyric acid (3-OHB) and acetoacetate and the pH-neutral but odorous acetone. In the fed state level of 3-OHB is suppressed to an almost unmeasurable level while in the fasted state it rises to 0.1-0.5 millimoles (mM). Main regulation of ketone synthesis is the abundance of sugars and resulting adaptations in insulin secretion. Thus ketone bodies are formed when sugar is not readily available and insulin is suppressed. This picture is to a certain degree seen in acute inflammatory states and indeed during starvation where level of 3-OHB increases to 5-8 mM. Hypothesis:   1. Ketone bodies changes the insulin sensitivity and substrate metabolism in human subjects   2. Ketone bodies changes the GH signaling in muscle and adipose tissue Aim: The investigators wish to provide knowledge on changes in metabolites and shift in signaling pathways and insulin sensitivity during GH infusion and concomitant ketone bodies infusion among healthy subjects.    ,NCT02655263

Healthy,Assessment of the Changes in Cortical and Medullary Renal Blood Flow During Exercise in Healthy Subjects Using Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound, Renal parenchymal blood flow can be divided in cortical and medullary blood flow. Changes and factors affecting renal medullary blood flow have not been studied in detail previously as investigators/doctors did not have tools to monitor renal medullary blood flow in vivo. Since Trueta first described renal medullary blood flow multiple attempts have been made to study renal medullary blood flow using invasive methods. Recently renal medullary blood flow measurement using contrast US has emerged as a promising technique that investigators can use to study renal medullary blood flow in vivo. In this study investigators are aiming to study changes in renal parenchymal (cortical and medullary) blood flow with exercise in healthy subject.    ,NCT02672722
Healthy,Safety and Efficacy of Two Tetanus-Diphtheria Vaccines for a Donor Hyper Immunization Program, Many plasma donation centers have Tetanus immunization programs that are implemented in order to collect plasma with high levels of tetanus antibodies. The immunization program requires participants to receive multiple tetanus vaccinations over a period of time with the goal of hyper-immunizing them to tetanus. Their antibody-rich plasma is then used to manufacture a tetanus immunoglobulin product which helps with the prophylaxis and treatment of tetanus disease. The Tetanus vaccine previously used for these programs is no longer being manufactured. Therefore we must evaluate the safety and efficacy of a different vaccine when used for this purpose. The only other FDA approved Tetanus vaccines currently available for adults in the US are combination vaccines that also immunize against Diphtheria and/or Pertussis. In this study the investigators will evaluate two vaccines that are combinations of Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td). Investigators will not evaluate any vaccines containing Pertussis antigen. The vaccines to be evaluated are manufactured by MassBiologics and Sanofi Pasteur (Tenivac). The package insert for these vaccines indicates they should be administered to previously vaccinated people once every 10 years. However this study will evaluate whether they are safe and effective for dosing every 90 days. The investigators hypothesize that at least 25% of study subjects will have a positive response to at least one of the five planned doses. Each vaccine will be evaluated separately.    ,NCT02673255

HEALTHY,Biological Aging of Skeletal Muscles in Humans, Aging affects almost all the tissues and physiological functions and skeletal muscle is the most affected organ. The progressive decline of the weight and the muscular function linked to the aging contributes to the lack of autonomy and dependence but also to an increase of the mortality risks. Sarcopenia is also a prevalent condition because it is detected in 13-24% of 60 years old and 50% of 80 years old and more. However strong inter-individual variations of this prevalence of sarcopenia exists. The key issue is to understand why the biological aging of the skeletal muscle is so different between people. In this study mechanisms involved in biological aging of the skeletal muscle in aging people (same chronological age) will be specified.    ,NCT02675192

Healthy,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Human Supraclavicular Brown Adipose Tissue - MIBAT Study, Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is unique in its capability to convert chemical energy directly into heat. Active BAT increases energy expenditure and can thereby counteract obesity and insulin resistance. Currently the imaging method of choice to assess BAT morphology and function is 18F-FDG-PET/CT which is expensive and exposes patients or healthy volunteers to ionizing radiation thus impeding larger prospective studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could constitute a suitable alternative and preliminary small-scale studies are promising. The overall aim of this research proposal is to develop reliable magnetic resonance imaging techniques to facilitate the study of brown adipose tissue in human adults specifically in the context of endocrine disease. Specifically investigators want to   1. Develop a reliable MR imaging protocol for human BAT and compare BAT volume to cold induced nonshivering thermogenesis as a measure of BAT activity.   2. Assess the intra-individual variance of BAT volume measured by MRI.   3. Evaluate direct measurement of BAT temperature by functional MRI.    ,NCT02682706

Healthy,DPP4 Inhibition & Beta Cell Function, This study is being done to determine the role of a hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) on insulin secretion and to study how GLP-1 works in in diabetic individuals as compared to non-diabetic individuals under fasting conditions. GLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone made in the intestines. It is released into the circulating blood after eating and helps to control the blood glucose levels by increasing insulin secretion by cells in the pancreas. However the exact method by which GLP-1 causes insulin secretion and how GLP-1 activity is changed in diabetic persons remain unclear. This research is being done to address these questions and better understand the function of GLP-1. In this research the investigators will use a synthetic form of Exendin-9 to determine the effects of GLP-1 on insulin secretion in diabetic and non-diabetic persons. Exendin-9 acts as a blocker of GLP-1 action allowing us to study the specific effects of the GLP-1 hormone. Exendin-9 is an investigational compound which means it is still being tested in research studies and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In this study the investigators will also use the drug Sitagliptin which is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study use of Sitagliptin is considered investigational since it is not being used for treatment of diabetes but is instead being used to understand how GLP-1 works and to better understand how medications like Sitagliptin work in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.    ,NCT02683187

Healthy,Tongue Motor Recruitment During Exercise, The prevalence of dysphagia may be as high as 22% in individuals over 50 years of age. There are few therapeutic options offered to these individuals. One more recent therapeutic option is Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) which has been used successfully to maintain or increase expiratory force generating pressures cough function and swallowing in a number of disease populations. Recently the investigators have noted improvements in oral transit time during swallowing in individuals with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) that could potentially be attributed to improved base of tongue functioning and muscle activation. There has been one study that demonstrated that breathing training resulted in increased and prolonged submental (under the chin) muscle activation as evidenced by surface electromyography. However no studies have investigated the activation of the tongue muscles during various swallowing and breathing exercises. A small needle electrode (fine wire EMG) is standard of care in diagnosing muscular diseases because it can determine amount of muscle recruitment for muscles throughout the body. This aim of this research study is to examine the effects of breathing exercises and swallowing exercises on tongue muscle activity in healthy adults.    ,NCT02687737

Healthy,Effect of Vitamin E on Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, One-third of the US population has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) due to obesity and ~8 million of these individuals have a progressive form of the disease non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently there are no noninvasive ways to determine which individuals with NAFLD will develop NASH. This is of medical importance since NASH can be a prelude to the development of end-stage liver disease. The study of NAFLD has been limited by several factors including the difficulties associated with studying liver metabolism in vivo in humans. Our group has pioneered new methods that use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to measure intermediary hepatic metabolism in humans with a goal of directly studying the pathophysiology of bland steatosis and NASH. In this study these noninvasive methods will be used to characterize and compare the metabolic alterations that accompany bland steatosis and NASH and test the hypothesis that detects if hepatic mitochondrial metabolism contribute to both disorders. Such characterization is fundamental to establishing a rational approach to the prevention and treatment of NAFLD and may provide simple non-invasive methods to differentiate benign and progressive forms of NAFLD. This proposal will be addressed via separate isotopic studies occurring at different time points during a prolonged fast. In subjects with NAFLD these studies will be carried out before and after treatment with Vitamin E or placebo. Healthy subjects will participate in initial baseline studies only without Vitamin E or placebo intervention. The study is designed to harness the physiologic changes that occur with short- and long-term fasting to provide a rapid and cost-effective method to accomplish the aims of the application.    ,NCT02690792

Healthy,Assessment of Dietary Biomarkers and Metabolic Effects After the Intake of Milk and Cheese," Dietary biomarkers are compounds in biofluids that directly reflect the intake of specific foods or food groups. Their exploration and use in the field of dietary assessments could provide an objective measure of actual intake complementing classical assessment methods (e.g. food frequency questionnaire 24h recalls). To date only a limited number of foods have been covered by validated biomarkers. The study is part of the international project ""The Food Biomarker Alliance (FOODBALL)"". The study described here has been assigned to assess biomarkers of the intake of milk and cheese. Up to now there is an evident lack of data on specific and validated biomarkers of milk and cheese (dairy products) which belong to the most relevant public health related foods in Europe. This study will further provide novel insights into the influence of fermentation of milk-based foods on metabolic effects and postprandial adaptations which has not yet been studied in depth before using cheese as fermented product. Outcomes will support and expand earlier findings on correlation between the intake of fermented dairy products intake and human health.    ",NCT02705560

Healthy,Risk Factors of Post-ERCP Pancreatitis in Patients Receiving Rectal Indomethacin, Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP)remains the most frequent adverse event of ERCP. Rectal indomethacin as one kind of classic NSAIDs has been proved to be effective in reducing the incidence of PEP. It has been widely used to prevent PEP in patients especially those with potentially high risks of PEP. However rectal indomethacin can not completely eradicate the occurrence of PEP. The rate of PEP in patients receiving indomethacin ranges from 3.2% to 9.2%. The risk factors of PEP in patients receiving rectal indomethacin remains unclear. The aim of the study was to identify potential risk factors in high-risk patients whose received administration of prophylactic rectal indomethacin after ERCP.    ,NCT02709421

Healthy,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Motility in Crohn's 1, Crohn's disease (CD) is becoming more common. One of the main features of this disease is weight loss and malnutrition with symptoms such as tummy aches and bloating. These problems have a strong negative effect on the patients' quality of life but the causes of these problems are not well understood. Enteroendocrine cells are nutrient sensors in the bowel that secrete special chemicals (called hormones) that control appetite and the movements all the gut. The investigators think that this control mechanism goes wrong in Crohn's patients and they have set off to do more research on this. Looking at the inside work of the gut has always been difficult and at times unpleasant for patients however recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are allowing the investigators to study the workings of the gut in greater detail and without discomfort for the patients. Before studying the Crohn's patients it is necessary to run a set of pilot experiments in healthy volunteers using a test meal and subsequent MRI imaging to look at the motion of the gut. This validation stage of the methodology is essential before embarking in more detailed studies in the patients.    ,NCT02717117

Healthy,Effects of Cocoa Procyanidins on Vascular Function, There is a question regarding the role of higher flavanol oligomers (procyanidins) and of intestinal flavanol metabolites i.e. valerolactones in the context of flavanol intake-related vascular effects. Only flavanol monomers and to a certain degree dimers are absorbed in the small intestine and enter circulation. Higher oligomers (procyanidins) are not absorbed and are catabolized by the colonic microflora. The catabolites enter the circulation. Phenolic acids and valerolactones represent a significant proportion of these catabolites reaching peak concentrations in the order of 6-10 h post ingestion. The vascular effects of these colonic microbiome-derived flavanol derivatives have not been studied so far. The purpose of the study is to determine the timecourse of endothelial function along with flavanol catabolites & metabolites during acute sustained and acute on sustained ingestion of procyanidins as compared to previously used flavanol interventions and flavanol free control.    ,NCT02728466

Healthy,Effects of Acute Red Raspberry Consumption on Vascular Function in Healthy Individuals, Accumulating evidence from epidemiological and human intervention studies indicates that the cardiovascular health benefits of diets rich in fruits and vegetables are (in part) related to their (poly)phenol content. Raspberries are rich in phenolic and polyphenolic compounds in particular procyanidins ellagitannins and anthocyanins but also phenolic acids. At present a small number of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of berry (poly)phenols on validated surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease risk have shown promising results. However to date very few human studies have specifically investigated the effects of raspberry (poly)phenols on cardiovascular function in healthy subjects. Moreover ellagitannin-derived metabolites are believed to persist for a long period of time in the blood and urine. Therefore the investigators will investigate the presence of plasma and urinary raspberry-derived metabolites 24h post-consumption. To the investigators knowledge the effects of red raspberry consumption on vascular function in humans have not been investigated before. This information is necessary for the planning of long-term studies aiming to assess the potential beneficial effects of raspberries. Therefore this study aims to investigate the potential role of red raspberry (poly)phenols in the modulation of vascular function by monitoring changes in vascular function together with the major (poly)phenol derivatives/metabolites in plasma.    ,NCT02734901

Healthy,Human Genomic Population Structure and Phenotype-genotype Variation in ADME Genes in Five Populations," Physicians know that their patients can react differently to the same medical treatment: for some of them the drug will prove inefficient whereas for others it might provoke side-effects sometimes rather serious. Such differences in response to drug intake are due to several factors of which molecular variations in specific genes named "" ADME "" (Absorption Distribution Metabolism Excretion). This project aims at investigating the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the diversity of ADME genes in human populations. Because of their role at the interface between the organism and its chemical environment ADME genes are likely targets of recent selective pressures linked to changes in the environments in which humans evolved such as changes in dietary habits for instance. The aim of this project is to study the diversity of ADME genes and of their expression in five populations located along a latitudinal axis that extends from East Africa to Central Europe passing through the Arabian Peninsula and the Mediterranean area so as to take into account environmental factors that might have influenced the evolution of this diversity. This project is thus intended to evidence the evolutionary mechanisms that shaped genomic regions that are functionally important from the clinical and epidemiological point of view. Moreover it will allow us to extend the knowledge of human molecular diversity and its evolution to a key-region of the peopling history of our species.    ",NCT02789527

Healthy,Multi-country Study- Effect of Dietary Fats on Fat Deposition," There is existing evidence to show that vegetable oils having unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position with predominantly palmitic acid (C16:0) or stearic acid (C18:0) in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions of fat molecules do not raise serum cholesterol levels. These observations have come to be known as or explained by the ""sn-2 hypothesis"". New evidence have also emerged to show that saturated fatty acids (C16:0 C18:0) in the sn-1 and -3 positions reduces fat deposition in a rat model. Therefore further studies in humans are warranted to confirm these earlier findings. Fats and oils are made up of >90% triacylglycerol (TAG)- fat molecules which consist of a glycerol backbone to which 3 esterified fatty acids are attached. The positions of fatty acid attachment are referred to by stereospecific numbers sn -1 -2 and -3. Early evidence shown that the unique stereospecificity of fatty acid distribution on the palm fat molecule conferred health benefits in that it inhibited experimental atherosclerosis in the rabbit model. In vegetable oils oleic acid [a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)] is predominantly situated at the sn-2 position while in animals fats it is predominantly palmitic acid or stearic acid (C16:0 or C18:0-saturated fat) that is situated there. Even though palm olein and lard have similar proportions of saturated fatty acid (SFA) MUFA and polyunsatuared fatty acid (PUFA) they differ significantly in their positional distribution on the TAG molecule. Palm olein TAG contains only 7-11 % palmitic acid at the sn-2 position while about 87% is unsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid and linoleic acid). Lard has the highest amount of palmitic acid in the sn-2 position at 70%. On the other hand in human milk palmitic acid is predominantly in sn-2 (53-57 %) while cow milk fat contains less palmitic acid (38 %) there. It is now believed that the distribution of fatty acids in the TAG is more important than the fatty acid composition alone in conferring the oils' 'saturated' or 'unsaturated' properties. In this proposed study the effects on the outcome measures investigated of different fatty acids (palmitic acid oleic acid linoleic acid) at the sn-1 sn-2 and sn-3 positions of the TAG molecule in three different test fats will be investigated.

Healthy,Effects of Vitamin D3 Supplementation on Cognitive Function in Community Dwelling Older Adults, Ireland is predicted to have the highest older adult population growth of any European Union country. A substantial economic and social challenge of this projected growth is the increased incidence of cognitive impairment and the likelihood of progression to dementia. Dementia's such as Alzheimer's disease typically have a long prodromal stage with brain changes identifiable from the earliest stages of neuropathology providing an opportunity for intervention. Switching to a strategy of earlier identification and prevention would significantly reduce prevalence and the associated cost.

Healthy,White Adipose Tissue Clocks and High Calorie Feeding, Peripheral tissues (e.g. liver adipose muscle) express self-sustained circadian clocks that coordinate daily metabolic rhythms. The timing of clock rhythms in peripheral tissues is highly sensitive to feeding-fasting signals across the sleep-wake transition. Nutritional insults such as high fat overfeeding (HF-OF) have been shown to attenuate clock gene expression in peripheral tissues resulting in a deleterious re-programming of the circadian metabolome. Studies in humans have only superficially investigated how the circadian clock machinery is impacted by nutritional signals. The overall goal of this pilot project is to take the first steps toward developing translational methods to investigate links between changes in energy flux and the circadian system in human tissues. Using an innovative ex vivo cell culture approach the investigators will examine the impact of 3-days of HF-OF compared to eucaloric (EU) feeding on the expression of core clock genes in human subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). The Investigators hypothesize that compared to EU the amplitude of clock gene expression in SAT measured over 24hrs will be attenuated following short-term HF-OF. This pilot project will serve as a launch point for designing future studies into the effects of diet and exercise on the circadian control of metabolism in adipose tissue depots as well as other tissues (e.g. muscle).    ,NCT02809482

Healthy,Study of Supplement's Antioxidant Properties That Contains Natural Extracts, While it is well accepted that a low level of RONS production is necessary to maintain physiological function too much formation of RONS are believed to participate in biomolecules damage. Damage of lipids proteins and DNA/RNA to cellular and tissue level as a consequence of oxidative stress has been linked to a number of serious diseases including cancer cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as hypertension and atherosclerosis neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's dementias diabetes and the process of aging. The dietary intake of antioxidants is thought to play a major role in oxidative stress network. Many epidemiologic studies have reported an inverse association between vegetable and fruit consumption with reduced risk of chronic diseases especially cancer and CVDs. However although many clinical trials have been conducted with vitamins (E C or their combinations) their in vivo protective effect remains uncertain. Therefore the possibility that the complex mixture of phytochemicals in foods may contribute to their protecting effects has been raised. In this concept it is possible multiple compounds to act through complimentary or synergistic mechanisms to present a greater biologic effect than can be achieved by any individual component To investigate this hypothesis a double-blind randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in order to investigate the effects of a multi-micronutrient supplement against oxidative stress in apparently healthy adults.    ,NCT02837107

Healthy,Systemic Inflammatory Response to CCRE, Purpose: The purpose of this study is to classify volunteers as endotoxin-responders or non-responders following inhalation of 20000 EU Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin (CCRE). Endotoxin is a commonly encountered bioaerosol and component of indoor and outdoor air pollution. For reasons that remain unclear some individuals appear to be more susceptible to the inflammatory effects of inhaled endotoxin than are others possibly owing to single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene that influence TLR4 signaling and function. These susceptible individuals represent a population of particular interest for further mechanistic studies of the effects of endotoxin and for therapeutic trials. Susceptibility to inhaled endotoxin will be determined by measuring change in peripheral blood neutrophil counts a biomarker of systemic inflammation following inhaled CCRE. In our previous work the investigators have found that inhalation of 20000 EU CCRE is well tolerated and induces measurable increase in neutrophil content of peripheral blood in susceptible individuals. Our hope is that this CCRE inhalation protocol can be employed to screen large populations for susceptibility to the inflammatory effect of inhaled endotoxin.    ,NCT02847247

However the effects of these interventions on biomechanical gait indicators have not been fully debated yet. Therefore this study aimed to compare the effects of these two training protocols on functional capacities and biomechanical gait parameters of elderly women.    ,NCT02852668

Healthy,Protein Requirements for Active Adolescent Males (IAAO-AM), Protein requirements in active individuals have been suggested to be greater than the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA). Nutritional requirements for dietary amino acids in adolescents have traditionally been determined utilizing the nitrogen balance technique which is prone to underestimating protein requirements. As a result there is a need to re-evaluate recommendations in order to characterize how dietary amino acid needs may be modulated by physical activity. Recent studies using the minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique have suggested that protein requirements in young men are at least 50% higher than the RDA based on nitrogen balance data. The purpose of this study is to measure the protein requirement in adolescent males using the IAAO technique in the presence of a variable intensity exercise stimulus.    ,NCT02859181

Healthy,Effect of Inspiratory Muscle Training on Recreational Cyclists, Introduction: The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has showed great benefits to the respiratory autonomic system and mainly to the improvement of physical performance in healthy subjects. The latter is related to the improvement of respiratory muscle strength decreased of dyspnoea peripheral fatigue and delay in activation of muscle metaboreflex during exercise. However there is no consensus about the best training load to IMT because the prescription has been done only using percentage of the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and 60% of MIP has been the most used. Therefore the IMT prescription protocol that takes into account the respiratory muscle strength and endurance can provide additional benefits to protocols commonly applied once that respiratory muscle differs from the other muscles due to its greater muscle endurance. In the sense the IMT using inspiratory critical pressure (PThC) comes up with an alternative since the PThC calculation considers these characteristics. Objective:To evaluate the effect of the IMT using PThC on cardiovascular respiratory metabolic and autonomic responses in recreational cyclists and compare it to a IMT using 60% of MIP. Methods: Thirty men recreational cyclists (20-40 years) will be randomized to placebo group (PG n = 10) PThC group (PTHCG n = 10) and 60% of MIP group (60G n = 10) taking into account the age and functional aerobic capacity. All subjects will perform the following evaluations: cardiovascular autonomic tests [heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) at rest and after active postural change] pulmonary function testing respiratory muscle strength (RMS) test cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) incremental respiratory muscle endurance test (iRME) [maximum respiratory pressure sustained for 1 minute (PThMAX)] and constant respiratory loads test (95% 100% and 105% of PThMAX) both using an linear inspiratory load resistor (PowerBreathe K5). The PThC will be obtained from the linear regression using the time(TLIM) of and load of each constant test (95% 100% and 105% PThMAX). During evaluations the ECG (BioAmp FE132) blood pressure (BP) using Finometer Pro (Finapress Medical Systems) and respiration (Marazza) signals will be acquired. The signals will be coupled by data acquisition and analysis device (Power Lab 8/35) and sampled at 1000 Hz. Moreover the oxyhemoglobin deoxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin responses will be measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (Oxymon MKIII) sampled at 250Hz. The IMT will be performed for 11 weeks (3 times/week 1-hour duration). The session will consist of 5-min warm-up (50% of the training load) and 3 sets of 15 minutes (breathing against 100% of the training load) with 1-min interval between them. Heart rate and BP will be monitored in all training sessions. The RMS iRME respiratory constant load tests and CPET will be performed before and after the training and in the 3rd and 7th week (for training load adjustment). The pulmonary function testing and the cardiovascular autonomic tests will be performed only before and after training. The data will be analyzed by specific statistical tests (parametric and nonparametric) according to the data distribution and their respective variances. Significance will be set at p<0.05. Expected results: It is expected that the training performed by PTHCG when compared to training performed by 60G and PG promotes: greater improvementin workload (Watts) and peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak); increasing in MIP and iRME; decreasing of dyspnoea and peripheral fatigue; delay in activation of muscle metaboreflex in the CPET and iRME; improvement incardiac parasympathetic autonomic modulation and reducing cardiac and peripheral sympathetic modulation. Moreover it is expected that the results can provide information for a better understanding of the responses obtained by the PThC training in the different evaluated systems. In addition these results will allow the use of this method by health professionals as a new assessment tool and IMT prescription.    ,NCT02984189

Healthy,Effect of Prebiotic Intake on Gut Microbiota in Healthy Adults, In recent years the importance of the gut microbiota to human health has been demonstrated. In adulthood the microbial profile is relatively stable yet can be transiently altered by factors such as diet or antibiotic treatment. Such changes may be beneficial as gut microbiota has been shown to differ in normal versus disease states including inflammatory bowel disease obesity type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. Given this relationship there is intense interest in designing interventions that positively influence the gut microbial profile. Prebiotics are non-digestible fermentable oligo- and polysaccharides that alter the colonic environment in favour of health-promoting bacterial species such as bifidobacteria which selectively ferment prebiotics. Given the ability of prebiotics to beneficially alter the microbial profile there is a need to identify the dosing requirements to positively modulate the gut microbiota. This study will test the effect of two doses of prebiotic on gut microbiota taxonomy and diversity.    ,NCT03042494

Healthy,Impact of Genetic Polymorphism on Drug-Drug Interactions Involving CYP2D6, CYP2D6 is characterized by a huge variability in the general population mainly because of genetic polymorphism and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). CYP2D6 genotype is known to have an impact on the extent of DDIs. Indeed several studies have pointed out differential DDIs extent according to CYP2D6 genotype. The terms phenoconversion and phenotype switch are both used to describe the phenomenon by which a given subject changes his phenotype to another due external influence such as DDIs. When given a sufficiently strong CYP2D6 inhibitor the phenotype of an individual with no mutant allele (extensive metabolizer EM) of CYP2D6 can be modified to a poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype. This vulnerability is also thought to be dependent on CYP2D6 genotype. Various combinations of alleles predict an EM genotype which represents about 60 to 70% of the general population. The aim of the study is to determine whether the presence of genetic mutation in CYP2D6 has an impact on DDIs involving the CYP2D6 enzyme. Our interest focuses on CYP2D6 EM carriers of two fully functional alleles and carriers of one non-functional and one functional allele. In order to elucidate this question CYP2D6 activity will be measured on healthy volunteers by administration of single low doses of dextromethorphan and tramadol in presence or not of duloxetine and paroxetine two known CYP2D6 inhibitors.    ,NCT03054220

Healthy,Neurophysiological Impact of a Fronto-temporal tDCS Stimulation in Healthy Subjects: a Multimodal Imaging Approach," tDCS is a technique emerging as a prospective therapy for neurologic psychiatric and addictive disorders. Specifically fronto-temporal tDCS with anodal stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathodal stimulation over the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) has been reported to reduce treatment-resistant auditory hallucinations (AH) negative symptoms and insight of the illness in schizophrenia. However despite an increasing use in clinical settings tDCS suffers from limitations especially regarding the strength and the duration of therapeutic effects. Some imaging reports suggest that tDCS effects are not restricted to the brain areas located under the electrodes but spread through distributed cortical networks functionally connected with the targets and reach subcortical areas. Overall these studies suggest that tDCS modulates functional connectivity within and across resting-state networks and brain activity. However these effects are currently described at different levels depending on the imaging technique used. Moreover the majority of studies have focused on motor cortex stimulation while the specific effects of fronto-temporal tDCS are scarce. Finally effects of the stimulation applied online are rarely inspected. According to the therapeutic effects of fronto-temporal tDCS on schizophrenia and the dopaminergic pathophysiological hypothesis of schizophrenia the effect of fronto-temporal tDCS on dopaminergic transmission is of major interest. As the cortex is densely connected with basal ganglia areas tDCS effects are probably capable to reach subcortical dopaminergic areas. Indeed recent fMRI studies highlighted subcortical effects of tDCS applied at the cortical level including modulations of cortico-striatal and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity. In addition some studies suggest that cortical stimulation by other approaches such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) modulates dopaminergic transmission. However tDCS effects on dopaminergic transmission have been investigated only indirectly. Finally information about biological effects of tDCS is scattered and creating a coherent ensemble is a mandatory and critical step to understand the mechanisms of action of tDCS. According to the hypothesis that fronto-temporal tDCS modulates brain activity connectivity and dopaminergic transmission the aim of this project is to reveal the combined neurobiological impact of an online single session of fronto-temporal tDCS in a unique experiment by developing a simultaneous multimodal imaging approach (PET-MRI). The online implementation of the stimulation will allow deciphering changes induced during and after stimulation. As a first step before investigating patients with schizophrenia healthy subjects will be involved in the present study. The distributed changes will be explored at rest through:   -  Spontaneous functional connectivity assessed by functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI).   -  Brain activity assessed by cerebral blood flow quantitatively and directly measured by arterial spin labelling (ASL).   -  Connectivity assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).   -  Specific and localized dopaminergic transmission evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) using dopaminergic D2 subtype receptor availability via [11C]raclopride binding. The pioneering aspects of the project are to use an innovative simultaneous multimodal imaging system adopt the tDCS montage used in our validated therapeutic context and apply tDCS online. We expect that our unique approach will provide an imaging biomarker essential to improve our understanding of:   1. the ""normal brain"" and further deficient mechanisms underlying schizophrenia as well as neurological disorders.   2. neurobiological effects of tDCS in order to:   -  Bring key element of the proof of concept of tDCS   -  Optimize tDCS in a therapeutic context   -  Suggest a marker of the therapeutic response    ",NCT03056170

Healthy,Gender in Face-Voice Integration, Bayesian models of perception represent a promising approach to describe information processing by the brain. Predictive coding hypothesizes a process in which top-down expectations are continuously compared across multiple hierarchical levels with bottom-up sensory inputs and the differences or error signals are propagated in a bottom-up direction. The investigators hypothesize that strong expectations are best investigated in expert processes such as face and voice recognition in humans. Individuals in complex social systems need to extract socially relevant information in a fast and efficient manner; hence the majority of humans constitute face voice and gender experts. Nevertheless linking such combined abilities to brain activity with regards to the predictive coding hypothesis has not been attempted.Our results suggest asymmetric contributions of visual and auditory signals to the gender classification task. This sensitive psychophysical procedure is implemented in a decoding approach using fMRI and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA). The investigators plan to test whether cortical areas implicated in processing auditory and visual gender signals show similar asymmetries.    ,NCT03058133

Healthy,Deductive Reasoning and Math Learning Difficulty, Most studies to date that have examined the factors underlying math achievement in children have focused on basic numerical knowledge. Yet math skills are clearly not limited to basic numerical knowledge and recent behavioral studies suggest a relationship between math and deductive reasoning skills. The goal of this study is to determine the neural mediators of this relationship using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The investigators will ask children from 8 to 14 to complete a standardized math achievement test and measure their brain activity while they process deductive arguments. The investigators will then correlate brain activity during reasoning to individual math skills to identify the brain regions in which activity during reasoning is modulated by math skill.    ,NCT03059758
Healthy,The Change of Tissue Oxygen Saturation Following Volatile Anesthesia, General anesthesia can affect tissue oxygen saturation and microcirculatory reactivity. However the differences in microcirculation caused by anesthetic methods have not been well studied. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures peripheral tissue oxygen saturation noninvasively and can be used in conjunction with vascular occlusion (VOT) experiments. The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in NIRS derived tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and microcirculatory reactivity by VOT after inhalation anesthesia in healthy population. This prospective observational study will be performed on 57 healthy patients who had undergone elective surgery under volatile general anesthesia. The investigators measure StO2 and microvascular reactivity using NIRS combined with vascular occlusion test (VOT). The parameters were performed twice per patient before and after the induction of anesthesia. Occlusion slope and recovery slope during VOT will be compared before and after anesthesia. Moreover the changes depend on the age will be analyzed.    ,NCT03060798

Healthy,Millets and Oats MRI, Breakfast porridges made from milled grains are commonly eaten worldwide. Traditionally different grains are used in different countries. For example oats are more common in the Anglo-Saxon countries whilst millet is very common in parts of India and Africa. However the nutritional value of different grains and their potential effects on the body may vary dramatically: for example the effect on blood sugar on how fast the stomach empties after eating and how full people may feel. RESEARCH QUESTION: The investigators think that a pearl millet breakfast will cause a smaller rise in blood sugar compared with an oat breakfast containing the same number of calories. The investigators also think that there will be a difference in how full people feel and how fast their stomach will empty. These 2 breakfasts will be fed to each one of 26 healthy volunteers one week apart. A safe medical imaging method (MRI) will be used to look at how quickly the breakfast empty from the stomach and how this affects the small bowel. Blood glucose levels will be measured using a finger prick test (the same as used by diabetics) and some small blood samples will be taken from a vein in the arm to measure the chemicals released by the gut after feeding gut hormones.    ,NCT03068039

Healthy,A Comparison of High-intensity Interval Training Protocols on Health and Fitness, Recently it has been demonstrated that multimodal high-intensity interval training (MM-HIIT) (utilizing resistance-based and functional movements) can produce similar aerobic adaptations compared to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) using rowing but with greater muscle performance in females. In addition HIIT has been shown to be more enjoyable than continuous training and this may lead to enhanced self-efficacy and increased physical activity.

Healthy,Food Intake Decisions, Functional Magnetic resonance study on the effect of cognitive context variables on the perception and valuation of food odorants and flavor. The study is composed of two experiments; in a first experiment we address the question of how valuation of food odors are modulated by 3 cognitive conditions (indulgence healthy and neutral). Food odors are delivered using a custom-made olfactometer. Here we hypothesize that cognitive regulation can modulate the primary sensory processing of food odors. We expect that cortical regions related with valuation and cognitive regulation such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex operate the modulation of primary olfactory cortex and amygdala. In a second experiment we aim to reveal the brain areas involved in integrating food color cues with odor and taste stimuli. Here we hypothesize that color cues are capable of biasing flavor attributes of food (flavor intensity) and that this bias occurs at different cortical areas commonly associate with multisensory integration such as the orbitofrontal cortex insula amygdala and hippocampus.    ,NCT03095833

Healthy,(18)F-FDG PET Database of Adult Healthy Individuals, Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurological disorder in the world affecting more than 50 million people worldwide. Approximately 35% of patients with epilepsy are refractory to all available antiepileptic drugs. Focal Hypometabolism on interictal [18F]-FDG PET is a hallmark of the Seizure Onset Zone as well as surrounding areas. Using [18F]-FDG PET is thus particularly useful to determine the seizure onset zone of epileptic patients and thus to guide surgical treatment when antiepileptic drugs fail. Interpretation of PET images primarily relies on standard visual analysis but statistical analysis with the widely used Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software improves the diagnostic yield of PET. Over the past years some authors have thus reported that the use of SPM can result in greater sensitivity and specificity of PET imaging in patients with partial epilepsy. In order to perform statistical analysis of PET images to compare brain metabolism of epileptic patients and healthy controls it is necessary to collect a normative database of [18F]-FDG PET images in healthy controls. The purpose of this study is (i) collect a normative database of [18F]-FDG PET images in healthy adults controls to evaluate rigorously the diagnostic value of multimodal imaging for non-invasive localization of the EZ and (ii) to evaluate the test-retest reliability of [18F]-FDG PET scanning.    ,NCT03100227

It is hypothesized that the post-exercise energy compensation will be greater in both conditions with stimuli (i.e. screen and music) compared with the control condition (i.e. exercise alone). STUDY DESIGN: Randomized 3-condition crossover study (within-subjects experimental design). PARTICIPANTS: The present study will recruit 25 male adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 years. Participants will be recruited via advertisements and word of mouth (first come first served approach). OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY PROTOCOL: Preliminary Visit The participants will attend one baseline session and three experimental sessions. The preliminary visit will include measurements related to anthropometry (body weight height waist circumference) and resting metabolic rate. Participants will also complete questionnaires in order to better characterize them. Experimental Sessions Each participant will be engaged in each of the following three 30-min experimental conditions followed by an ad libitum lunch: (1) walking/jogging on a treadmill at 60% of VO2 peak while watching a screen (exercise + screen); (2) walking/jogging on a treadmill at 60% of VO2 peak while listening to music (exercise + music); and (3) walking/jogging on a treadmill at 60% of VO2 peak with no other stimulus (control condition). MEASUREMENTS: The main measures for this study include: anthropometric measurements food intake appetite sensations energy expenditure resting metabolic rate and ratings of perceived exertion. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure will be post-exercise energy compensation. The food intake outcome will be assessed by using an ad libitum test meal immediately after the conditions and a dietary record for the remainder of the day. The energy expenditure outcome will be assessed by using an Actical accelerometer until bedtime. The secondary outcome measures will include appetite sensations and the ratings of perceived exertion (OMNI scale).    ,NCT03105622

Healthy,Non- Essential Amino Acid Requirements and Metabolism in Humans, Protein is a major structural component of all cells in the body. The nutritional importance of protein is because of their amino acids. 9 are called essential and 11 are called non-essential based on whether we need to get them from diet. This classification is based on studies done using older techniques. Recent studies suggest that these so called non-essential amino acids play important roles in our body's health. For the first time this proposal defines an experimental design to examine non- essential amino acid/nitrogen requirements and metabolism in humans using the Indicator Amino Acid Oxidation (IAAO) technique. The objective of the current study is to examine the application of IAAO technique to determine the non-essential amino acid/nitrogen requirement in adult humans.    ,NCT02009917

Healthy,Prebiotic Effect of a Jelly Containing Short Chain Fructo-Oligosaccharides and Sideritis Euboea Extract, The human intestinal microflora is characterized as a complex and dynamic microbial ecosystem with crucial contribution to our nutrition and welfare. Health-promoting genera such as Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. play a key role in digestion of nutrients production of short chain fatty acids and vitamins inhibition of harmful bacteria immunostimulation reduction of blood cholesterol and ammonia levels and restoration of normal flora after antibiotic therapy. Proteolytic species such as toxin-producing clostridia and toxigenic E. coli are considered as potential pathogens with detrimental effects to human host. Recently part of novel food research is directing towards the concept of prebiotics e.g. food ingredients that are not hydrolyzed by the human gastrointestinal tract and beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or limited number of bacteria in the colon that can improve host health. Fructo-oligosaccharides and inulin are considered as the most extensively studied and well-established prebiotics. In vitro and in vivo data suggest the bifidogenic effect of inulin and oligofructose which can be attributed to their selective fermentation by Bifidobacterium species. Due to their documented prebiotic properties both inulin and FOS are increasingly applied in novel food product development through the fortification of commonly ingested foodstuffs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the in vivo prebiotic effect of a functional food containing short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (sc-FOS) and Sideritis euboea extract on the faecal microflora composition of healthy human volunteers.    ,NCT00971113

Healthy,Metabolism of Isotonic Versus Hypotonic Maintenance Solutions in Fasting Healthy Adults, The prescription of intravenous maintenance solutions - although widespread - lacks important data on the optimal sodium and potassium content which has given rise to an important debate in the scientific literature. Our study compares two different infusion fluids in 12 healthy adult volunteers without renal failure in a single-blind randomized crossover design over two 48 hour periods during which subjects are not allowed to eat or drink. Fluid 1 is a premixed solution containing 54 mmol/L of sodium and 26 mmol/L of potassium; fluid 2 is sodium chloride 0.9% in glucose 5% with 40 mmol/L of potassium. Both solutions are administered at 25 mL/kg of ideal body weight as recommended by current guidelines (NICE 174) and both solutions are widely used in daily clinical practice. The primary hypothesis is that isotonic maintenance solutions lead to more fluid retention than hypotonic fluids. Metabolism of both solutions is assessed by sequential analysis of urine and serum clinical parameters and bioelectrical impedance analysis.    ,NCT02822898

Healthy,Effect of Constraining Joint Motions on Postural Control, A major advantage of understanding a neural control scheme is able to simultaneously perform multiple tasks based on the Uncontrolled Manifold (UCM) hypothesis by taking advantage of motor redundancy. The present study aims to investigate this hypothesis further by examining the effect of artificially eliminating knee and lumbar-thoracic joint motions on postural control when the arms performing targeting task simultaneously in standing. Subjects (Younger group: 20~35 years old; Elder group: 60~85 years old) will execute a targeting task with and without an additional ball-balancing task in standing with free joint motions and with restricted joint motions. The investigators expect to recruit 50 subjects for each group. Analyses of joint configuration variance on the stability of the center of mass (COM) position and the hand path will be performed using the UCM method of variance analysis. This method partitions joint configuration variance into one component consistent with the use of motor abundance and a component that leads to COM position or hand path variability. Furthermore the differences between the younger group and the elder group will be evaluated.    ,NCT01703377

Healthy,Does Transcutaneous Vagal Nerve Stimulation Improves Fear Extinction in Humans, A recent study with rats showed that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (VNS) facilitates extinction of fear (Pena Engineer & McIntyre Biological Psychiatry 2013). The hypothesized mechanism is that VNS both enhances memory consolidation (by increasing noradrenergic neurotransmission) and reduces anxiety (thus: preventing fear responses to the CS which may re-consolidate the fear memory). The effect was only apparent when VNS occurred during exposure of the fear conditioned stimulus (CS) and not when stimulation was given immediately following exposure. These results may have implications for the treatment of anxiety disorders in humans. However until recently the only means to investigate the effects of VNS on human fear learning would have required the invasive implantation of vagus nerve stimulators. This has fortunately changed as a non-invasive transcutaneous VNS device has been approved for use in the E.U. for the treatment of psychological disorders. This study proposes to use a t-VNS to investigate its effects on fear learning and extinction in (healthy) humans. Previous research has only investigated the effects it has on human mood and memory. The results obtained suggest that it reduces negative affect and enhances memory findings which are consistent with those reported for rats. It is thus reasonable to expect that t-VNS will facilitate the extinction of fear in humans. The present study aims to answer the following research questions: Does t-VNS during extinction training:   1. accelerates extinction curves   2. reduces spontaneous recovery of previously extinguished fear   3. reduce re-acquisition of fear   4. reduce generalization of fear to other stimuli that resemble the CS+?   5. facilitates the generalization of inhibitory learning to stimuli that resemble the CS-?    ,NCT02113306

Healthy,Post-exercise Food Intake Regulation in a Hot Environment, The potential of physical activity and other non-medicinal methods for the care and prevention of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders has been insufficiently used. There is a potential influence of environmental heat in energetic balance regulation. However the existing knowledge is insufficient to optimize physical activity programs based on the impact of exercise on energy intake regulation in hot climates. The aim of the present study is to define the major physiological determinants of short-term food intake regulation in young active and healthy men when exposed to different levels of metabolic activity and environmental temperatures. We will thus explore the biological mechanisms related to post-exercise relative energy intake. Post-rest and post-exercise energetic compensation will be analysed in these different environmental conditions with a special focus on the effect of the birth weight.

Healthy,Movement Assessment for Concussion Management, Previous work in the area of concussion management has focused heavily on neuro-cognitive testing. In addition to routine neuro-cognitive testing through Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT)this pilot study is designed to establish a comprehensive battery of clinical assessment through the utilization of functional movement and dynamic postural control assessments. The immediate application of these assessments will be focused on the male high school football player (who is at risk for concussion). Our pilot study aims determine the stability of ImPACT testing in youth athletes in light of ongoing neurodevelopment in this population. In addition this pilot work will implement additional tools focused on assessment of dynamic balance reaction time and agility. This approach will significantly enhance predictions of subsequent musculoskeletal injuries that have been shown to occur in concussed collegiate and professional athletes and that we believe are also occurring in our high school athletes. This battery of tests will provide clinicians with invaluable information to guide both rehabilitation of and return to play (RTP) decisions for concussed high school athletes. This pilot study will further track those athletes who sustain a concussion and assess increased risks for musculoskeletal injury.    ,NCT02776904
Healthy,Hypercoagulation Screening in Cancer, There is a complex mutual relationship between cancer and thrombosis. Indeed the tumor has the capacity to activate the hemostatic system and this leads to an increased thrombotic risk in cancer patients. Even in the absence of clinical manifestations cancer patients are commonly characterized by hemostatic abnormalities recognized only by laboratory testing which define the 'hypercoagulable state'. Of interest hypercoagulation has been repeatedly reported to be associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in various carcinomas. On the other hand thrombotic event can represent the first signal of the presence of an occult tumor. These findings suggest that the coagulant pathway might play a role in the preclinical phase of cancer. The investigators hypothesize that a persistent subclinical activation of the hemostatic system in an otherwise healthy subject may predispose not only to thrombosis but also to tumor formation and spreading. A major problem in primary cancer prevention is the lack of effective predictive markers of the disease. The HYPERCAN is an ongoing prospective Italian multicenter study organized around two tightly-interconnected research programs aiming to: 1_the assessment of thrombotic markers as a tool for cancer risk prediction in two large populations of healthy subjects i.e. a group of healthy blood donors of Bergamo and Milano Provinces and a subgroup of Moli-sani subjects of the Molise region; and 2_ the evaluation whether thrombotic markers and/or the occurrence of overt thrombosis (or disseminated intravascular coagulation) may be prognostic of cancer disease outcomes (i.e. overall survival progression free survival in metastatic cancer disease free survival in limited disease) in cancer patients with different types of solid tumors (i.e. breast lung and gastrointestinal cancers). Therefore the assessment of cancer risk occurrence in healthy individuals might be useful for anticipation of cancer diagnosis. In addition the results of this study might help to evaluate whether thrombotic markers may be prognostic of cancer outcomes independently of the disease extension.    ,NCT02622815

Healthy,Healthy Buddies Manitoba, School-based interventions are generally ineffective for preventing weight gain in children. In 2007 a group from the University of British Columbia developed a program called Healthy Buddies that relied on peer mentors to help young children adopt healthy living behaviours.

Healthy,The NICOLA Recruitment Trial (NICOLA-RT), The Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA) is an opportunity to conduct methodology research relevant to many features of a large prospective study. NICOLA will begin in earnest in Northern Ireland in 2013 and is being conducted by a multidisciplinary team in the Centre for Public Health at Queen's University Belfast. It is an omnibus programme of research on ageing that will continue for at least 10 years and will recruit 8500 middle-aged people in Northern Ireland and follow them into old age providing a comprehensive assessment of their physical and mental health their lifestyles and their social and economic decision making. NICOLA will look at how they perceive disability and health and how this differs between well-off and disadvantaged groups. NICOLA will also study various genetic biological and psychological factors including how participants perceive risk and value their time and the effect of this on their retirement behaviour (including how they manage their money and their health). People over the age of 50 will be invited to take part and asked to complete detailed interviews and questionnaires every 2 years and health assessments every 4 years. The overall aim of this research is to examine the impact of differing invitation letters offered to participants on study recruitment rates.    ,NCT01938898
Healthy,The NICOLA Questionnaire Trial (NICOLA-QT), Recruiting retaining and gathering complete data on participants in research projects be they patients or health professionals can be extremely difficult. These problems increase the risk that research will be abandoned before its true value is appreciated or lead to delays in resolving uncertainty for decision makers while further studies are done. Poor recruitment retention and outcome collection frequently lead to many prospective studies being extended increasing costs. Researchers need to use strategies that are themselves evidence-based. This study proposes to link with an existing longitudinal ageing study called NICOLA to provide evidence on what research participants prefer in relation to providing personal information through a self-completed questionnaire. NICOLA is a large study of people over the age of 50 that is being conducted in Northern Ireland. NICOLA is aiming to recruit 8500 people and will ask them questions about participation in social activities including organised structured and informal activities; relationship quality; loneliness; stress; resilience; quality of life; alcohol intake; food poverty and assess their health and wellbeing. Participants in NICOLA agree to having an interviewer visit them at home to ask questions about their lives complete questionnaires in their own time and attend a health assessment appointment. They also agree to being followed up over a course of at least 10 years. The research described here will examine the impact of differing times and formats of a self assessment questionnaire on completion rates specifically:   -  To assess the effect of being given a questionnaire during a face to face interview with a researcher compared to receiving it by post   -  To explore the potential impact of interview fatigue on completion rates    ,NCT01978522

Healthy,Role of Endothelin-1 in Flow-mediated Dilatation, Endothelial dysfunction of conduit arteries contributes to the increased morbidity and cardiovascular mortality in patients with essential hypertension and appears increasingly as an independent therapeutic target. We have shown previously that besides a decrease in the availability of NO and other endothelium-derived vasodilators factors the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids an increase in the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) may play a role in the pathophysiology of this endothelial dysfunction. Indeed the local concentrations of endothelin-1 during the endothelium-dependent dilation of the radial artery in response to a sustained increase in blood flow decreased significantly in healthy volunteers controls but not in hypertensive patients. This lack of adaptation of the endothelinergic system could be due to a decreased clearance of endothelin-1 by endothelial ETB receptors potentiating the vasoconstrictor action of endothelin-1 mediated by ETA receptor activation at the muscular level. However to validate this hypothesis  it is needed to demonstrate the physiological role of ETA receptor and ETB in sustained flow-mediated dilatation of conduit arteries.    ,NCT02086253
Healthy,Diet Induced Intestinal Mucosal Adaptation, Human beings are 'omnivores' meaning that all principal components of food (i.e. the macronutrients: carbohydrates fat proteins) can be assimilated by the gastrointestinal tract. When the gut mucosa is exposed to dietary changes it adjusts its functional behaviour. For example a fatty diet demands certain digestive mechanisms whereas others are needed to take care of a carbohydrate rich diet. Such dietary induced changes in appearance and functionality of the small intestinal mucosa have been described in animals but only little is known about it in man. The present project aims at elucidating in man if a 2 weeks diet dominated by either fat or carbohydrates but with similar energy content is associated with changes in the small intestinal mucosal appearance and metabolic signalling capacity.    ,NCT02088853

Healthy,Circadian Phase Assessments at Home," An estimated 23 million Americans including adolescents and the elderly suffer from circadian rhythm sleep disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder advanced sleep phase disorder and winter depression. These conditions are characterized by persistent insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness impaired performance reduced well being and lower quality of life. The negative symptoms result from a misalignment between the timing of sleep and the internal circadian clock. Clinical research has demonstrated that circadian rhythm sleep disorders are most effectively diagnosed (differentiated from other causes of insomnia) and treated if each individual patient's circadian phase is known. The timing of the master internal circadian clock is most reliably measured from the onset of the endogenous circadian rhythm of melatonin a neuroendocrine hormone as measured in dim light (dim light melatonin onset or ""DLMO""). However to date the reliable and valid assessment of the DLMO is limited to the research laboratory setting. This study is to test a streamlined procedure for the accurate assessment of circadian phase (DLMO) outside of the laboratory that will provide clinicians and researchers with a novel diagnostic and research tool. In this way the underlying neurobiological cause of a patient's insomnia and/or circadian rhythm disorder can more readily be diagnosed and treated. Specific Aim 1 is to validate procedures for at-home circadian phase assessment in a sample of healthy people. Validation will occur by (1) objectively measuring compliance to the at-home procedures and (2) comparing DLMOs collected at home to DLMOs collected in the laboratory in a within-subjects counterbalanced design. Specific Aim 2 is to validate the same at home procedures in patients with delayed sleep phase disorder. Specific Aim 3 is to conduct rigorous analyses to inform future users which subject characteristics and light levels predict (1) compliance to the at home procedures and (2) valid at-home DLMOs. The results of this 3 year study will have substantial implications for the translation of basic and clinical research to the community: (1) the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders will be significantly enhanced thus improving public health and safety mood and quality of life (2) community participation in research will be improved particularly in vulnerable and under represented populations thus increasing scientific knowledge and (3) research and clinical costs will be substantially reduced.

Healthy,Comparison of Postoperative Outcome of Hepatectomy for Living Donors According to Three Different Incision, Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is an important option for patients with end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation. When performing LDLT the safety and well being of donors is of the utmost importance. The conventional incision for donor hepatectomy is a right subcostal incision with a midline extension up to xiphoid. Minimally invasive liver surgery throughout a single 10 cm upper midline incision without laparoscopic assistance has been widely applied and considered to be safe and effective. Recently laparoscopic and minimally invasive living donor hepatectomy via transverse incision has been suggested to reduce morbidity and the invasiveness of living donor hepatectomy. Although minimally invasive approach has become the surgical method of choice for many transplant centers little data on comparing the impact of all three different type incision in living liver donors. In our center the investigators have adopted three different incision according to surgical teams. The investigators undertook this study with the aims of comparing the pain and quality of life of donors according to type of three different incisions and assessing any benefits to the donor due to the smaller midline incision during the early postoperative period.    ,NCT02413983

Healthy,Effect of a Polyphenol-rich Food Supplement on Cognitive Function in Healthy Aging Adults, Several preliminary studies have shown that diet can have beneficial effects on cognitive decline. Among food shown to have such effects are some polyphenols from selected botanicals. Preclinical studies have concluded that polyphenols play a role in moderation of oxidative stress and inflammation increased neuronal signaling and improved metabolic function among other effects. Noteworthy a positive and statistically significant association between the midlife level of polyphenol intake and cognitive function assessed 13 years later was found in a cohort of 2574 adults. Several mechanisms may be involved in these positive effects of food polyphenols on cognitive function in older adults: experimental studies suggest that polyphenols display neuroprotective effects enhancement of the neuronal function stimulation of brain flow and inducing neurogenesis and might prevent age-related damage to the central nervous system through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Based on these promising results a food supplement from botanicals offering complementary polyphenol profile was developed.

Healthy,Determination of Protein Requirements in Elderly Female Subjects >75 Yrs Old, Minimal data are available on protein requirements throughout the lifespan. Currently available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the nitrogen balance method have been well described. Importantly nitrogen balanced underestimates requirements. The current DRI requirement for healthy adult males is based on the reanalysis of the nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was reanalyzed statistically by Rand et al. and he concluded that the protein requirement of healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83 (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using IAAO the investigators group estimated the protein requirement of young men (mean age 27 years) to be 0.93 and 1.2 g/kg/day (mean and RDA). Currently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition survey conducted by NHANES the authors concluded that adults between the ages of 51 - 70 years old consumed an average on 1.0 g/kg/day (ideal body weight) of protein which represents about 15 % of calories. Depending on the calculations used for ideal body weight some older adults could be getting higher or lower than requirement. There is no scientifically derived protein estimate for older adults.

Healthy,Continuous Adductor Canal Nerve Blocks: Relative Effects of a Basal Infusion v. Hourly Bolus Doses," Patients usually experience moderate-to-severe pain following the knee replacement that is often treated with a femoral nerve block (injection of numbing medicine placed around the main nerve of the knee joint). To make the nerve block last longer a tiny tube is often placed next to the nerve and numbing medicine is infused for multiple days. However while the numbing medicine takes away pain it also decreases sensations muscle strength and proprioception (knowing where the leg is in space without looking at it) which greatly increases the risk of falling. Since falling can be catastrophic following major surgery a femoral nerve blocks are being phased out by surgeons and anesthesiologists. The most-promising replacement is called an adductor canal nerve block. For this new type of block a perineural catheter is inserted into a small canal in the middle of the upper leg. This canal contains the sensory nerve fibers leading to the knee and only a single nerve that serves a relatively small muscle. Multiple studies have demonstrated a dramatic increase in muscle strength using the new adductor canal block compared with the traditional femoral block. However practitioners perceptions of the new block is that it provides insufficient pain control following knee arthroplasty even though all of the sensory nerves affected with the femoral block are also?”theoretically?”affected with the adductor canal block. One reason for this difference may be the small canal of the latter which is a relatively tight area in which the numbing medicine might not spread particularly well (due to pressure from surrounding tissues). One way to possibly counter this issue is by providing repeated boluses of the numbing medicine that will improve the medicine's spread relative to a more-traditional slow continuous (""basal"") infusion. This study seeks to compare these two techniques of medication administration through perineural adductor canal catheters: Our primary aim is to test the hypothesis that for continuous adductor canal blocks providing local anesthetic as repeated hourly bolus doses results in an increased sensory block compared with providing local anesthetic as a continuous basal infusion at an equivalent hourly dose. As a secondary aim we hypothesize that for continuous adductor canal blocks providing local anesthetic as repeated hourly bolus doses results in either equivalent or less motor block compared with providing local anesthetic as a continuous basal infusion at an equivalent hourly dose.

Healthy,Processing of Salient Emotional Stimuli as a Function of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD), Attentional blink refers to a phenomenon where the detection of the second of two target stimuli that are presented in Short succession within a stream of stimuli is impaired. This is explained by an insufficient availability of attentional resources. Additionally emotionally salient stimuli like for example pictures with a positive or negative content are detected more often compared to neutral pictures during this attentional blink period. Cannabinoids are involved in the modulation of cognitive attentional and emotional processes. Interestingly data from animals suggests that THC and CBD both active ingredients in the Cannabis sativa plant have opposing effects on brain cannabinoid (CB1) receptors. CB1 receptors modulate the expression of emotionally salient conditioned association in rats if salience processes in humans are modulated in the same way remains unclear. Employing a task to detect salient stimuli Bhattacharyya et al. (2012) showed that THC seems to make non-salient standard stimuli more salient. They showed decreased activation of the right caudate and increased right prefrontal cortex stimuli during processing of salient stimuli. Importantly this was associated with decreased response times to standard relative to oddball stimuli. Generally THC and CBD differentially modulate brain areas associated with attentional salience processing. For example THC seems to increase prefrontal and striatal activation whereas CBD seems to decrease it. The investigators assume that THC increases the number of correctly detected emotional stimuli during the attentional blink period whereas CBD has no effect. Additionally the investigators assume that pictures of the positive category are detected with higher accuracy than negative ones under the influence of THC.    ,NCT02291536

Healthy,The Influence of Glutamate on Memory in Humans, The hippocampus is particularly laden with n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and is at the same time one of the most important sites in declarative memory. The rationale of this study is that the NMDA partial agonist D-Cycloserine will promote learning compared to a placebo. On the other hand the NMDA receptor antagonist Memantine might lead to reduced memory. We believe that the influence of NMDA receptors on memory can be determined via acute co-activation of the NMDA receptors with CycloserineÂ® (King Pharmaceuticals Ltd active ingredient: DCycloserin dose: 250 mg) and Memantine (AxuraÂ® Merz active ingredient: Memantine dose: 20 mg)on both a behavioral and functional (fMRI) level.    ,NCT00980408

Healthy,Could Meditation Modulate the Neurobiology of Learning Not to Fear?, It is well-established that the practice of mindfulness meditation leads to improvements in mental health and well-being and the cultivation of positive emotions. However the neural mechanisms of these improvements are largely unknown. A few recent studies suggest that mindfulness meditation impacts the structure and function of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex the hippocampus and the amygdala. Interestingly recent studies have shown that these regions are part of a brain circuit that is critical for the extinction of conditioned fear responses and for the retention of fear extinction memory. Building on the overlap of these regions and on conceptual considerations the project investigates whether mindfulness meditation could influence one's capacity to retain the memory of fear extinction. Meditation-naÃ¯ve participants will be randomized to either a mindfulness-meditation based training or an active control training that controls for all mindfulness-unspecific components. Participants will undergo a fear conditioning extinction and extinction recall protocol in an MRI scanner before and after the trainings. We hypothesize that participants who have practiced mindfulness meditation will show greater improvements in fear extinction memory after the course and that these improvements will be correlated with anatomical and functional changes in the brain regions of interest. Improvements in fear extinction memory will also be related to improvements in self-reported psychological well-being. Merging the fields of an ancient spiritual tradition and a fundamental learning mechanism the project investigates the underlying neural mechanisms of a practice for the enhancement of mental health and well-being.    ,NCT01320969

Healthy,Fluoride Intake From Toothbrushig With Children's or Regular Toothpastes, There are controversial data about fluoride intake by children when tooth brushing with children's or regular toothpastes. However a study have showed that children were exposed to a dose of 0.051 mg F/Kg/day and 0.046 mg F/kg/day by tooth brushing with children's and and regular toothpaste respectively. Fluorides doses were too close and is questioned if there is a real clinical relevance in terms of risk of dental fluorosis. It is important to evaluate if children's toothpastes does really represent a risk of fluoride intake when compared to the regular toothpastes in terms of risk of dental fluorosis. The hypothesis is that both children's and regular toothpastes can represente risks of development of dental fluorosis and can represent similar fluoride exposure by children.    ,NCT01568541

Healthy,Circadian Variation of Cardiac Troponin, Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is defined by an increase and/or decrease in the concentration of cardiac troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile value of the reference population together with evidence of ischemia. An objective tool to determine the magnitude of the cardiac troponin change is the use of reference change values (RCV). The basis for this tool is that for a change to be significant the difference in serial results must be greater than the inherent variation in two test results. The inherent variation of a laboratory test result is composed of analytical and within-subject biological variation. An important requirement to use RCVs is that the concentrations of cardiac troponins fluctuate randomly around a homeostatic set point in cardio-healthy individuals. Verification of this important condition has never been performed and violation of this condition would preclude the use of RCV's in clinical practice.    ,NCT02091427

Healthy,The Influence of Aircraft Noise Exposure on Renal Hemodynamic in Healthy Individuals, Epidemiological studies have found a link between aircraft noise exposure and increased incidence of arterial hypertension and thus cardiovascular disease. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The kidney acts as a long-term regulator of blood pressure and controls the extracellular sodium and water balance. Significant renal mechanisms of blood pressure regulation are the renin angiotensin system renal sympathetic activity and sodium excretion. Animal work and clinical studies show that mental stress affects the renal plasma flow and urinary sodium excretion. The investigators observed a lower sodium excretion in situations of mental stress in subjects at risk for developing arterial hypertension. In healthy volunteers a 30-minute mental stress test resulted in increased glomerular filtration rate filtration fraction and an increase in urinary sodium excretion. In this pilot study the investigators analyzed the influence of 30 minutes standardized aircraft noise on renal and central hemodynamics.    ,NCT02783456

Healthy,Improving Rotavirus Vaccine Immune Response, Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide and is estimated to account for 600000 deaths in children <5 years of age. However live oral enteric vaccines (e.g. OPV cholera vaccines typhoid vaccine) have been less immunogenic in poor communities with high levels of malnutrition and poor sanitation. Rotavirus vaccines also appear to be less immunogenic in the setting where they are most needed. High maternal antibody (IgG) to rotavirus and breast feeding near the time of vaccination may inhibit rotavirus vaccine effectiveness. We propose a quick study to look at practical ways to improve the immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccine in our own setting in Bangladesh.

Healthy,Effects of Intranasal Administration of a Single Dose of Oxytocin Using a Novel Device in Healthy Adults, Oxytocin (OT) is a small naturally occurring peptide currently in clinical use to stimulate lactation in breastfeeding women. The intranasal administration of OT has recently attracted attention as a potential novel treatment in several psychiatric disorders including autism. However given the anatomy of the nasal cavity the current design of nasal sprays would be expected to provide an inadequate delivery of medication to the areas of the nasal cavity where direct transport into the brain via the olfactory nerve could potentially occur. OptiNose has developed an intranasal delivery device that provides improved reproducibility of nasal delivery improved deposition to the upper posterior regions of the nasal cavity where the olfactory nerve innervates the nasal cavity. The primary objective of this study is to identify any differences between single dose 8 or 24 international units (IU) oxytocin delivered intranasally with the optimised OptiNose device and 1 IU oxytocin administered as slow intravenous infusion in healthy volunteers. This will be measured in terms of brain activity as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) performance on cognitive tests and physiological markers.    ,NCT01983514

Healthy,Determination of Protein Requirement in Elderly Male Subjects >75 Yrs Old, Minimal data are available on protein requirements throughout the lifespan. Currently available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the nitrogen balance method have been well described. Importantly nitrogen balanced underestimates requirements. The current dietary reference intake (DRI) requirement for healthy adult males is based on the reanalysis of the nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was reanalyzed statistically by Rand et al. and he concluded that the protein requirement of healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83 (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using IAAO our group estimated the protein requirement of young men (mean age 27 years) to be 0.93 and 1.2 g/kg/day (mean and RDA). Currently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition survey conducted by national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) the authors concluded that adults between the ages of 51 - 70 years old consumed an average on 1.0 g/kg/day (ideal body weight) of protein which represents about 15 % of calories. Depending on the calculations used for ideal body weight some older adults could be getting higher or lower than requirement. There is no scientifically derived protein estimate for older adults. Therefore there is a need to measurer protein requirement in that population. The goal of this study therefore is to measure the protein requirement of male elderly subjects > 75 years using the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize the protein requirement in elderly male subjects will be lower (0.85-1.05 g/kg/day) than that established in young healthy males ( 0.93 - 1.2g/kg/day).    ,NCT01948492

Healthy,Effects of Lacosamide on Human Motor Cortex Excitability: a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Study, This study has been designed to explore dose-depended effects of lacosamide (LCM) on motor cortex excitability with TMS in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial in young healthy human subjects and to compare the pattern of excitability changes induced by LCM with those of carbamazepine (CBZ). LCM selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channel and in contrast to CBZ does not affect steady-state fast inactivation (Errington et al. 2006). The enhancement of slow inactivation of sodium channels by LCM is a novel manner to modulate sodium channels and leads to normalization of activation thresholds and a reduced pathophysiological hyper-responsiveness thereby effectively controlling neuronal hyperexcitability without affecting physiological activity (Beyreuther et al. 2007). Therefore it is thought that LCM compared to CBZ will be better tolerated in clinical settings while being as or even more effective in controlling seizure activity. On the basis of the results from nonhuman studies it is hypothesized that the TMS profile of LCM will be distinguishable from that of CBZ. CBZ like other 'classical' sodium channel blockers such as phenytoin predominantly demonstrated elevated TMS motor thresholds indicating reduced neuronal membrane excitability without developing significant changes of synaptic intracortical inhibition and facilitation (Ziemann et al. 1996; Chen et al. 1997; Lee et al. 2005). Because of its novel mode of action it can only be speculated which TMS parameters LCM might affect. For example more than exclusively affecting neuronal membrane excitability LCM could possibly also affect inhibitory mechanisms such as short- and long-latency intracortical inhibition (Valls-Sole et al. 1992; Kujirai et al. 1993). This would in line with other well-tolerated modern antiepileptic drugs (Ziemann et al. 1996; Reis et al. 2002; Lang et al. 2006).    ,NCT01382017

Healthy,ITF2984 Repeated Doses Study in Healthy Volunteers, This was a within group randomised repeated dose placebo- and octreotide controlled study in a target population of 45 healthy male subjects. Subjects were required to attend the clinical for screening procedures between 3 and 28 days before dosing commenced. The study was conducted in 4 groups of subjects; Groups 1 to 3 were a double-blinded randomised design each consisting of 12 subjects. Group 4 was an open-label design and consisted of 9 subjects. There was a minimum interval of 96 h between dosing of Groups 1 2 and 3 to allow for interim analyses of PK and safety/tolerability data for dose escalation purposes. Group 4 (the active control group) was still to proceed if the decision was taken to prematurely stop dosing with ITF2984 (somatostatin analogue) following review of the PK and safety data presented at the interim decision meeting; dosing of this group was conducted independently from Groups 1 to 3. On Days 1 to 6 subjects in Groups 1 to 3 were to receive 2 doses of investigational medicinal product (IMP) approximately 12 h apart; subjects in Group 4 were to receive 3 doses of IMP approximately 8 h apart. For all groups subjects were scheduled to receive their final dose of IMP on the morning of Day 7. In addition subjects were to receive exogenous test administrations(stimulation test) on Day -1 Day 1 and Day 7 at the same time on each day (ie for Day -1 23.5 h before the first dose of IMP and for Days 1 and 7 0.5 h after the first dose of IMP on the respective day). Blood samples for PD and PK analyses were taken at specified time points after each dosing. Subjects remained on site for 10 days (ie 36 h after the final dose of IMP on Day 7) providing that discharge conditions had been met and returned to the clinic between 5 and 10 days after the last IMP administration for a follow-up visit.    ,NCT01871844
Healthy,The Influence of Oxytocin on the Processing of Social Contact, Social touch can convey the most potent and salient of socio-emotional signals. While the hypothalamic peptide oxytocin (OXT) has been identified as a key neurochemical mediator of grooming in some other social species its modulatory influence on human interpersonal touch is unknown. The investigators expect that OXT augments the hedonic value of touch and that this behavioral effect is paralleled at the neural level by an increased response in brain areas mediating rewarding aspects of social touch.    ,NCT01939639

Healthy,Cerebral Blood Flow and PETCO2 on Neuromuscular Function During Environmental Stress, Environmental stress such as low oxygen availability (hypoxia) has been associated with impaired neuromuscular performance; however the mechanisms associated with these performance decrements remain unclear. While the majority of research suggests that the observed fatigue is related to the central nervous system the influence of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and associated changes in cerebral pH (partial pressure of carbon dioxide; PCO2) remains unexamined. In response to hypoxic stress humans hyperventilate to maintain oxygen consumption resulting in a hypocapnia mediated decrease in CBF and cerebral alkalosis (decreased PCO2). Previous research suggests that hyperventilation induces changes in neural excitability and synaptic transmission; however it remains unclear if these changes are related to hypocapnia mediated decrease in CBF or cerebral alkalosis or both. The purpose of the proposed research program is to examine the influence of changes in CBF and cerebral alkalosis on neuromuscular function during environmental stress. The research program will consist of 2 separate projects summarized below in a table outlining the proposed protocols and resultant physiological manipulations. During each manipulation neuromuscular function will be evaluated and compared to baseline (normoxic) conditions using a repeated measures design. The research program will consist of 2 separate projects. Project 1 will examine the changes in CBF and alkalosis by using (a) indomethacin (decrease CBF; no change PCO2) and (b) hypocapnia (decrease CBF; decrease PCO2). Using a similar experimental design Project 2 will examine the change in CBF and alkalosis during hypoxia by using (a) poikilocapnic hypoxia (decrease PO2; decrease CBF; decrease PCO2) (b) isocapnic hypoxia (decrease PO2; no change CBF; no change PCO2) and (c) isocapnic hypoxia + indomethacin (decrease PO2; decrease CBF; no change PCO2). During each manipulation neuromuscular function will be evaluated and compared to baseline (normoxic) conditions using a repeated measures design. Therefore Project 1 will examine the separate and combined effect of changes in CBF and cerebral alkalosis on neuromuscular function independent of environmental manipulations. Subsequently Project 2 will examine neuromuscular function during hypoxia while controlling CBF and cerebral alkalosis. It is hypothesized that changes in PCO2 and therefore changes in cerebral alkalosis will contribute to neuromuscular fatigue independent of changes in CBF and oxygen availability.    ,NCT01830335

Healthy,The Influence of Cerebral Blood Flow and PETCO2 on Neuromuscular Function During Passive Heat Stress, Increased core temperature (hyperthermia) has been associated with impaired neuromuscular performance; however the mechanisms associated with these performance decrements and their potential synergies remain unclear. While the majority of research suggests that the observed fatigue is related to the central nervous system the influence of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and associated changes in cerebral alkalosis (estimated by end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide; PETCO2) remains unexamined. In response to hyperthermia humans hyperventilate as means of heat dissipation resulting in a hypocapnia (reduced PETCO2) mediated decrease in CBF and consequently cerebral alkalosis (increased cerebral pH). Previous research suggests that hyperventilation induces changes in neural excitability and synaptic transmission; however it remains unclear if these changes are related to hypocapnia mediated decrease in CBF or decreased PETCO2 or both. The purpose of the proposed research program is to examine the influence of changes in CBF and cerebral alkalosis on neuromuscular function during passive heat stress. The research project will consist of 3 separate experimental trials: (a) poikilocapnic hyperthermia (increased core temperature; decrease CBF; decrease PETCO2) (b) isocapnic hyperthermia (increased core temperature; no change CBF; no change PETCO2) and (c) isocapnic hyperthermia + indomethacin (increased core temperature; decrease CBF; no change PETCO2). During each manipulation neuromuscular function will be evaluated and compared to baseline (normothermic) conditions using a repeated measures design. It is hypothesized that changes in PETCO2 and therefore changes in cerebral alkalosis will contribute to neuromuscular fatigue independent of changes in CBF or increases in core temperature.    ,NCT01848665

Healthy,Determination of Protein Requirement in Elderly Male Subjects 65-75 Yrs Old., Minimal data are available on protein requirements throughout the lifespan. Currently available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the nitrogen balance method have been well described. Importantly nitrogen balanced underestimates requirements. The current dietary reference intakes (DRI) requirement for healthy adult males is based on the reanalysis of the nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was reanalyzed statistically by Rand et al. and he concluded that the protein requirement of healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83 (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) our group estimated the protein requirement of young men (mean age 27 years) to be 0.93 and 1.2 g/kg/day (mean and RDA). Currently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition survey conducted by national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) the authors concluded that adults between the ages of 51 - 70 years old consumed an average on 1.0 g/kg/day (ideal body weight) of protein which represents about 15 % of calories. Depending on the calculations used for ideal body weight some older adults could be getting higher or lower than requirement. There is no scientifically derived protein estimate for older adults. Therefore there is a need to measurer protein requirement in that population. The goal of this study therefore is to measure the protein requirement of male elderly subjects between the ages of 65 - 75 years using the IAAO technique.    ,NCT01943266

Healthy,Effects of Cranberry Consumption in Vascular Function in Healthy Individuals, Accumulating evidence from epidemiological and human intervention studies indicates that the cardiovascular health benefits of diets rich in fruits and vegetables are (in part) related to their (poly)phenol content. Cranberries are rich in (poly)phenols compounds in particular anthocyanins but also phenolic acids. At present a small number of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of berry (poly)phenols on validated surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease risk has shown promising results. However to date very few human studies have specifically investigated the effects of cranberry (poly)phenols on cardiovascular function in healthy subjects. To our knowledge no study has investigated the time and intake-dependent effect of cranberry consumption on vascular function in healthy subjects. This information is necessary for the planning of long-term studies aiming to assess the potential beneficial effects of cranberries using optimal amounts at optimal time points. Therefore this study aims to investigate the potential role of cranberry (poly)phenols in the modulation of vascular function by monitoring changes in vascular function together with the major (poly)phenol derivatives/metabolites in plasma and urine.    ,NCT02517775

Healthy,Urinary Excretion of Acetylamantadine by Normal Healthy Volunteers, Amantadine appears to be a specific substrate for acetylation by spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT). SSAT activity in cancer cells is higher by several-fold compared to normal cells. Amantadine can be used to determine SSAT cellular activity and may indicate the presence of cancer. This study will provide additional information in conjunction with data from a previous study which include cancer patients and normal health age matched controls to determine whether urinary excretion of acetylamantadine is predictive for the presence of cancer and if so whether excretion of this metabolite is associated with any particular site of the tumor. Based on the results of the first study additional data in normal healthy volunteers is required. The data from both studies will be analyzed to account for subject gender stage of disease at time of testing concurrent diseases alcohol and tobacco use and occupational characteristics. This is an important first step in validating a cancer detection method that can be implemented economically for screening of large numbers of people at sites remote from limited and expensive diagnostic instrumentation.

Healthy,Usability and Reliability of a New Physical Therapy Tool," Rehabilitation exercise conducted at home following injury improves clinical and functional outcomes. Optimum compliance with prescribed exercise regimens requires regular patient instruction performance assessment monitoring and general encouragement from healthcare staff. Exercise at home though convenient for patients is not conducive for provision of the professional support needed to maximize prescribed regimen effectiveness. Software in development by Reflexion Health Inc. along with the Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) is being designed to facilitate remote staff-patient interaction during at-home rehabilitative exercise sessions. Microsoft KinectÂ® will serve as the hardware platform for the designed software package tentatively called ""Reflexion."" KinectÂ® contains a marker-less/controller-less motion tracking camera. The final Reflexion software will rely on a ""Rehabilitation Measurement Tool (RMT)"" to detect cardinal plane skeletal joint movement and its velocity utilizing the embedded KinectÂ® camera while also providing patient visual feedback via an avatar on a television screen. In this observational minimal risk study RMT/KinectÂ® functional reliability and usability will be assessed. Twenty healthy subjects will physically set-up and turn-on the hardware/software system; receive exercise directions from the RMT; then conduct a series of knee exercises similar to those prescribed after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair. An initial limited data set obtained by Reflexion Health provided validity and reliability measures. Eighteen degrees of absolute difference was detected between manual goniometry and KinectÂ® measurements in relevant planes of movement utilized during prescribed ACL exercise. Good relative agreement between RMT and goniometry scores was obtained (ICC = 0.89). A correctable systematic bias toward underestimation by the RMT will allow for future more accurate estimations of joint positioning improving face validity. RMT functional reliability and general usability will be expressed in this study utilizing descriptive statistics and scaled questionnaires. Hardware component malfunction (KinectÂ® camera laptop PC or LCD television/monitor) as well as RMT internally logged software errors and failure will tallied and measured to ascertain RMT reliability. User-RMT interaction quality will be evaluated with video recordings of each set-up and exercise session. Specifically usability measures will include: need for additional assistance setting-up or operating the RMT; number of attempts required by the subject to interact with a specific feature: time spent on specific elements during the session. Participant feedback will be elicited post-session using two scaled questionnaires: System Usability Scale (SUS)and Reflexion Usability Scale (RUS). Findings from the study will guide software modifications needed prior to implementation of future clinical studies within the NMCSD population.    ",NCT01727856

Healthy,Ferrous Fumarate and Ferric Pyrophosphate as Food Fortificants in Developing Countries, Iron fortification of foods is usually considered the most cost-effective approach to prevent iron deficiency. However iron is the most difficult mineral to add to foods. When added as water-soluble highly bioavailable compounds such as ferrous sulfate the soluble iron rapidly catalyzes fat oxidation resulting in rancid products. In addition water-soluble iron compounds can cause unacceptable color reactions during storage and food preparation. Thus food manufacturers are often obliged to use water-insoluble iron compounds to fortify foods and fortification compounds such as elemental Fe powder and ferric pyrophosphate are widely used to fortify cereal flours and infant cereals. However these compounds never dissolve completely in the gastric juice and are usually far less well absorbed than ferrous sulfate (Hurrell 1997). Ferrous fumarate on the other hand although almost insoluble in water readily dissolves in the gastric juice and has been shown to have an equivalent absorption to ferrous sulfate in healthy Western adults (Hurrell et al. 1989 2000). Because it is non-water soluble it causes relatively few sensory problems in the fortified foods and is therefore an interesting food fortificant. Iron absorption from ferrous fumarate has been demonstrated to be significantly higher than from ferric pyrophosphate in European infants (Davidsson et al. 2000) and this compound is currently used to fortify blended cereal flours for food aid programs and commercial infant cereals in Europe. However based on our recent study in Bangladeshi children there is now concern that due to lower gastric acid output young children in developing countries may not be able to absorb ferrous fumarate as well as Western adults (Davidsson et al. 2001a Sarker et al. 2001 2003). Clearly there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of water insoluble iron compounds to prevent the development of iron deficiency/iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children living in developing countries. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ferrous fumarate and ferric pyrophosphate as compared to ferrous sulfate as food fortificants in preventing development of anemia/IDA in Bangladeshi infants and young children (part I). A potential cause of low gastric acid secretion in Bangladesh and many developing countries is Helicobacter pylori infection. Although H. pylori-infection appeared to have no influence on absorption of ferrous fumarate in children the impact of chronic H. pylori infection in adults could be expected to be more pronounced due to long time effects on the gastric mucosa resulting in reduced gastric acid output. The other aim of the study is therefore to assess of iron absorption and gastric acid output in adult women of child-bearing age with H. pylori infection (part II). Two hundred and forty non-anemic Children (Hb>105 g/L) will be randomized to three study groups; ferrous fumarate ferric pyrophosphate or ferrous sulfate (n=80 per group) in wheat flour- and cow milk-based infant formula and will be fed for 9 months. Hemoglobin serum ferritin and transferin receptor will be analyzed at baseline and after 4.5 and 9 months of intervention. Prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency during and after the intervention among the three groups will be compared (part I). We furthermore propose a complementary study to determine the relative absorption of ferrous fumarate (relative to ferrous sulfate) in H. pylori infected and non-infected adult Bangladeshi women (15 each) of 20-40 year of age with IDA using stable isotope technique based on the incorporation of iron stable isotopes into erythrocytes 14 days after administration. Assessment of gastric acid output will also be performed. Iron stature and absorption and assessment of gastric acid output will be compared before and after therapy in H. pylori infected women (part II). The results of this study are expected to have implications in the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia in developing countries    ,NCT00867867

The fondue will be labeled with non-radioactive 13C octanoate for assessment of gastric emptying by breath-test.    ,NCT00943696
Healthy,Renal Salt Handling in Postural Tachycardia Syndrome Following Dietary Dopa Administration, The purpose of this study is to learn how plants can play a role in gain/loss of sodium in the urine and in the regulation of blood pressure.

Healthy,Ultrasonography Detection of Local Twitch Response During Dry Needling, Background: One treatment of Muscle trigger points (MTrPs) is deep dry needling (DN) with the purpose of obtaining local twitch responses (LTRs) which are highly effective in releasing MTrPs. In DN procedures the mechanisms associated with LTRs and the LTR intensities required for optimal clinical results are poorly understood especially in relation to range of motion after intervention. Therefore evaluating the intensity of LTRs is relevant for implementing DN in different clinical settings such as in patients with muscular or neurological dysfunctions. One way to assess muscle contractions and LTRs is through ultrasound video analysis. The aim of this report was to evaluate the reliability of semi-automatic LTR intensities tracking during dry needling by assessing ultrasound signals with an image processing method in addition to evaluating the relationship between LTR intensities and muscle elasticity. Method: Young males without signs or symptoms of musculoskeletal pain were included. Primary outcome measure was the LTR intensities determined by percentage change of muscle thickness. The secondary outcome measures were the muscle elasticity of medial gastrocnemius and hamstring previous and posterior DN in both lower limbs for each subject. Three LTRs detected by a physical therapist and ultrasound assessment were induced by inserting a filament needle into muscle latent trigger points in medial gastrocnemius. The intensities of LTRs were measured by assessing ultrasound images using an optical flow method and through comparisons with manual detection.    ,NCT02824991
Healthy,EIT Study With Healthy Patients, Patients with severe respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) can benefit from having non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Non-invasive ventilation consists of a machine (ventilator) that is blowing air through a mask. NIV provides patients with a bigger expansion of their lung when they are breathing. This better expansion helps patients to have more oxygen and less waste gas (or carbon dioxide) in their body. These improvements enhance survival and quality of life. In order to provide appropriate ventilation for each patient the ventilator can generate different types of blowing:   -  Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which delivers a constant pressure to the mask   -  Pressure support ventilation (PSV) which delivers a constant pressure to the mask and on top of that delivers more pressure when the patient begins to breathe in.   -  Pressure control ventilation (PCV) which is similar to PSV but use a fixed time to generate the flow when the patient begins to breathe in. These different types of blowing have consequences on patient comfort as well as on the improvement of their ventilation. To assess the improvement of the ventilation the investigators currently use blood tests however these reflect overall output and may miss more subtle changes in breathing that could affect how patients feel. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a new technology that involves wearing a belt of sensors around the chest that provides information on how well the lungs are being filled with air by the ventilator. It allows a non-invasive assessment of the effect of NIV onto lung ventilation in real-time. The investigators hope to use the EIT technology to assess in real-time patients lung ventilation when they are using the NIV. The investigators hope that EIT will provide them with information on which type of blowing is more effective and more comfortable than the others.    ,NCT02828007

HIV,Seroprevalence of Chikungunya at the End of the First Chikungunya Outbreak in the French Antilles Within a Sample of Patients Treated for a HIV Infection, Late 2013 the first indigenous cases of chikungunya have been observed in the French Antilles. At the end of May 2014 almost all of the islands of the Caribbean were affected by the outbreak. During the large epidemic which affected the Island of La RÃ©union in 2005/2006 the attack rate was 38%. The most active period was three months. In this context knowledge of the attack rate and the epidemic in the Caribbean is an important issue for outbreak management and modeling work. As the chikungunya virus had never circulated in the Caribbean determining the seroconversion rate can be achieved by realizing a seroprevalence survey among the general population at the end of the outbreak. Another simple method is to estimate the rate in a cohort of patients followed regularly and whose habitat is distributed throughout the territory studied. The follow up of patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the French West Indies is almost exclusively performed in hospitals in department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases.The high prevalence of HIV and homogeneous distribution of infected patients on all of our territories allow to hypothesize that the risk of transmission of arboviruses by exposure to mosquito bites is comparable to the general population. This patient cohort is well suited to study the emergence of Chikungunya in the French West Indie . Primary objective : To estimate the cumulative incidence at the end of the first Chikungunya outbreak in the French West Indies by estimating the prevalence of specific antibodies of chikungunya virus in a sample (randomly constituted) from patients infected by HIV and representative of the general population of Martinique and Guadeloupe Secondary objective : To estimate the frequency of asymptomatic infections by the chikungunya virus in the studied population To estimate the frequency of chronic forms of chikungunya in the studied population    ,NCT02553369

HIV,Understanding HIV Susceptibility in the Female Genital Tract, There is great variability in susceptibility from one person to another and less than one in a hundred sexual exposures to HIV results in infection. In addition some recent trial of methods to prevent HIV - including vaccines and microbicides - have actually increased HIV acquisition among trial participants for reasons that we do not fully understand. While we know that immune differences in the genital lining are an important determinant of whether a person is infected after a sexual HIV exposure we don't know enough about these differences to be able to accurately assess a person's individual HIV risk. Therefore the development of safe and non-invasive laboratory tests to estimate a person's susceptibility in the genital tract would be useful in clinical studies of new HIV prevention tools.    ,NCT03064425

DREAM Study, A phase IV multicentre randomised open-label pilot clinical trial designed to evaluate HIV-infected aviremic patients who receive treatment with the combination of DTG/3TC/ABC and who have neuropsychiatric adverse effects that in the opinion of the investigators may be related to taking DTG/3TC/ABC if they improve after switching antiretroviral therapy to the combination of ELV/COBI/FTC/TAF.    ,NCT03067285
HIV,Improving Identification of Mental Health/Substance Use Disorders in HIV Primary Care: Pilot Clinical Response, This research is a feasibility pilot of an intervention to respond to positive screening tests for mental health(MH) and substance use (SU) captured through the Patient Reported Outcomes questionnaires (PROs). The PROs are currently performed in the clinic however the results are neither reviewed with patients nor transmitted to providers. This pilot assesses the feasibility of moving the PROs into the clinical realm by having patients review the PRO results identifying an issue to discuss at the patient's next HIV primary care visit and determining whether this process increases discussion of MH and SU disorders in the subsequent clinical visit and/or increases referrals to MH and/or SU treatment.    ,NCT03067948
HIV,PrEP Implementation for Mothers in Antenatal Care, In a region with 15-20% HIV prevalence an estimated 20% of HIV-uninfected women could have HIV exposures in pregnancy. In a theoretical scenario of perfect PrEP coverage all women at risk receive PrEP while no women not at HIV risk receive PrEP (Figure 4). With mandatory PrEP given to all women (similar to the approaches used for malaria prophylaxis) all women at risk would be covered but many women not at risk receive unnecessary PrEP. Our premise is that a targeted PrEP model may be closer to perfect coverage than a universal offer/self-select model. Implementing targeted PrEP through strategies that include facilitation of partner testing with self-tests could add HIV prevention benefit by increasing partner HIV diagnosis and treatment similar to the initiation of PrEP among pregnant women. By implementing these strategies and measuring uptake process and HIV incidence we can inform the best health systems model for PrEP delivery in pregnancy.    ,NCT03070600
HIV,Men's Club: Impact of Male Partner Involvement on Initiation and Sustainment of Exclusive Breastfeeding Among Postpartum Women, Breastfeeding remains the optimal mode of feeding for infants younger than six months. Exclusive Breast Feeding (EBF) among HIV-infected mothers has been shown to be associated with a sustained and significant reduction in HIV transmission and has the potential to reduce infant and under-five mortality. Given the considerable authority among men as decision makers in sub-Saharan African we may be witnessing a missed opportunity to engage men in the education awareness and decision-making for EBF. Understanding the role and impact of male partners on this decision-making process require further examination to inform the development of effective and sustainable evidence-based interventions to support the initiation and sustainment of EBF.    ,NCT03072758

HIV,CC-11050 in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1-Infected Adults With Suppressed Plasma Viremia on Antiretroviral Therapy (APHRODITE), Background: When there is a threat to the body the immune system triggers inflammation. Too much inflammation can damage the body or cause painful symptoms. Some people with HIV feel sick after they start HIV drugs because their recovering immune systems cause too much inflammation. Or their immune systems can become activated all the time. This can cause serious health problems. Researchers want to test if the drug CC-11050 helps treat inflammation in people taking HIV drugs. Objectives: To test if CC-11050 is safe and well-tolerated for people with HIV who are taking HIV drugs. To see if it reduces inflammation. Eligibility: People ages 18 and older with HIV who have been on antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year. Design: Participants will be screened with: Medicine review Physical exam and medical history Blood and urine tests Chest x-ray Electrocardiogram (ECG): Soft electrodes on the skin record heart signals. Participants will be randomly assigned to take capsules of either CC-11050 or a placebo. They will take the capsules every day for 12 weeks. They will continue to take their HIV drugs. Participants will have a baseline visit within 2 months of screening. This includes: Physical exam and medical history Blood and urine tests ECG Leukapheresis: Blood is removed by a needle in one arm and passed through a machine that removes white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. Participants will have follow-up visits 2 4 8 12 and 16 weeks after the baseline visit. These may include repeats of some of the baseline tests.    ,NCT02652546
HIV,Dual Therapy With Raltegravir and Darunavir/Ritonavir in HIV Infected Patients., While 3-drug regimens remain standard of care concerns exist regarding the safety of multi-drug regimens taken for a lifetime. Problems with nucleoside analogue therapy prompted successful trials with ritonavir (RTV) boosted PI monotherapy however long term safety and efficacy of such regimens remains unknown. Clinical trials have shown Raltegravir (RAL) to have potent activity when patients have few active background drugs; it has a superior lipid profile compared with EFV and LPV/RTV. Darunavir/r (DRV) is a potent well tolerated PI with few GI side effects and lipid disturbances and with a high genetic barrier. The investigators hypothesized that RAL/DRV would be a well tolerated and effective regimen for those patients who are failing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors based regimens due to poor tolerability or resistance. The investigators also would like to explore the plasma pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir combined with Darunavir in a sub-group of 12 HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT01258374
HIV,Combination of Insulin Sensitizer and Leptin as Treatment for the HAART -Induced Metabolic Syndrome, The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with HIV lipodystrophy (fat wasting) benefit from taking the combination of two drugs one insulin sensitizer (either metformin or pioglitazone both diabetes drugs) and leptin (a natural hormone produced by your fat cells). Our hope is that they will improve sugar and fat metabolism and positively affect the body fat changes you have noticed while taking HAART.    ,NCT00362440
HIV,Effects of Short-term Growth Hormone in HIV-infected Patients, The purpose of this study is to examine the short-term effects of two different doses of growth hormone compared to treatment with growth hormone releasing hormone on the brain's secretion of growth hormone and the body's glucose metabolism. We hypothesize that growth hormone administration will alter the body's endogenous pulsatile growth hormone secretion and that higher dose growth hormone may decrease insulin sensitivity. We hypothesize that growth hormone releasing hormone will augment endogenous GH pulsatility and be neutral to insulin sensitivity.    ,NCT00795210

HIV,Leptin for Abnormal Lipid Kinetics in HIV Lipodystrophy Syndrome," ""HIV lipodystrophy syndrome"" (HLS) is characterized by loss of fat in the arms and legs with increase in fat in the abdomen and abnormal blood lipid levels. Persons with HLS have high risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome. The investigators have previously shown that the abnormal lipid levels and lipodystrophy in HLS are associated with defective regulation of lipid metabolic rates specifically accelerated lipolysis (breakdown of stored fats) and decreased fat oxidation (utilization of fats for energy). Patients with HLS also have low levels of the hormone leptin. The investigators hypothesize that treatment of these patients with leptin will improve fat oxidation and may slow the rate of lipolysis. Hence the investigators propose to study the effect of leptin therapy on lipid metabolic rates and lipid and glucose levels in adults with HLS. The investigators will use state of the art stable isotope tracer techniques and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) to measure lipolysis fat oxidation and fat re-esterification in adipose tissues and liver.

HIV,Immune Response to Pneumococcal Vaccination in Aging HIV Positive Adults, The investigators hypothesized that pneumococcal vaccination with either the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine PPV-23 (Pneumovax-23) alone or the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV-13 (Prevnar-13) followed by PPV-23 results in a similar antibody levels/functional antibody activity and induce similar pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS)-specific B cell response in HIV positive individuals > 50 years of age HIV positive individuals 21-40 years of age as compared to HIV negative > 50 years of age. The investigators immunized the study groups HIV+ persons >50 HIV+ persons 21-40 and controls (HIV negative) with PCV 13 followed by PPV23 and HIV>50 with PPV alone and examined immune responses to polysaccharide (PPS) 23 (F)14 3 7 (F) and 19 (A) using polysaccharide specific ELISA and opsonophagocytic assays (OPA). Pre- and post-immunization peripheral blood samples were obtained. Extensive B cell phenotype analysis using fluorescent antibodies was used to characterize PPS-labeled B cells. Specific phenotypes were correlated with antibody levels and OPA and compared to populations immunized with PPV    ,NCT03039491
HIV,Intervention Targeting Medication Adherence and Methamphetamine Use in HIV Positive Men (ACE), The primary aim is to test an innovative 8-session intervention based on Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Skills-Training for the co-occurrence of methamphetamine use and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) non-adherence among methamphetamine using HIV+ MSM in NYC compared to an 8-session educational (ED) condition.

HIV,Immune Responses to Two Experimental HIV Vaccines in Healthy Adults, Background: The primary focus of the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the NIH is to develop vaccines for HIV/AIDS. The main purpose of this study is to look in detail at the body s immune response to two experimental HIV vaccines currently in development at the VRC. One is known as the rAd5 vaccine and the other is known as the DNA vaccine. These vaccines are made with pieces of manufactured DNA. They do not contain live or killed HIV. It is impossible for study vaccines to give you HIV and they cannot cause you to give HIV to someone else. Both of these experimental vaccines have been given to people before in other research studies. They have not been approved for treating or preventing HIV infection. Purpose: The main purpose of this study is to look in detail at the body s immune responses after the experimental HIV vaccines are given and to assess safety of the study vaccines. Eligibility: Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 50 who are not infected with HIV and who meet the eligibility requirements. Design: Participants will be screened with a medical history (including questions about sexual history and drug use) physical exam and blood tests. The study will have two groups: <TAB>One group will receive one injection of the rAd5 vaccine and have 8 clinic visits over 3 months. <TAB>The second group will have three injections of the DNA vaccine one injection of the rAd5 vaccine and have 12 clinic visits over 6 months. All participants will be asked to provide blood and body fluid samples for testing during the study. Payment for participation will be provided.    ,NCT01386489
HIV,Safety Tolerabilityand Adherence to Co-formulated Tenofovir-emtricitabine-rilpivirine Used as HIV Nonoccupational Post-exposure Prophylaxis in Men Who Have Sex With Men., This study aims to describe the safety tolerability and adherence to the coformulated anti-HIV drug tenofovir-emtricitabine-rilpivirine (eviplera) when given to men who have sex with men (MSM) following an actual or potential sexual exposure to HIV. This biomedical intervention is known as nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis (NPEP). Patients receive NPEP if they meet the criteria outlined in the 2007 National Australian NPEP Guidelines. Three or two anti-HIV drugs are administered for 28-days depending on the severity of the the assessed HIV acquisition risk. In this study eviplera would constitute 3-drug NPEP. Tenofovir-emtricitabine (truvada) a component of eviplera has been used in NPEP at SVH since 2006. This is a multi site prospective open-label non-randomised trial. Participants will be MSM who present at the various recruitment sites requesting NPEP. Initially 50 eligible participants will be assigned to receive eviplera 25mg once daily taken with food for 28-days according to established Australian guidelines for the use of 3-drug NPEP. There will be 7 visits over a 12-week period. Follow-up post NPEP is for 8 weeks. If an interim analysis demonstrates acceptable safety it is proposed to seek ethics approval to increase the samples size to 100 patients to gain more accurate information on regimen completion rate and on-drug adherence. The primary study objectives are:   1. To describe the safety of 28 days of NPEP using co-formulated FTC-RPV-TDF   2. To describe the tolerability of 28 days of NPEP using FTC-RPV-TDF   3. To describe on-drug adherence and regimen completion rates of 28 days of NPEP using FTC-RPV-TDF    ,NCT01715636

HIV,Complementary & Alternative Medicine Use in HIV+ Latinos in the US-Mexico Border, The goal of The investigators community-based participatory research study is to identify the nature and extent of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among HIV-positive Latinos on the San Diego/Tijuana border. CAM use among US Latinos living with HIV is associated with delayed utilization of and poor adherence to antiretroviral therapies (ARVs) that may exacerbate health disparities in HIV care access and health outcomes. This study will lead to development of culturally-effective interventions to improve access and adherence to HIV care in Latinos who face health disparities. The investigators hypothesis is that greater use of CAM will be observed among HIV-positive Latinos who report a) crossing the U.S. border more frequently and b) having migrated to Tijuana or San Diego (e.g. from southern Mexico). The investigators also hypothesize that compared to HIV-positive Latinos who report using herbal CAM those who do not use herbal CAM are more likely to be receiving ARVs and report higher levels of adherence to ARVs; Compared to HIV-positive Latinos who do not attend religious services regularly those who attend religious services regularly are more likely to be receiving ARV; Compared to HIV- positive Latinos who report experiencing HIV related stigma those who do not report experiencing HIV-related stigma are significantly more likely to be receiving ARVs.    ,NCT01152684

HIV,Medical Marijuana Use in HIV+ Patients Prospective Cohort Study, The investigators are interested in understanding personal factors such as medical conditions and mental health as well as social and economic factors that influence marijuana (and other substance) use in HIV-positive patients. Several alternative hypotheses will be evaluated in the proposed project:   1. healthier patients may self-select marijuana use;   2. marijuana use may be associated with consequences that create barriers to seeking healthcare;   3. marijuana use may have medicinal value that reduces the need for such care.    ,NCT01536899
HIV,Medical Marijuana Use in HIV+ Patients: Probability Survey, More scientific information is needed about medical marijuana use among HIV positive patients. There is conflicting information about the use of marijuana use of medical marijuana and the associations between them and health status/health risk behaviors/health care utilization. In addition it is not clear whether patients who participate in prospective clinical studies differ from participants who do not participate; if there are differences between those two groups then this would limit generalizability of knowledge about these issues. The goal of this project is to describe the use of marijuana among HIV positive patients and its association with health status/health risk behaviors/health care utilization.    ,NCT01536912
HIV,A Prospective Observational Study to Examine the Effects of Ageing on the 'Pharmacokinetic and Clinical Observations in People Over Fifty', The purpose of this study is to identify medical conditions that may cause particular problems to individuals receiving care for HIV infection over the age of 50. In addition as the effects and potentially the side effects of HIV medication may change with age this study will also investigate the association between age and differing effects of antiretroviral therapies such as treatment outcomes side effects and the levels of drugs in blood. Results from this study may inform future HIV treatment guidelines on how we monitor individuals with HIV infection. The results may also assist in the design of future studies for the treatment of diseases associated with ageing.    ,NCT01737047
HIV,Transplantation and the Use of Raltegravir in HIV-Infected Patients, Raltegravir (RAL) is a preferred option for initial antiretroviral therapy in the most recent HIV Treatment Guidelines and is emerging as a popular choice for use in the specialized population of HIV-infected patients being considered for solid organ transplantation. Data from HIV-infected persons with normal organ function have revealed few raltegravir-associated metabolic complications compared to older antiretrovirals and in general drug-drug interactions with raltegravir are infrequent. The absence of such concerns appears to make raltegravir a potentially appealing option for antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients being considered for solid organ transplantation. At present however little is known of the safety and long term tolerability of RAL-containing regimens in persons undergoing solid organ transplantation. As more HIV-infected patients undergo organ transplantation there is a growing need for good data on such things as the effect of dialysis on RAL concentrations the potential interactions with commonly used immunosuppressive drugs and the pharmacokinetic (PK) /pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics in those with end stage organ failure as well as those with functioning grafts. The proposed study will also examine transplant function and survival in HIV-infected patients receiving RAL-containing ART and will compare it to HIV negative historic controls.    ,NCT01793467
HIV,IMPAACT P1092: Steady State PK in Malnourished HIV Infected Children, HIV-infected children from sub-Saharan Africa often present with severe malnutrition. In severe malnutrition metabolic and/or gut structural derangement may lead to inadequate antiretroviral (ARV) absorption and/or erratic drug levels. The greater surface area to weight ratio in severely malnourished children could also place them at higher risk of under dosing compared to children with mild to moderate malnutrition. However limited data are available on the pharmacokinetics of ARVs in severely malnourished children. This study will address this critical gap in knowledge by evaluating the PK of zidovudine (ZDV) lamivudine (3TC) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in severely malnourished children compared to children with normal nutrition to mild malnutrition.    ,NCT01818258

HIV,Evaluation of a Blood Test to Measure Immune Function in HIV Positive People Compared With HIV Negative People, The health of the immune system in HIV infected people is currently determined from a blood test measuring the number of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T lymphocytes. These cells play a critical role in an immune response. Studies have shown that low numbers (below the normal range) of CD4 T lymphocytes indicates a defect in the immune system. Conversely the number of CD4 T lymphocytes within the normal range generally indicates a normal immune system. When a person is infected with HIV the CD4 T lymphocytes are attacked and destroyed and the numbers decline meaning that the immune system can no longer effectively protect the body from infection or cancers. However when the HIV infected person is successfully treated with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) the CD4 T lymphocytes numbers increase and may end up in the normal range but the immune system may still not function properly as a number of these cells are incapable of functioning properly. It would be interesting to know how functional the immune system is rather than the number of cells. For this the QuantiFERONÂ® Monitor (QFM or CST007) test is an experimental diagnostic test used in this study to measure the immune function from people infected with HIV. The objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the QFM test in HIV infected people compared with uninfected people by measuring the function of the immune system. The QFM test measures interferon-gamma released in the plasma following incubation of heparinised whole blood with a combination of stimulants. As immune function is directly influenced by cells with actively replicating HIV an additional research test called the HIV Reservoir Test will be included to better understand the level of immune function in each study subject. How long will it take? One visit for about 1 hour with Dr. Gatpolintan and his Clinical Study Coordinator to answer questions then about 10 minutes for a blood draw (nine blocks from Dr. Gatpolintan' office). Study outcome measures (Correlation between QFM and CD4 counts and CD4/CD8 ratios) will be assessed including data presentation within an average period of 1 year after study subject enrollment.    ,NCT01904201
HIV,CCTG 593: Testing and Linkage to Care, This is a CCTG sponsored project to determine if those recently screened for HIV would accept assistance to be linked into appropriate health services. After receiving their HIV results high-risk individuals who test negative will have an option to be linked into a study that offers them Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and individuals who test positive will have an option to be linked into care. If they accept tested individuals will be in contact with an ALERT specialist that will help facilitate their linkage. The study's primary analysis will analyze how many HIV screened individuals accept the ALERT specialist assistance.    ,NCT01941121
HIV,Open Label Pilot Study of Darunavir Boosted by Cobicistat in Combination With Rilpivirine to Treat HIV+ NaÃ¯ve Subjects, Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend the use of triple-drug therapy (two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and either a protease inhibitor non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or an integrase inhibitor) for the treatment of antiretroviral (ARV)-naÃ¯ve patients. With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) patients with HIV are living much longer. With the increasing lifespan of persons with HIV long-term complications from therapy as well as the occurrence of co-morbidities with aging have prompted HCPs to re-think the current treatment paradigm and consider novel combinations of ARVs. All of the currently approved HIV antiretrovirals have been implicated in causing long-term toxicities; however the greatest body of evidence for long-term metabolic effects has implicated the nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI) class. By utilizing a non-NRTI treatment regimen it is hypothesized that many of these long-term metabolic effects (renal toxicity bone loss body fat changes) can be delayed or avoided altogether. The clinical data on novel combinations is currently limited but rapidly growing and has included several combinations that have utilized darunavir. This study will be the first of its kind using the unique combination of darunavir/cobicistat and rilpivirine. Currently this drug combination is not a recommended option for first time treatment of HIV    ,NCT02404233

HIV,HIV Posterior Cheek Enlargement, Altered contour of the lower face is a frequent complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV facial lipoatrophy or loss of facial fat commonly results from antiretroviral therapy. Posterior cheek enlargement leading to a bulky and widened lower facial contour can also be seen in HIV. These changes can lead to significant cosmetic disfigurement and have an enormous psychosocial impact on patients. They also make individuals vulnerable by making them recognizable as persons living with HIV. Posterior cheek enlargement has not been well characterized. Both the parotid salivary gland and the masseter muscle are located in the posterior cheek region. Although parotid gland enlargement in a common complication of HIV it is unknown whether enlargement of the masseter muscle also contributes. The investigators plan to study posterior cheek enlargement in HIV positive individuals. The investigators also plan to use botulinum toxin A as a novel treatment to improve the altered lower facial contour seen in HIV. This treatment has already demonstrated efficacy in HIV negative individuals with enlargement of the masseter muscle. Botulinum toxin has also been used safely in the salivary glands in individuals with excessive drooling resulting from neurological disease. In a trial HIV+ patient the investigators have already demonstrated the efficacy of using botulinum toxin A in the treatment of posterior cheek enlargement resulting from both parotid and masseter muscle enlargement. The investigators anticipate this study will increase our understanding of posterior cheek enlargement in HIV and lead to the development of a novel treatment for this important complication. The investigators hypothesize that posterior cheek enlargement in HIV+ patients will in some cases result from both masseter muscle hypertrophy as well as parotid gland enlargement. The investigators also hypothesize that the treatment of posterior cheek enlargement with botulinum toxin A will result in a more aesthetically appealing lower facial contour in HIV+ patients. This has already been demonstrated in a trial HIV+ patient in which there was a dramatic change in the volume of the masseter muscle and parotid gland 12 weeks after treatment with botulinum toxin A.    ,NCT01635504
HIV,PrEP in Breastfeeding Study, The purpose of this study is to quantify the magnitude and extent of infant exposure to daily emtricitabine (FTC) /tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) via maternal breastmilk when taken pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by lactating HIV-uninfected women.

HIV,Effectiveness of Opiate Replacement Therapy Administered Prior to Release From a Correctional Facility - 1, Much of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is driven by transmission from or to persons addicted to opiates. Many of these individuals pass through a correctional setting each year creating an opportunity for linkage to substance abuse treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of initiating opiate replacement therapy prior to release from incarceration on reducing HIV risk behaviors and drug relapse. In addition this study evaluated the effectiveness of short-term payment versus non-payment of community opiate replacement therapy immediately following release from incarceration.    ,NCT00142935

HIV,Rectal Microbicide Safety and Acceptability Trial of Topically Applied Tenofovir Compared With Oral Tablet, To date the majority of microbicide research has focused on the assessment of the safety and effectiveness of vaginal microbicides used for the prevention of HIV transmission via the vaginal compartment. Receptive anal intercourse (RAI) is common among men who have sex with men (MSM) and there is increasing evidence that heterosexual women in the developed and developing world also practice anal sex. It can therefore be anticipated that once vaginal microbicides are licensed they will be used in both the vaginal and rectal compartments. As a consequence there is a need to evaluate both the rectal and vaginal safety profile of candidate microbicides. Therefore the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the systemic safety of 1% vaginally formulated tenofovir gel applied rectally. In addition this study will evaluate the immunotoxicity of the gel and evaluate its acceptability; it will also use the oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (TDF) rectally-applied tenofovir geland a placebo gel to compare their systemic and compartmental pharmacokinetic (pK) profiles. This study was designed to address the following hypotheses:   -  Vaginally-formulated tenofovir 1% topical gel when applied rectally will be safe using a combination of clinical and laboratory markers including assays specifically designed to measure mucosal toxicity   -  Tenofovir will be detectable at different concentrations in the various anatomic compartments sampled for pharmacokinetics following single and 7-day topical exposures   -  Exposure to tenofovir 1% gel will demonstrate prevention of ex vivo HIV-1 challenge using in vivo drug-exposed tissue as compared to baseline tissue samples   -  Orally delivered single dose 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets will have similar safety profiles using routine blood safety indices as have been established in other trials and will show no mucosal safety concerns   -  The oral dose will have different multi-compartment concentration kinetics than the topical tenofovir and will also demonstrate preliminary (ex vivo) prevention using the explant infectivity assay   -  Vaginally formulated tenofovir 1% topical gel applied rectally will be acceptable to participants as indicated by a score in the upper one third of the 10-point Likert scale on intentionality to use in the product in the future    ,NCT00984971
HIV,S.T.A.R.S.: Sistas Talking About Real Solutions, STARS: Sistas Talking About Real Solutions is a health education intervention for African-American women ages 18-29 aimed at reducing their risk for HIV. A total of 855 subjects were recruited from three Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers. Members were randomly selected from the membership database and sent a letter via mail introducing them to the project and inviting them to participate. Letters were followed up with a phone call and potential participants were screened for eligibility. To be able to participate participants had to be African-American female between the ages of 18-29 single and have at least one act of unprotected sexual intercourse within the last 6 months. Members who were eligible and willing to participate completed a 1-hour baseline assessment survey; STD testing for Chlamydia gonorrhea trichomoniasis and HPV; a vaginal swab that was used to determine if they had unprotected sex. They were then randomized into one of two study conditions: (1) a 2-session HIV risk-reduction condition with a safer sex relapse prevention component (2) a 1-session control condition in which participants receive general women's health information and brochures. Participants received a booster session at 6 and 9 months to reinforce intervention materials. Participants completed an assessment survey and received STD testing at 6 and 12 months. The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of the HIV risk-reduction/safer sex relapse prevention condition relative to the health and nutritional control group in reducing HIV-associated sexual behaviors and incident STDs over a 12-month follow-up period is to implement.    ,NCT01028157
HIV,Raltegravir Use as Nonoccupational Postexposure Prophylaxis (NPEP) in Men Who Have Sex With Men, The use of anti-HIV drugs following a potential sexual or injecting drug use exposure to HIV in order to try and prevent an exposure from becoming an infection is common. This is called nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (NPEP). The likelihood of NPEP succeeding is related to intrinsic qualities of the drugs used which includes at which point in the life cycle of the HIV virus the drugs work how strong the drugs are against HIV and how well tolerated the drugs are i.e. what side effects they produce. Many people skip doses during their treatment or abandon their treatment because of side effects. The anti-HIV drug raltegravir works early in the life cycle of the virus i.e. before it integrates with human DNA is potent against HIV and causes few side effects. These qualities make it an obvious choice for use as a NPEP treatment. In this study 100 HIV negative men will receive raltegravir along with another HIV drug called truvada (commonly used in NPEP) for 28 days after a possible sexual exposure to HIV. They will be monitored closely for adverse events side effects and for their ability to take the medicine each day for the whole 28 days. The hypothesis in this study states that raltegravir use in NPEP will be safe well tolerated and result in a high treatment completion rate.    ,NCT01087840

HIV,Integrated Mental Health Treatment & HIV Prevention for Court-Involved Youth, Youth and young adults in the juvenile justice system have a high prevalence of concurrent psychiatric and substance use disorders and are also at high risk for HIV. However even when the disorders and risks are recognized most programs do not address all of these important problems and long-term efficacy for all outcomes simultaneously has yet to be demonstrated for these multi-problem youth. Adverse outcomes for youth include partially treated or relapsing psychiatric disorders continued substance abuse unchanged HIV risk and further legal problems. This project in collaboration with the Rhode Island Family Court with whom we have existing collaborations will address these issues by implementing an Integrated Treatment Program (ITP) that targets mental health/substance abuse disorders and HIV risk. ITP is novel by targeting multiple adolescent problems simultaneously involving parents to augment change and its delivery within the Family Court. This study will extend our previous efficacious interventions among youth with psychiatric disorders to court-involved youth. Adolescents and their parents will be enrolled from the Rhode Island Family Court Mental Health Clinic where youth aged 13-17 are referred by judges for comprehensive assessment and referral for treatment. This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy among 200 sexually active court-involved youth who need outpatient treatment of the novel integrated treatment (ITP n=100) as compared to enhanced standard care in community outpatient services (ESC n=100) over an 18-month period (6 months of ITP or ESC and 12 months of follow-up). ITP consists of three components: 1) individual cognitive behavioral therapy which includes a motivational interviewing component and is modular-based to address concurrent mental health and substance abuse issues; 2) family and parent training sessions to address parental communication and monitoring to support risk reduction among youth; 3) multifamily group workshops to address HIV risk family communication and peer resistance skills. Youth in both conditions (ITP and ESC) will receive similar case management services from the court and psychiatric medication management (if needed) from a study psychiatrist. ITP will be compared to ESC on reductions in sexual risk behavior substance use symptoms of psychiatric disorders and legal offenses.    ,NCT01421485
HIV,Four-Arm Randomized Control Trial of Brief MI Versus Couples-Based HIV/STI Prevention in South Africa, This study is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of Integrated and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for HIV Prevention in Pretoria South Africa. The RCT will evaluate the efficacy of a brief motivational interview (BMI) and a cognitive-behavioral couples' (IFCBT) intervention alone and in combination against a comparison condition to reduce new cases of HIV and sexually transmitted infections and increase condom use and decrease sexual risk behavior drug use and intimate partner violence among young female drug users in Pretoria South Africa and their primary intimate partners. In the RCT 384 couples comprised of young female drug users who do (N = 192) and do not (N = 192) trade sex and their primary intimate heterosexual partners will be randomly assigned to one-of-four conditions: (1) testing and counseling; (2) brief motivational interview (BMI); (3) cognitive-behavioral couples' intervention (IFCBT); or (4) BMI and IFCBT combined. Eligibility criteria for couples include an HIV-negative drug using female aged 18 to 40 and their primary intimate partner or spouse who is also HIV negative. Each partner of each couple will be administered assessments with a rapid test for HIV and urine tests for Chlamydia gonorrhea trichomoniasis and drug use at baseline and 3-month 6-month and 12-month follow-up.    ,NCT01554423
HIV,A Study to Compare Three Different Formulations of Tenofovir 1% Gel When Administered Rectally, This is a double-blinded randomized safety acceptability pharmacokinetic and ex vivo efficacy study of three rectally-applied tenofovir-based microbicide formulations. Approximately 18 total evaluable HIV-negative men and women (~9 per site) will be enrolled across two study sites: University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and Magee-Womens Research Institute (MWRI) at University of Pittsburgh. Each participant will experience seven rectal exposures to the rectal-specific formulation (RF) and seven rectal exposures to the reduced glycerin vaginal formulation (RGVF) of tenofovir 1% gel but only one exposure to the vaginal formulation (VF) which will be coupled with six preceding exposures to the Universal HEC Placebo Gel to balance out the VF study stage. Participant accrual will take approximately 6 months and each participant will be on study for approximately 3 months. The total duration of the study will be approximately 1 year. The primary objectives of the study are safety acceptability and pharmacokinetics specifically:   -  To evaluate the safety of each tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation when applied rectally   -  To evaluate the acceptability of each tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation when applied rectally   -  To compare systemic and compartment pharmacokinetics among the three tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulations when applied rectally Secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the mucosal immunotoxicity of each tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation when applied rectally. And the exploratory objective of the study is to assess the preliminary (ex vivo) efficacy of each tenofovir-based microbicide gel formulation using biopsy explants after each product is applied rectally.    ,NCT01575405

HIV,Couples in Context: An RCT of a Couples-based HIV Prevention Intervention, The prevalence for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa is 18% among 15-49 year old adults and 30% among female antenatal clinic attendees (UNAIDS 2007) indicating continuing need for effective HIV prevention. Further recent studies in sub-Saharan Africa found 60-94% of new HIV infections are occurring within marriage or co-habiting heterosexual partnerships (Dunkle et al. 2008). These findings signal the need for HIV prevention interventions that target couples in South Africa. This study is a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention to increase HIV testing among couples living in Vulindlela South Africa. The proposed intervention consists of six sessions (one mixed gender group one single gender group and four couples' counseling sessions). Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with 350 heterosexual couples we will test the hypothesis that compared with a one-time mixed-gender group session the proposed intervention will improve communication intimacy and trust necessary for mutual decision-making about behaviours related to sexual risk behaviour and testing for HIV. Improving couples' ability and motivation to participate in Couples HIV Testing and Counseling (CHTC) for HIV will in turn lead to reductions in sexual risk behaviour. Both of these outcomes are necessary and effective strategies to reduce the risk of HIV transmission within primary partnerships. This intervention is informed by several qualitative studies conducted in Vulindlela and Soweto South Africa via a K08 award from NIH as well as other funding sources. These preliminary studies provided insight into the challenges couples face in participating in CHCT as well as the skills they need in order to address these barriers. Our experience conducting both qualitative and quantitative studies with comparable populations (i.e. South African couples) has also informed the recruitment and retention methods in this intervention. The proposed study takes advantage of the infrastructure and collaborative relationships that the PI has developed that have enabled her to implement and conduct research within these communities. The specific aims of the project are to test the efficacy of a theory-based and culturally appropriate couples-based intervention on the following outcomes:   1. Rates of testing for HIV   2. Sexual risk behaviour for HIV (with primary and any concurrent partners). In addition we will evaluate the extent to which hypothesized mediating factors (e.g. relationship dynamics) explain the major outcomes and the extent to which the intervention affects these factors. Ultimately our goal is to facilitate the outcome that members of partnerships learn their own and their partner's HIV status. This is a crucial step for effective behavioural risk reduction yet it is a relatively uncommon occurrence for partners in Vulindlela South Africa. Specifically mutual disclosure of HIV status accomplishes two important goals. First this knowledge can facilitate risk-reduction behaviour within partnerships via effecting positive changes (e.g. condom use) in sexual behaviour with primary and any concurrent partners. Second knowledge of HIV status can increase access to treatment and care for HIV-positive individuals as well as reinforce behavioural choices (e.g. limiting concurrent partners) to stay HIV-negative. As couples are particularly vulnerable for HIV infection in this context increasing testing for HIV and reducing likelihood of behavioural transmission of HIV within partnerships would be a high-impact outcome with the potential to significantly reduce the impact of HIV in an area already severely affected by the pandemic.    ,NCT01953133

HIV,Experimental Analysis of HIV Risk Assessment Reactivity in South African Clinics, Randomized clinical trials of HIV prevention interventions typically include extensive baseline assessments of the risk behaviors that interventions target. Such pretests have the potential to direct participants' attention to the factors that put them at risk of HIV infection. Evidence from intervention study control groups the motivational enhancement and attitude change literature and our preliminary studies suggest that assessments that lead people to think about behaviors with potentially negative outcomes lead to motivation for risk behavior reduction. As a consequence HIV intervention research using baseline assessments may not accurately predict the impact of a given HIV prevention intervention outside of the research context in particular when interventions are evaluated among high-risk isolated individuals. However the actual effects as well as public-health consequences and mechanisms of HIV assessment reactivity have never been systematically tested. The proposed assessment reactivity study will be conducted in South Africa a country with high levels of HIV prevalence incidence and stigma. The Republic of South Africa's HIV/AIDS epidemic has emerged recently relative to other sub-Saharan countries and yet 21.5% of South Africans aged 15-49 -- more than 1 in 5 people -- are infected with HIV (UNAIDS 2004). Despite the common presence of HIV in South Africa it remains largely a hidden disease and HIV-related stigma interferes with peoples' ability to protect themselves through open discussion or spontaneous reflection on personal risk. Under these conditions it is reasonable to expect a sizable effect from directing people's attention to their HIV relevant behaviors an effect that could be incorrectly ascribed to brief interventions used in low-resource settings. The conditions in South Africa therefore heighten the clinical and public health significance of the assessment reactivity issue in that (a) it is vital to understand how reactivity may affect the results of behavioral intervention trials and (b) it may be possible to capitalize on assessment reactivity through brief assessment-based interventions. This study will allow us to achieve our primary aim: 1. To separate the effect of a brief HIV-risk reduction intervention from the potential effects of two types of baseline assessment commonly applied in HIV intervention research: a detailed calendar-based assessment and a general frequency assessment. The detailed calendar-based assessment will potentially lead participants to observe themselves in specific risk-behavior situations providing them with the opportunity to reassess the risk involved in those situations in light of their health goals and thus motivating them for behavior change. The general frequency assessment will merely prompt participants to estimate the overall frequency with which they engaged in several HIV-related behaviors. The effect of these assessments on participants' sexual behavior will be examined alone and in combination with the HIV-risk reduction intervention. In addition this project has two important secondary aims:   1. To generate urgently needed additional efficacy data for a promising HIV risk reduction intervention culturally tailored for use and found to be effective in South Africa   2. To determine potential HIV preventive effects of different types of HIV risk behavior assessments on risk behavior reduction in South Africa for future intervention development To achieve the above aims the investigators will:   1. Recruit 1500 patients (50% women) age 18-44 from the Spencer Rd. STD Clinic Cape Town South Africa.   2. Randomly assign participants within gender to one of 6 study arms in a modified Solomon Four-Group (SFG) design. The 2 (intervention: standard of care vs. an efficacious theory based HIV prevention intervention) x 3 (baseline face-to-face interview: none vs. basic single-item frequency questions vs. detailed partner-by-partner calendar-based interview) factorial design is depicted below:    ,NCT01580657
HIV,Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid for Protease-inhibitor Associated Insulin Resistance, Rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes are more than 2-fold greater in HIV infected people than the general population. Protease inhibitor booster antiretroviral therapy (PI-ART) which is used by ~50% of HIV infected people in the USA is an established risk factor for diabetes. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) a naturally occurring bile salt improves insulin sensitivity in HIV uninfected subjects although the mechanisms for these benefits are unclear. This study will explore the hypothesis that TUDCA will improve insulin action in people with HIV who are receiving PI-ART. Further this project will clarify the molecular mechanisms responsible for these improvements potentially benefiting society irrespective of HIV status.    ,NCT01877551
HIV,Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM) Neurocog 1&2 Study, The treatment of HIV and the tests performed for HIV care have changed over the last 20 years but improvement of management of HIV-infected subjects is still warranted. The investigators would like to collect and analyse clinical information obtained from subjects who are between 18 and 50 years of age. The investigators will look at routine clinic information such as blood pressure recent blood test results and clinical history. The investigators will then assess cognitive (brain) function by talking and/or written tests. These tests will include tests for memory depression and anxiety. All of those who are identified as having problems with their brain function in this way will be offered onward referral for further assessment as appropriate. Those taking part will be offered a follow up visit at 24-48 weeks after the first assessment to see if there are any changes. This will allow us to understand how brain problems develop get worse or get better over time. No genetic research will be done. Depression is a mental health condition that can be characterized by negative feelings a generally low mood or problems with eating and sleeping normally. Anxiety is also a mental health condition where a person can feel general anxiousness or fear of specific situations or in more serious cases can have panic attacks. Impaired brain function is a condition of the nervous system or brain where the brain does not function as well as it normally should and can include symptoms such as forgetfulness doing everyday tasks more slowly or becoming disorientated to the time of day or the place one is in. For this study the investigators will also collect data from medical records including (and if known)social and educational-related data HIV infection-related data (e.g. date of diagnosis blood test results) relevant medical history (e.g. previous psychiatric conditions) and medication used (e.g. date started the drugs used). The information the investigators will get from this study will be used to inform healthcare providers (doctor nurse health advisor psychologist) on whether it is necessary to routinely assess HIV infected patients for the presence of anxiety/depression and impaired brain function. The investigators will also get information on whether the treatments used for HIV infection make a difference to how commonly these conditions occur in patients.    ,NCT01508559
HIV,IL-23/IL-12 Imbalance and T Lymphocyte Polarization in HIV Infection, Progressive HIV or HIV infection seems to be related to a preferential loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes especially Th17+ within the mucosal intestinal lymphoid tissue and with intestinal mucosal damage and bacterial product translocation which correlates with the hyperactivation of the immune system therefore with CD4+ T cell loss and prognosis. The objectives of this project are to investigate the correlation between the IL12/IL-23 imbalance and bacterial product translocation and to study the polarization infection or depletion of intestinal Th17 ex vivo. The investigators will test the effect of neutralizing anti-IL23 antibodies directed against p40 or less classically anti- IL-23 p19.    ,NCT01942655

HIV,Reducing HIV Risk Among Pregnant Women in Drug Treatment, We propose to develop and pilot test an intervention that addresses both sex- and drug-related HIV risk behavior among pregnant women in drug treatment. In the first phase of the study we will conduct focus groups with pregnant women in drug treatment as well as a focus group with their treatment providers in order to determine key areas of emphasis for an intervention in this population. We will then develop an HIV risk behavior intervention for pregnant women in drug treatment pilot the intervention with 20 women and elicit their feedback regarding the intervention. Following refinement of the intervention we will conduct a small randomized trial (n=60) to examine the impact of the intervention compared to standard care (SC). We expect that relative to SC participants randomized to the intervention condition will have lower levels of sex- and drug-related HIV risk behavior.    ,NCT00332813
HIV,Efficacy of Drug and Risk Counseling Among Methadone Patients in Jakarta Indonesia, According to UNAIDS Indonesia is experiencing one of the most rapidly expanding HIV/AIDS epidemics in Asia. The epidemic in Indonesia has been fueled by injection drug use among heroin users and the national response includes the scale-up of methadone maintenance treatment. Drug counseling is considered to be an integral part of methadone treatment but few studies have been designed to assess its benefits and costs. In settings such as Jakarta data regarding the costs and benefits of drug counseling have critical public heath relevance. The investigators propose to conduct a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of integrated drug and HIV counseling among injecting drug users. This study will be conducted at six methadone clinics in Jakarta Indonesia where the HIV prevalence among injecting drug users ranges between 50- 86% with collaborators from the Drug Dependence Hospital in Jakarta the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University. The specific aims of this four year study are to evaluate the impact of Behavioral Drug and Risk Counseling (BDRC)?”a low intensity cognitive behavioral approach that integrates drug counseling and risk reduction intervention. Those assigned to the BDRC arm will be compared to those who receive treatment as usual which includes an initial risk reduction intervention and counseling as needed. The investigators hypothesize that the structured low intensity BDRC approach will be more cost effective and result in higher rates of retention in treatment lower rates of drug use and lower rates of HIV risk. To test these hypotheses the research team in Jakarta will recruit 300 injecting drug users as they enter treatment at the Drug Dependence Hospital and its five satellite programs. Following informed consent procedures research staff will randomize participants to either the BDRC intervention or to treatment as usual. All subjects will be fuly assessed at baseline and months 3 6 9 and 12. The proposed work will be build on collaborations that have been established with the Indonesian Investigator Adhi NurhidayatMD during his NIDA INVEST Fellowship at University of Pennsylvania when he spent time with David Metzger PhD and George Woody MD. It will also extend findings from a WHO study on substitution therapy of opiates and HIV/AIDS that was completed by Riza Sarasvita MSMHS (former NIDA Humphrey Fellow at Johns Hopkins University) and her colleagues at The Drug Dependence Hospital Jakarta Indonesia.    ,NCT01360463
HIV,Sustainable HIV Risk Reduction Strategies for CJ Systems, The purpose of the Texas Christian University (TCU) Disease Risk Reduction (DRR) Project is to develop and test an intervention designed to increase positive decision-making skills among offenders for healthy living including skills for making decisions for reducing disease risk behaviors particularly those involving HIV and Hepatitis B & C. This project focuses on the critical transition time between incarceration and return to the community.    ,NCT01900210
HIV,Violence and HIV Risk Among Women, The purpose of the study is to test the feasibility acceptability and efficacy of an adapted intervention that is theoretically and empirically guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills model (IMB) and aims at reducing sexual risk behavior among women who have experienced Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as well as such an intervention.    ,NCT01695694
HIV,Disclosure to Family, The decision to disclose one's serostatus to family members creates considerable emotional strain for people living with HIV (PLWH) regardless of gender and sexual orientation. While disclosure to family members has been linked to positive outcomes including increased social support improved health outcomes (i.e. sexual physical mental) reduced loneliness and stress and improved HIV disease management the decision not to disclose can also lead to positive outcomes. To date most research about serostatus disclosure has focused on the act of disclosing - the who what where and when of disclosing - rather than the decision process involved. The investigator's long-range goal is to further refine and evaluate an intervention designed to enhance HIV disclosure decision-making among PLWH. To reach this goal the investigators are proposing a course of study with the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Assess the effectiveness of the intervention relative to an attention-control condition on a variety of primary outcomes related to disclosure and health. Specific Aim 2: Examine the effects of the intervention over time. Specific Aim 3: Explore the potential mediating effects of disclosure decision making on the primary outcomes. Specific Aim 4: Explore potential moderating effects of participant demographics (e.g. gender age) relationship characteristics (i.e. relationship satisfaction proximity importance of disclosure) and contextual variables related to family (e.g. adaptability problem-solving) on intervention effectiveness. Specific Aim 5: Evaluate the effects of treatment engagement retention and expectations on outcomes.    ,NCT02111720
HIV,Biobehavioral Interventions for HIV-negative Stimulant Using Men Who Have Sex With Men, This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of a contingency management (CM) intervention compared to a yoked control condition for eliminating illicit stimulant use and for decreasing time to initiating post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for improving adherence to PEP and for completing PEP following a potential HIV-exposure event. Men who have sex with men who use cocaine amphetamine or methamphetamine frequently also have high risk sexual behaviors during or after their drug use. The objective of this study evaluates whether the use of CM that targets stimulant use significantly aids men who have sex with men who use stimulants and also engage in high-risk sexual transmission behaviors to be able to initiate adhere to and complete PEP thereby optimizing the utility of a biomedical HIV prevention intervention for reducing HIV incidence in this very high-risk group of MSM.    ,NCT01140880
HIV,Screening Protocol for HIV Vaccine Studies, Healthy volunteers will be screened under this protocol for possible participation in a study testing a vaccine against HIV the virus that causes AIDS. Healthy adults 18 to 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Participants must be in good general health with no history of significant medical problems or abnormal laboratory test results. Pregnant or breast-feeding women and people infected with HIV will not be enrolled. Participants enrolled in this protocol will undergo the following tests and procedures within 8 weeks before the start of the experimental vaccine study:   -  Medical history including history of sexual activity and drug use   -  Physical examination   -  Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age   -  Blood and urine tests to evaluate possible medical problems such as liver and kidney function; to evaluate immune function; and to test for HIV hepatitis and syphilis Individuals who are identified through this screening protocol as possible candidates for an HIV vaccine trial will be provided additional information about study options.    ,NCT00031304
HIV,HIV-1 Vaccine Test in Uninfected Adult Volunteers, This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and examine whether it induces an immune response to HIV. A vaccine is a substance given to try to create resistance or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic material) of four HIV proteins called 'gag' 'pol' 'Nef' and 'Env'. Injected into a human the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will see if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or any proteins made from it. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests. Women will also have a pregnancy test. Women enrolled in the study must either be infertile (e.g. due to menopause or hysterectomy) or must agree either to abstain from heterosexual sex or to practice birth control for at least 21 days before beginning the study and throughout its duration. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a placebo (a salt solution that does not contain any active substance) and will be divided into three groups based on their entry into the study. Of the first seven people enrolled (Group 1) five will receive a 2-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If the vaccine is safe at this dose then in Group 2 five people will receive a 4-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If this dose is safe then in Group 3 thirty people will receive an 8-mg dose of vaccine and six will receive placebo. All participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector 2000Â® (Registered Trademark). At the time of each injection participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after immunization. At home they will record their temperature and any symptoms they may experience including any effects at the injection site for at least 7 days or as long as the symptoms remain. If symptoms occur participants will report them immediately to the clinic staff and if necessary come to the clinic for an examination. Participants will have about 10 clinic visits during the study. Most visits will last about 2 hours; those on vaccination days will last about 4 hours. ...    ,NCT00047931

HIV,Effects of Potent Antiretroviral Therapy on Kaposi s Sarcoma, Background: Kaposi s sarcoma (KS) is caused by a gammaherpesvirus called Kaposi s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). However infection with KSHV is not sufficient to cause KS and HIV infection is an important cofactor. Treatment of HIV with potent antiretroviral therapy can reduce the risk of KS and can also induce regression in patients with established HIV-KS. One mechanism by which HIV is believed to contribute to KS is through HIV-induced immunodeficiency which leads to a loss of immunologic control of KSHV and/or KS itself. However other mechanisms may also contribute. Objectives: One primary objective is to assess the effects of the initiation of potent anti-HIV therapy on specific factors possibly linked to the control or pathogenesis of KS namely serum viral IL-6 and plasma VEGF levels in patients with KS or at risk for KS by virtue of being infected with KSHV/HHV-8. Another is to assess the effects of anti-HIV therapy on KSHV infection. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of potent antiretroviral therapy on established KS and other factors related to KS or KSHV infection. Eligibility: The principal eligibility factors are age 13 or above HIV infection and either KS or infection with KSHV. Exclusion factors include KS that requires specific therapy recent corticosteroid therapy recent cytokine therapy or opportunistic infections requiring therapy. Design: Patients will be treated with potent antiretroviral therapy. For patients with established KS the effects of the therapy on the KS will be monitored. In addition a variety of factors related to KS HIV infection therapy or KSHV infection will be monitored. These include the HIV viral load KSHV secretion in saliva the CD4 count serum VEGF levels and serum IL-6 levels.    ,NCT00006171

HIV,Effectiveness Study Low-Dose Naltrexone Versus ARV's for HIV+, In the vast majority of those infected with HIV virus who are untreated there is deterioration in immune health over a period of months or years inevitably leading to full-blown AIDS and demise. Treatment with ARV's stop or slow down this deterioration if started before a certain degree of progression occurs and has saved millions of lives. The investigators' study hypothesis is that effectiveness of a very low dose of an FDA-approved medication naltrexone hydrochloride (Low-Dose Naltrexone or LDN) will compare favorably to ARV's to prevent progression of HIV+ toward immune deterioration and full-blown AIDS.    ,NCT01174914

HIV,Fluoride Metabolism Bone Remodelling and Mineral Density in HIV Patients Treated With Tenofovir +/- Emtricitabine, HIV+ patients are considered at risk for excessive bone fragility. Several factors could contribute: age male sex low body mass index (BMI) HIV infection per se vitamin D deficiency using tenofovir/a protease inhibitor (time on and/or current use). Tenofovir is used in a backbone of nucleosides/nucleotides analogues with emtricitabine (FTC) licensed as TRUVADAÂ® or without this analogue licensed as VIREADÂ®. FTC closely resembles lamivudine (3TC) but is 5-fluorinated the daily intake of fluoride is ~15 mg. Fluoride induces bone formation by stimulating osteoblasts of often impaired bone quality. The aim of the study is to compare in a cross-sectional design fluoride levels bone renewal bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV+ male patients treated by TRUVADAÂ® or VIREADÂ® for more than 60 months. The patients will be randomly selected then matched according to age ethnic origin BMI.    ,NCT01813292

HIV,Revealing Increased Axonal Loss in Treated HIV Patients, HIV patients may suffer sooner from aging than average population including brain aging. Our hypothesis is that if brain dysfunctions are explained by a quicker loss of neurons in HIV patients this loss could be detected earlier by a thinning down of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) compared to non HIV patients of the same age.    ,NCT02003989
HIV,Prevalence of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease in HIV Infected Patients, Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a major cause of cognitive impairment and disability in the general population secondary to the accumulation of asymptomatic elementary lesions. CSVD is directly correlated with age and cardiovascular risk factors and therefore would be challenging in term of public health care in the future. While HIV patients share the same cardiovascular risk factors and they are often diagnosed with cognitive impairment and frailty CSVD has not been yet described in this population. The global aim is to compare the prevalence of CSVD in a well controlled HIV+ population compared to HIV- controls matched with age and sex. 500 HIV+ patients and 250 age- and sex- matched controls will undergo a screening of the CSVD with a 10 minutes MRI (FLAIR and T2*). Prevalence of the CSVD will be compared between HIV+ patients and controls. General and HIV-specific parameters from their electronic medical records will be compared between HIV+/CSVD+ and HIV+/CSVD- patients. We are expecting to prove that CSVD is more frequent in HIV+ population.    ,NCT02082574
HIV,Assessment of Age-related Hearing Loss in HIV-1 Patients, The ageing process is known to be accelerated in HIV-infected patients compared to the general population. Normal age-related hearing loss (presbyacusia) is a frequent phenomenon affecting more than 70% of people above 65 years. It is believed to be mostly the consequence of a mitochondrial damage caused by oxidative stress. Risk factors for accelerated age-related hearing loss are present in many HIV-infected patients : chronic inflammation smoking diabetes etc. The global aim is to measure the prevalence of presbyacusia in a well controlled HIV positive population in France and to compare it to HIV negative controls matched for age and sex. 90 HIV positive patients and 90 age- and sex- matched HIV negative controls will undergo a screening for presbyacusia (pure-tone speech and evoked-response audiometry). We expect to find an increased prevalence of presbyacusia in HIV-infected patients as compared to controls matched for age and sex.    ,NCT02154971

HIV,Community-based Distribution of Oral HIV Self-testing Kits, This cluster randomised trial aims to evaluate the impact of a pilot HIVST intervention of oral HIV self-testing (HIVST) as an option for HIV testing in addition to the offer of home-based rapid HIV testing through community health workers (CHW) on knowledge of HIV status among the general adult and adolescent population. The primary outcome of the trial is the proportion of individuals who know their HIV status defined as a self-report of being HIV positive or accepting testing (standard or self testing) from the CHW. Embedded within the impact evaluation is a process evaluation that will explore the fidelity of the implementation of the intervention and outputs of the intervention.

HIV,Safer Conception Intervention for HIV-1 Serodiscordant Couples, The greatest burden of the HIV-1 epidemic lies in sub-Saharan Africa where a substantial proportion of infections occur in long-term heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant partnerships. Such couples face a difficult dilemma when considering their desire to have children: forego condom use attempt to conceive and risk HIV-1 transmission or continue condom use and relinquish their childbearing desires. Based on evidence from rigorous clinical trials demonstrating the strong efficacy of individual interventions for HIV-1 prevention and formative work with HIV-1 serodiscordant couples and clinicians with expertise in HIV-1 prevention and reproductive health in the Kenyan context this study pilots a safer conception intervention that focuses on antiretrovirals (as antiretroviral therapy [ART] taken by the HIV-1 infected partner and pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] taken by the HIV-1 uninfected partner) and timed condomless sex. Additional strategies for couples include diagnosis and treatment of STIs and male circumcision. mHealth tools including SMS and mobile applications are novel and very popular among Kenyans to ease the burden of addressing health problems. This safer conception intervention incorporates mHealth tools to improve couples' experiences tracking fertility indicators and communicating with providers about their readiness to practice safer conception. SMS surveys to collect daily information from women about their fertility signs and SMS messages are used to reinforce HIV-1 prevention including condom use for couples during periods that do not have a high likelihood of fertility. An in-clinic mobile application is used to improve clinician-patient counseling and assessments of couple readiness to practice safer conception. To inform future engagement of mHealth tools the investigators will prospectively evaluate clinician and patient experiences using SMS surveys and the tablet application. Couples with immediate fertility intentions will be followed longitudinally allowing careful tracking of pregnancy and HIV-1 incidence. The study takes place in Thika Kenya.    ,NCT03030768

HIV,Evaluating the Effect of a Novel Web-based Intervention to Increase HIV Testing in Men Who Have Sex With Men, The proposed study is designed to develop and test the effectiveness of a novel web-based HIV intervention to motivate HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). The intervention arm includes the delivery of videos tailored to the reasons MSM have for not getting tested for HIV as well as HIV testing motivational messages sent via mobile-phone text messaging e-mail or instant messaging. The intervention and assessments will be guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills model the Health Belief Model and the Stages of Change theory. The control intervention will be a health promotion message (similar in content to other Peruvian websites) with an invitation for free HIV testing. Testing will be offered at the Via Libre and Epicentro clinic and at a mobile unit whose location will be determined based on participants' demand. The outcomes evaluated will be intention to get tested and actual HIV testing among MSM of each of the trial arms.    ,NCT01760057
HIV,Increasing HIV Testing in Urban Emergency Departments Via Mobile Technology, Because people with undiagnosed HIV will not receive treatment and may unknowingly infect others the investigators propose a mobile computer-based video intervention to increase HIV test rates in high volume urban hospital emergency departments (EDs). EDs offer important points of contact for many of those at greatest risk for HIV. Unfortunately when ED patients are offered routine HIV testing most decline. Our proposed intervention builds upon initial findings from a trial our research team conducted with patients who declined HIV testing. The intervention grounded in the Information-Motivation and Behavioral Skills model (IMB) showed an onscreen physician explaining the importance of HIV testing (to build knowledge and motivation) and modeling a rapid HIV test (to increase motivation and behavioral skill). This brief intervention had a potent effect: a third accepted HIV testing post-intervention. While this preliminary study is highly encouraging it revealed a number of other critical research questions. First it remains unclear what intervention component most strongly contributed to patients' decisions to test: the video content or the offer of an HIV test by a computer rather than a person. Second consistent with the literature participants indicated a community member disclosing positive HIV status onscreen would increase the proportion of patients who test. Third results suggest there is individual variation in the extent to which behavior is more strongly influenced by onscreen community members or experts (e.g. physicians). Therefore the goal of the present study guided by the IMB model is to determine how the investigators can refine mobile computer-based interventions to maximize HIV testing rates among patients who initially decline to test in the ED. At the end of the computerized intervention onscreen text will ask patients if they would agree to an HIV test. Those who agree will be tested by ED staff. The study's endpoint will be post-intervention HIV test rates. The investigators' study will inform scalable interventions for underserved populations nationwide.    ,NCT02154802
HIV,Does Preference-based HIV Testing Increase Uptake in High Risk Populations?, Despite worldwide efforts to promote HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT) rates of testing remain low. Understanding how high risk groups decide to test and adapting available testing options to their preferences has the potential to broadly improve HCT uptake and cost-effectiveness. This study proposes to use a Discrete Choice Experiment a survey method increasingly used by health economists for the design of patient-centered health care options to rigorously quantify HIV testing preferences among two high-risk populations identify their preferred testing options and evaluate in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) the effect of a preference-based HIV counseling and testing (PB-HCT) intervention on testing uptake. At a time of heightened focus on health preferences research and patient-centered care this study evaluates the critical link between preference-based intervention design and efficacy. If the RCT indicates that PB-HCT increases testing rates the testing options evaluated in this R01 can be offered to high-risk populations in the study area and the preference elicitation method and tools can be used to inform the design of testing options that better match the preferences of other high-risk populations and in other settings.    ,NCT02714140
HIV,Using Technology to Match Young Black Men and Transwomen Who Have Sex With Men or Transwomen to HIV Testing Options, Young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) and transwomen in the US are affected by HIV at severely disproportionate rates. A key component of HIV prevention for communities at risk is diagnosing HIV infections through regular HIV testing. A significant proportion of young Black MSM and transwomen have not tested in the prior year. This research study seeks to address low HIV testing rates among young Black MSM and transwomen by testing a brief Internet-based HIV testing intervention optimized for mobile devices. The intervention takes advantage of the variety of HIV testing options now available including the HIV self testing couples-based HIV counseling and testing and traditional clinic-based testing and will provide men and transwomen with a tailored recommendation of their optimal HIV testing approach. The investigators are conducting a pilot randomized study among young Black MSM and transwomen followed for 6 months to estimate the intervention's potential efficacy in increasing HIV testing.    ,NCT02834572

HIV,Nutrition Intervention in AIDS Wasting, There are no guidelines for appropriate nutritional management of weight loss or wasting in HIV infection. Some treatments may increase weight but without improving muscle mass or quality of life. In this clinical trial AIDS patients with wasting are randomized to one of three nutritional strategies and studied over a 12-week period: 1) optimal oral nutrition with counseling and protein and calorie supplementation and a placebo pill; 2) optimal oral nutrition with the oral androgen oxandrolone at 20 mg daily; and 3) optimal oral nutrition with progressive resistance training (PRT). In all participants dietary intervention is maximized by weekly personalized counseling to address individual issues and concerns. Two primary outcomes are assessed: thigh muscle mass and quality of life. Our findings can be used to develop guidelines for standards of nutritional care among AIDS patient with the wasting syndrome.    ,NCT00006167

HIV,Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management for HIV+ Drug Abusers," The primary purpose of this 5-year study is to determine whether a Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) intervention demonstrated to be effective in reducing distress enhancing coping and maintaining health among HIV+ non-drug abusers (see Schneiderman and Antoni 2000) can be effectively adapted for our target population of culturally diverse HIV+ low-income ""Recovering Drug Abusers"" (RDAs). Since the late 1980s members of our research team (i.e. Schneiderman Antoni Klimas Fletcher) have been developing refining and evaluating the effects of CBSM among HIV+ Men who have Sex with Men (MSM). In the early/mid 90s we began to adapt and evaluate the effects of CBSM in other non-drug abusing subgroups that were emerging with increasing levels of HIV seroprevalence (e.g. pregnant women African American and Hispanic men and women). After accumulating considerable support for the effectiveness of CBSM in these subgroups in the late 90s our research team (i.e. Malow Schneiderman Antoni Klimas Page) turned its attention to developing the CBSM for one of the most neglected and understudied populations affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in this country: ""inner city"" minority drug abusers. With supplemental funding on two NIH grants to conduct formative stage1 pilot research our project team has been able to develop and document the feasibility and potential promise of the CBSM approach adapted/translated for RDAs (CBSM-RDA). This application proposes to take the next logical step in continuing this work: conducting a 3 6 8 10 and 12 month follow-up outcome study comparing CBSM-RDA with a matched attention time and interest value Health Promotion Comparison (HPC) condition in 225 male and 225 female HIV+ RDAs with respect to key biopsychosocial health endpoints: distress (i.e. depressive symptoms and mood state) quality of life drug abuse relapse unsafe sex Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (CART) medication adherence and health status indicators (e.g. Viral Load CD4 count physical symptoms).

HIV,Directly Observed Therapy for Community-Released HIV+ Prisoners, The aim of this study is to develop effective interventions for HIV-infected prisoners who are released to the community. The intervention that we will study will be directly observed therapy (DAART/DOT) and we will compare this to the current standard of care that involves self-administered therapy (SAT). All subjects will get transitional case management and all subjects with a prior history of opiate dependence will be offered opiate substitution therapy (buprenorphine or methadone). Hypotheses:   -  At the end of six months those receiving DAART will have a higher level of adherence to HAART as compared to the SAT group.   -  The DAART Intervention will result in subjects having lower viral loads and higher CD4 counts as compared to the SAT group.   -  At the end of six months the DAART group will have a lower rate of recidivism to jail/prison as compared to the SAT group.   -  Over the year the DAART group will be more likely to make repeated primary HIV care visits than the SAT group.    ,NCT00786396
HIV,Effective Aids Treatment and Support in the Free State (FEATS), The aim of this study is to investigate the benefits of ARV treatment to patients to the family members of patients on ARV treatment and to communities at large. The study also aims to investigate the impact of a peer adherence support and a nutritional intervention on measures of treatment success. To this end 648 patients who had commenced ARV treatment in the past month at twelve selected health care facilities will be recruited into the study. In addition 204 randomly sampled households from the communities served by the twelve selected clinics will be recruited into the study. Trained enumerators will at baseline conduct semi-structured interviews with patients and households. Following the baseline survey patients recruited into the study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:   -  Patients receiving ARV treatment and the associated support currently provided in the public sector ARV treatment programme.   -  Patients receiving (a) plus bi-weekly visits by an experienced ARV patient who has been trained as a peer adherence supporter   -  Patients receiving (a) and (b) plus a weekly nutritional supplement in the form of two 400g cans of meatballs and spaghetti in tomato sauce The group of 'comparison' households comprises the fourth group. Trained enumerators will conduct follow-up interviews with all patients and households at approximately six- and at twelve-months respectively. In addition the ARV coordinator and other providers working in the ARV treatment programme at each of the twelve selected health care facilities will be interviewed by trained enumerators at baseline and again at six- and at twelve-months. Clinical data will be obtained from patient files at baseline and at completion of the study. Using these data various outcomes of importance to the study will be compared between the four study groups using experimental and non-experimental methods.    ,NCT00821366

HIV,Treatment Options for Protease Inhibitor-exposed Children, The investigators hypothesize that switching to a regimen based on efavirenz will be as effective and safe as remaining on a regimen based on Lopinavir/ritonavir for HIV-infected children. The investigators propose an unblinded randomized clinical trial to evaluate a simplification protease-inhibitor (PI)-sparing treatment strategy among nevirapine (NVP)-exposed HIV-infected children treated initially with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). HIV-infected children aged 3-5 years who have a history of exposure to NVP as part of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) initiated LPV/r-based therapy in the first 36 months of life or who were enrolled on the control arm of Neverest 2 and who are virally suppressed with a viral load < 50 copies/ml will be included. These children will be randomized to either substitute efavirenz (EFV) for LPV/r or to continue on their LPV/r-based regimen. Eight weeks prior to the primary randomization eligible children will also be randomized to either remain on stavudine (D4T) or switch to abacavir (ABC). Children will be followed with regular viral load and other clinical tests for 48 weeks after the primary randomization. Children in the experimental arm who have breakthrough viremia (-defined as two subsequent viral loads > 1000 copies/ml) on the EFV-based regimen will reinitiate the LPV/r regimen. The primary objective is to test whether the durability of viral suppression is equivalent when children are switched to EFV-based therapy. The primary study endpoint is failure to have HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml and/or confirmed viremia >1000 copies/ml. Secondary aims include comparison of immune preservation toxicities selection of resistance mutations and adherence across the two arms. Antiretroviral drug concentrations and adherence will be investigated as possible explanations for the success and/or failure of this simplification regimen. The overall goal of the study is to contribute to the evidence base to allow expansion of treatment options for HIV-infected children in low resource settings.    ,NCT01146873
HIV,HIV Rapid Testing & Counseling in Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Clinics in the U.S., Project Aware is a randomized controlled clinical trial in which individuals seeking medical or health services at sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics are recruited to participate in a multi-center HIV testing and counseling study. The investigators will assess the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of (1) on-site HIV rapid testing with brief participant-tailored prevention counseling vs. (2) on-site HIV rapid testing with information only. The investigators will evaluate the effect of counseling on one primary outcome: STI incidence. Secondary outcomes will be reduction of sexual risk behaviors substance use during sex (i.e. being under the influence during sex) and cost and cost effectiveness of counseling and testing. Participants will be assessed for sexually transmitted infections HIV testing history and sexual and drug use risk behaviors at baseline and at 6-months follow-up. Approximately 5000 individuals seeking medical or health services from approximately 9 STD clinics throughout the United States will be randomized. These individuals will be 18 years of age or older and efforts will be made to recruit a sample of study participants that reflects the proportion of minorities and gender in the STD clinic performance sites from which the investigators are recruiting.    ,NCT01154296

HIV,Adolescent Master Protocol, The advances in treatment to prevent maternal HIV transmission to neonates have been groundbreaking. As a result the number of new perinatally-infected children in the U.S. is now small. Subsequent improvements in the treatment of HIV-infected infants and children have been equally remarkable ensuring that most previously infected American children have survived and are approaching adolescence. In addition the number of HIV-infected adolescents worldwide is growing substantially in both resource-poor countries and in countries with increasing levels of health care. Therefore there is a global cohort of children who have been living with HIV infection since birth who are aging into adolescence. Little is definitively known about the impact of HIV infection and its treatment on the maturation process in these children. AMP is a prospective cohort study designed to define the impact of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy on pre-adolescents and adolescents with perinatal HIV infection. Domains to be investigated include growth and sexual maturation metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease cardiac function bone health neurologic neurodevelopment language hearing and behavioral function and sexually transmitted infections (STI).    ,NCT01418014

HIV,Peer-driven Intervention to Seek Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV," Approximately 21% of HIV infections in the U.S. are undiagnosed but only about 40% of all adults have been tested. Thus late diagnosis of HIV is common and furthermore treatment delays and disruptions are widespread. Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to test for HIV are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late and experience serious barriers to entering care compared to other groups. The investigators research team has studied HHR in New York City (NYC) as part of the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) studies. The investigators found an HIV prevalence rate of 7.4% among HHR in NYC and only 6% of these infections had been previously diagnosed. Further in central Brooklyn 10% were newly diagnosed with HIV. The proposed study will use NHBS methodology to target HHR in central Brooklyn. The primary goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a peer-driven intervention (PDI) to seek test treat and retain HHR. The investigators will also compare the effectiveness of two sampling methods to reach HHR: Respondent-driven sampling (a peer-based approach) versus venue-based sampling (a location-based approach). The two main study hypotheses are: (H1): Participants recruited by respondent-driven sampling (RDS) will be more likely to test positive for HIV compared to those recruited via venue-based sampling (VBS). H2): Participants in the ""Test and Treat: phase of the peer-driven intervention (all of whom will be HIV-infected) will show a shorter time to an HIV clinical appointment a shorter time to starting HIV medication (when medically indicated) higher rates of viral load suppression and higher rates of retention in care compared to those in the control arm.

HIV,Swaziland Safe Generations, The purpose of this study is to understand how best to provide care and treatment services to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive pregnant women and their babies in Swaziland. The study is designed to evaluate a new approach for Preventing Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT)where all HIV positive pregnant women initiate lifelong triple antiretroviral (ARV) therapy regardless of their disease stage. The goal is to prevent delays in women accessing treatment for their own health and ensure that women and their children remain in care. This study will compare this new approach to PMTCT known as Option B+ to Option A which is the current standard of care for PMTCT in Swaziland. The study will be conducted at 10 health facilities in the Manzini and Lubombo regions in Swaziland. The study has three components: the main component is a PMTCT Options Evaluation where data from medical records will be abstracted on all HIV positive pregnant women attending antenatal services at the 10 selected study facilities; data will be abstracted on their HIV exposed infants as well. Other components of the study include a PMTCT Options Acceptability Evaluation using semi-structured questionnaires with PMTCT clients and health care workers (HCWs) as well as a cost effectiveness evaluation comparing costs under conditions of Option A and Option B+.    ,NCT01891799

HIV,RCT of an Integrative Intervention for Non-Treatment-Seeking Meth Users, In the era of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) efforts are needed to identify evidence-based combination prevention approaches that achieve greater decreases HIV viral load among populations that are more likely to engage in HIV transmission risk behavior. Because methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) are at greater risk for acquiring and transmitting medication-resistant strains of HIV interventions targeting stimulant use in this population of high-risk men could boost the effectiveness of TasP. At present only conditional cash transfer approaches such as contingency management (CM) have demonstrated short- term efficacy in reducing stimulant use among substance-using MSM who are not actively seeking formal treatment. The proposed RCT will examine the efficacy of a positive affect intervention that is designed to optimize the effectiveness of CM to achieve long-term reductions in stimulant use and HIV viral load in this population. the investigators' team will examine the efficacy of this integrative intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 230 HIV-positive methamphetamine-using MSM. After enrolling in CM participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) the positive affect intervention; or 2) a attention-matched control condition. Follow-up data will be collected at 3 6 and 12 months post-randomization. This RCT will provide an opportunity to examine the efficacy of an integrative intervention designed to promote long-term reductions in HIV viral load as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes that will be examined include: increases positive affect reductions in stimulant use improvements in T-helper (CD4+) count and decreases HIV transmission risk behavior. Identifying an efficacious intervention approach to decrease HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM would substantially support the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy to reduce HIV incidence and mitigate HIV-related health disparities.    ,NCT01926184

The investigators hypothesize that TFV-DP levels will be lowest in individuals with a detectable viral load and highest in those with viral suppression.    ,NCT02012621
HIV,Effect of Omega 3 Fatty Acids on Oxidative Stress in HIV Seropositive Patients, Introduction: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has showed its effectiveness in the prevention of complications in seropositive for HIV patients. However they develop some manifestations such as lipodystrophy dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance increasing cardiovascular risk. Clinical trials in general population and in patients on hemodialysis have demonstrated a significant reduction in cardiovascular events using fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids are believed to be beneficial in prevention of atherosclerosis reducing lipids levels specially triglycerides. Also in general populations it has been described a benefit effect of omega 3 acids on oxidative stress. Objective: to know the effect of omega 3 acids on different markers of oxidative stress in seropositive HIV patients. Methods: We will perform a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial in seropositive HIV patients from 20 to 55 years old on clinical score A1 A2 B1 or B2 who received HAART. They will be randomly assigned to receive omega 3 fatty acids 2.4 g (Zonelabs Marblehead MA) or placebo for 6 months. At baseline anthropometric measurements lipid profile glucose and stress oxidative levels (nitric oxide malondialdehyde total glutathion and lipid peroxidation products) will be evaluated. Sample size was calculated according to different variables. We selected the biggest one calculated for a difference in nitric oxide of 25% after treatment between groups and a standard deviation (SD) value of 10Âµmol/L. Whit this information we obtained a sample size of 31 patients per group for an 80% statistical power with Î±= 0.05. Assuming a 15% patient lost a sample size of 35 per group was considered.    ,NCT02041520

It is hypothesized that training outpatient HIV staff in palliative competencies will improve care provided that might in turn improve clinical outcomes for one group of HIV patients receiving care from the clinic. Quantitative data will be augmented by qualitative interviews of selected staff and patients in the final year of the study to appreciate response to the intervention.    ,NCT02136680

HIV,Efficacy and Safety Study of Darunavir for the Treatment of HIV/AIDS," The aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility efficacy and safety of Darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (DRV/r) monotherapy as a switch-maintenance strategy for patients receiving second-line ART at YaoundÃ© Central Hospital in Cameroon. HIV-infected adults receiving second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for ?? months with 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) will undergo plasma HIV-1 RNA (""viral"") load testing. Those with a viral load below 50 copies/ml (<50 cps/ml) will undergo a repeat test ideally 4-6 weeks later (allowed up to 12 weeks); if the viral load is confirmed as <50 cps/ml the patient will be invited to join the randomised phase of the study. Patients (n=150) will be randomised 1:2 to either continue the current triple ART regimen (n=50) or switch to DRV/r monotherapy (n=100). The primary end-point will be viral load suppression <400 cps/ml at week 24; secondary end-points will be viral load suppression <50 cps/ml at week 12 and week 24 safety tolerability and emergence of protease inhibitor (PI) drug-resistance. Patients will continue observational follow-up depending on the treatment arm they are randomized to. After week 48 patients will return to local standard of care. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenomics sub-study to correlate plasma concentrations of DRV to outcomes HIV-1 drug resistance testing sub study to detect mutants archived at the time of first-line ART failure and measuring HIV DNA load will be performed as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis will test the hypothesis that savings can be achieved by switching to DRV/r monotherapy without affecting quality of care. The primary virological objective is to evaluate efficacy in terms of the percentage of subjects who have plasma HIV-1 RNA levels <400 cps/ml after 24 weeks of follow-up following a switch to DRV/r monotherapy versus continuing triple therapy containing 2 NRTIs + LPV/r (or ATV/r) (FDA Snapshot method). Study hypothesis: we propose that maintenance therapy with DRV/r monotherapy is a feasible effective and safe treatment option for patients receiving second-line ART in YaoundÃ©.    ",NCT02155101

HIV,PrEPared and Strong: Clinic-Based PrEP for Black MSM," Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have among the highest rates of new HIV infections of any group in the United States. Developing effective HIV prevention interventions that work with this group is a critical element of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. In the first phase of our study (""the ethnographic phase"") the investigators will carry out community-based research that will explore structural social and cultural factors relevant to how Black MSM might engage with Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). This phase of community-based research will inform the design of an enhanced PrEP adherence intervention which will be subsequently tested at a community-based health clinic in Harlem in the second phase of the project.

HIV,Effectiveness of Peer Navigation and Contingency Management on Retention in HIV Care, Consistent treatment with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral load (VL) prolonging life and improving quality of life for HIV+ persons. Suppressing VL benefits communities by reducing transmission to others. Mere availability of ART and care however is insufficient; the benefits of ART depend upon HIV+ persons' continuous visits to the health care provider regular monitoring and regular delivery of medications - known as retention in HIV care. In spite of national efforts up to a quarter of HIV+ persons especially low-income minorities are out of care. Innovative interventions are therefore urgently needed to maximize engagement and retention in HIV care self-reported adherence as well as HIV-1 RNA viral load suppression. In pursuit of these aims the proposed study will assess outcomes of the following interventions in comparison to usual care: 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA) which the investigators hypothesize to be most effective in improving HIV clinical outcomes.    ,NCT02310893

HIV,Safety and Immunogenicity Study of a DNA Vaccine Combined With Protein Vaccine Against HIV/AIDS, The primary objective of the proposed phase I trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAXÂ®B/E combination regimen. Though both DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAXÂ®B/E and the combination of the two vaccines have been evaluated in humans and have shown to be safe and well tolerated this is the first time the combination regimen is being evaluated in HIV-1 uninfected African populations with and without S. mansoni. The secondary objective of the trial is to evaluate the effect of S. mansoni infection on the immunogenicity of the combination of DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAXÂ® B/E vaccine regimen. Successful vaccination against most viruses requires efficient Th1 response. There is evidence that helminth infections skew the host immune system of human and animals to T-helper type 2 (Th2) and induce immunosuppression. Therefore there is a potential that helminth infected populations may not generate the desired immune responses to vaccines designed to drive Th1-type and cytotoxic T-cell responses. Furthermore the influence of helminth infections on the development of protective antibody responses remains unclear. Limited data in animal models suggests that worm infections reduced efficacy of vaccines. The proposed vaccine trial will generate safety tolerability and immunogenicity data of a vaccination regimen with simultaneous administration of a candidate HIV DNA vaccine (DNA-HIV-PT123) and a gp120 protein vaccine (AIDSVAXÂ®B/E). This will be the first HIV vaccine trial to prospectively evaluate the impact of the S. mansoni infection on safety and immune responses to HIV vaccines.    ,NCT02376582
HIV,Collaborative Care for the Detection and Management of Depression Among Adults Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy in South Africa, With increasing access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa HIV has transitioned from a terminal illness to a long-term condition. It is likely to be accompanied by higher levels of disability and other chronic non-communicable diseases resulting from the HIV itself as well as adverse effects of medication. This requires an expansion of the purview of HIV care beyond direct HIV clinical care to also include a more comprehensive and integrated package of treatment and care for physical and mental conditions and their consequences. COBALT is a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) in public sector primary care clinics in the North West Province of SA. It will assess mental health and HIV outcomes for depressed adults receiving ART by measuring the real-world effectiveness of a facility-based stepped care intervention combining depression case detection by non-physician clinicians with group counselling intervention delivered by lay-health workers.    ,NCT02407691
HIV,Hybrid STTR Intervention for Heterosexuals: Anonymous Testing and Confidential Care Linkage," The Brooklyn Community United (BCU) study is a supplement to the main research study titled ""Peer Driven Intervention to Seek Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV."" The main study's field name is Brooklyn Community Action Project (BCAP) (R01DA032083 R#: 11-01257). The main study is testing two approaches to seeking out undiagnosed HIV infection (Venue-based Sampling (VBS) and Confidential Two-Session Testing with Navigation (CTTN-RDS)). HIV prevalence rates in two previous heterosexual cycles of NHBS in the local area are: 7% in HET1 and 12.3% in HET2. The main study BCAP found lower prevalence rates of 3.45% 35.14% of which were newly diagnosed in the RDS-CTTN sample and 1.89% newly diagnosed with HIV in the VBS sample. The primary aim of the Brooklyn Community United (BCU) study is to seek out individuals with undiagnosed HIV using a streamlined RDS-CTTN approach and anonymous HIV Testing in Central Brooklyn. The supplement study hypotheses are: (H1): Compared with VBS and RDS-CTTN and controlling for potential differences on key socio-demographic characteristics across the samples RDS-ASTN participants will have less HIV testing experience. (H2) Controlling for potential differences on key socio-demographic characteristics across the samples RDS-ASTN will yield higher rates previously undiagnosed HIV compared with VBS and RDS-CTTN. (H3): Most participants (> 70%) found to be HIV-infected in the RDS-ASTN intervention will engage in the Treat and Retain intervention phase. (H4): Most participants in the Treat and Retain phase of the RDS-ASTN intervention (> 70%) all of whom will be HIV infected will be linked to care within 3 months.    ",NCT02421159

HIV,Demonstration Project of PrEP Among Female Sex Workers in Dakar Senegal," Recent breakthroughs in antiretroviral (ARV)-based prevention provide new opportunities to rethink HIV prevention and treatment strategies especially for key populations such as Female Sex Workers (FSWs). Antiretroviral (ARV)-based prevention of HIV transmission has the potential to have a profound population-level impact on the course of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Several recently completed randomized controlled trials of HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) have shown efficacy at reducing HIV acquisition in high-risk populations. How to translate these trial results into population-level effects is the next critical step. PrEP ""demonstration"" projects in collaboration with local stakeholders and at sites of routine care for high-risk populations provide an opportunity to move promising research results into actual public health benefits. With these key features in mind the investigators propose a HIV PrEP demonstration project in FSW in Dakar Senegal West Africa. The objective of the proposed demonstration project with Tenofovir DF/Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) among Female Sex Workers (FSW) in Dakar Senegal is to build a sustainable HIV PrEP program for FSW in Dakar Senegal while demonstrating the feasibility of providing daily oral PrEP with Truvada (TDF/FTC) for 12 months to the enrolled FSW at Ministry of Heath run clinics (IHS and Pikine Mbao Rufisque and Diamniadio Health Centers). Critical milestones for this demonstration project with be feasibility uptake acceptability use of TDF/FTC PrEP and programmatic retention of FSWs in Dakar MoH clinics. The investigators have assembled an expert team from RARSThe University of Washington and Westat that have had greater than 2 decades of collaboration on HIV related projects in FSWs in Senegal. The investigators expect the results of this project will show that Senegal provides a unique opportunity to assess acceptability feasibility uptake and effectiveness of oral HIV PrEP at reducing HIV transmission in a high-risk FSW population.

The purpose of this assessment is to estimate the effect of maraviroc on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMS-626529 when coadministered in healthy subjects.   -  For the effect of BMS-663068 on the PK of maraviroc the hypothesis to be statistically tested is that BMS-663068 will not have a clinically significant effect on the PK of maraviroc when coadministered in healthy subjects.    ,NCT02480894
HIV,Demand Creation for Couples' HIV Counseling and Testing, This study aims at assessing the effect of a demand-creation intervention on couples' HIV counseling and testing (couples' HCT) uptake among married couples who have never tested together as a couple. The study is being implemented in 12 clusters; six intervention and six comparison clusters. A total of 1538 couples will be enrolled into the study; 769 couples per arm. Couples in the intervention communities are invited to participate in small group couple-focused or men-only interactive sessions lasting 3-4 hours in which the advantages and fears associated with couples' HCT are discussed with invited couples to motivate them to consider testing together as a couple. The meetings are reinforced with testimonies from previously tested couples. At the end of the sessions couples or men receive invitation coupons which they present to a designated health facility to receive couples' HCT services (couples are free to receive individual HCT or not to honor the invitation if they are not interested in taking the HCT offer). In the comparison communities standard of care health education activities including general adult community sessions are held but couples do not receive any invitations to test as a couple. Nevertheless couples in the comparison communities have unlimited access to HIV counseling and testing services that are offered by the Rakai Health Sciences Program within the study communities. The investigators hypothesize that couples in the intervention arm will be more likely to test together than those in the comparison arm. The study objectives include: a) exploring the motivations for and barriers to couples' HCT uptake; b) assessing the effect of a demand-creation intervention on couples' HCT uptake among married couples with no prior couples' HCT experience and c) exploring the effect of couples' HCT vs. individual HCT on linkage to and retention in HIV care.    ,NCT02492061

HIV,Acceptance and Compassion to Enhance Self-care Pilot, Innovative approaches are needed to optimize the benefits of treatment as prevention (TasP) among HIV+ substance users who experience profound health disparities that amplify onward transmission risk. This project will systematically develop refine and conduct an open pilot to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a two-phase emotion regulation intervention that targets emotional barriers to HIV-related self-care among individuals who endorse active substance use. Emotional barriers such as shame and internalized stigma have been identified as barriers to optimal HIV care among individuals struggling with HIV and substance use. To effectively implement TasP strategies for addressing these barriers are needed. Utilizing transdiagnostic approaches (e.g. positive affect-focused emotional regulation mindfulness and self-compassion) investigators will develop refine and pilot a two-phase emotional regulation intervention that requires only 5 face-to-face hours and can ultimately be implemented by a case-management-level staff person or trained peer educator. The first phase of the intervention will be a multicomponent in-person intervention targeting emotional cognitive and behavioral barriers to HIV self-care behaviors among HIV+ substance users. The second phase of the intervention will extend the intervention benefits by sending personalized positive self-reappraisal text messages in response to text message queries about participants' mood. This phase will use an innovative personalized bi-directional platform which will leverage an existing text message delivery system. This project will be instrumental in developing a relatively low-resource intervention strategy to address unmet emotional barriers to optimal HIV-care among individuals who are actively using substances. This work will provide the necessary pilot data for a subsequent grant submission to assess the preliminary efficacy of the intervention. The resulting intervention has the potential to address emotional barriers to self-care along the HIV care cascade: including retention in care antiretroviral treatment adherence and persistence and ultimately viral suppression.    ,NCT02535455

HIV,Measuring and Monitoring Adherence to ART With Pill Ingestible Sensor System, Introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV-infection from a fatal to manageable disease but adherence to ART remains critical to optimize outcomes. Existing measures of ART adherence provide only inferred measures of actual drug intake and most offer no real-time notification capability. Directly observed therapy measures actual drug intake but is not practical. These limitations constrain research into medication adherence and more importantly limit our ability to develop real-time interventions based on feasible in vivo monitoring of adherence among HIV-infected people to facilitate medication-taking. The Proteus digital health feedback (PDHF) system a pill ingestible sensor based adherence measuring and monitoring system developed by Proteus Digital Health addresses these limitations. It involves use of an ingestible sensor a tiny edible material that is over-encapsulated along with prescribed medication. The sensor is activated by ingestion and is sensed by a patch worn by the patient with an embedded monitor and sensor. The monitor sends a Bluetooth signal to a mobile device which in turn sends an encrypted message to a central server thus effecting real-time monitoring that a dose has been taken. The investigators propose to develop a data receiving hub and add to these components an automated text message that is sent to the patient when a dose is missed. The investigators will evaluate the feasibility acceptability and sustainability of using the PDHF system; assess the accuracy of the PDHF system in measuring adherence to ART; and evaluate the efficacy of the PDHF system for monitoring and leveraging adherence to ART.    ,NCT02797262

HIV,Long Term Outcomes of Therapy in Women Initiated on Lifelong ART Because of Pregnancy in DR Congo, Despite the rapid adoption of the World Health Organization's 2013 guidelines many children continue to be infected with HIV perinatally because of sub-optimal adherence to the continuum of HIV care in maternal and child health clinics (MCH). To achieve the UNAIDS goal eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission multiple adaptive interventions will need to be implemented to improve adherence to the HIV continuum. The aim of this open label parallel groups randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) interventions implemented at facility and health district level to improve retention in care and virological suppression through 24 months postpartum among pregnant and breastfeeding women receiving ART in MCH clinics in Kinshasa Democratic Republic of Congo. Prior to randomization the current monitoring and evaluation system will be strengthen to enable collection of high quality individual patient-level data necessary for the timely production of indicators and monitoring of program outcomes to inform CQI interventions. Following randomization in health districts randomized to CQI quality improvement (QI) teams will be established at the district level and at MCH clinics level. For 18 months QI teams will be brought together quarterly to identified key bottlenecks in the care delivery system using data from the monitoring system develop an action plan to address those bottlenecks and implement the action plan at the level of their district or clinics. If proven to be effective CQI as designed here could be scaled up rapidly in DRC and other resource-limited settings to accelerate progress towards the goal of an AIDS free generation.    ,NCT03048669
HIV,A Couple-based HIV Prevention Intervention to Promote HIV Protection Among Latino Male Couples, Epidemiological studies have attributed the source of many new HIV and STI infections among MSM to primary partners. Despite recent emphasis on couples-based interventions efficacious interventions for Latino male couples have yet to be tested. The proposed study builds on the PI's post-doctoral research in which he adapted evidence based intervention for Black MSM couples Connect `n Unite for Latino male couples using methodologically rigorous adaptation procedures. The adapted intervention Conectado Latinos en Parejas (CLP) expands the prevention alternatives offered in previous interventions by incorporating biomedical prevention methods such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) promoting engagement in care adherence to treatment regimens and viral suppression (TasP) and encouraging routine HIV testing if appropriate given the couple's serostatus. The investigators will conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) to examine whether participants assigned to CLP report an increase in the proportion of HIV protected anal sex acts (operationalized as using condoms PrEP TasP) compared to those assigned to a Wellness Promotion (WP) time matched attention control. The investigators will recruit 150 Latino male couples from the Philadelphia MSA and randomly assign them to CLP or WP. Participants will complete ACASIs to assess behavioral and psychosocial factors and be tested for sexually transmitted infections (STI) at baseline 3 and 6 month post intervention. The investigators will conduct optional HIV/STI testing at baseline 3 and 6 month post intervention. The primary study activities will be conducted at a large Latino serving CBO in North Philadelphia. To our knowledge this study will be the first to examine the impact of a couple-based intervention to increase HIV protected anal sex acts for Latino male couples capable of being scaled up and replicated in various communities to provide continuous support and protection for this heavily impacted group.    ,NCT03048838

HIV,A Randomized Pilot Trial Evaluating the Impact of a Yoga Intervention on Cognition in Older Adults Infected With HIV, Approximately 50% of people living with HIV (and as many as 80% over the age of 50) have difficulties with cognitive functions such as memory and thinking that can have a profound negative impact on activities of daily living and quality of life. Problems with memory and thinking are also associated with forgetting to take anti-retroviral drugs and experiencing challenges to balance walking and mental health (anxiety and depression). There is increasing evidence that in the general population exercise has positive effects on cognition physical functioning and mental health. Despite the recognition of multiple therapeutic benefits of exercise little attention has been paid to its possible effects on cognition in people living with HIV. The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to compare the effects of a 12-week randomly assigned community-based yoga-mindfulness intervention on cognition balance walking mental health and quality of life in 30 people >45 years of age living with HIV in the Halifax area. Yoga is of particular interest because it encompasses not only the physical but also spiritual emotional and mental dimensions of life. As such it has tremendous potential to help stave off some of the devastating consequences of HIV infection.    ,NCT03071562
HIV,Traditional Healers as Adherence Partners for Persons Living With HIV in Rural Mozambique, The overall goal of this project is to adapt and assess the impact of a traditional healer training program/intervention on the adherence retention and viral load of HIV infected patients newly initiated on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in rural Mozambique.    ,NCT03076359
HIV,YouthPower Action Feasibility Study of Online Support Group Intervention Among Adolescents Living With HIV in Nigeria, This study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention designed to improve retention in HIV care services and improve anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence among adolescents ages 15-19 years living with HIV enrolled in ART services.    ,NCT03076996
HIV,Improving Engagement in HIV Care for High-risk Women, Transgender women (assigned 'male' at birth but who do not identify as male) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and have culturally unique barriers and facilitators to engagement in HIV care. Transgender women living with HIV (TWH) are less likely than others to take antiretroviral therapy (ART) and those who initiate ART have lower rates of ART adherence lower self-efficacy for integrating ART into daily routines and report fewer positive interactions with health care providers than non-transgender adults. As a result TWH have an almost three-fold higher viral load than non-transgender adults in San Francisco; in Los Angeles TWH are less likely to be virally suppressed than any other behavioral risk group. In formative work the investigators have identified culturally-specific and modifiable barriers to HIV treatment engagement among TWH including prioritization of transition-related health care (i.e. hormone therapy) at the expense of HIV treatment avoidance of HIV care settings due to past negative health care experiences misinformation about ART including potential drug interactions with hormones intensified HIV stigma low levels of social support and poor coping skills. There are both individual and public health consequences to poor engagement in care among TWH stemming from high transmission risk factors including substance abuse high numbers of sex partners engagement in sex work and high rates of mental illness. These findings strongly suggest that TWH face unique challenges to engaging in and adhering to HIV treatment and that the public health consequences for poor engagement in this population are of grave concern. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to engagement in care are critical in efforts to alter the pattern of HIV-related disparities that lead to disproportionately poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable and marginalized population. The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial of a theory-driven population-specific piloted intervention to improve engagement in care for TWH. Grounded in the investigators' Models of Gender Affirmation and Health Care Empowerment the proposed research is the first to systematically intervene on complex barriers to optimal engagement in HIV care for TWH. The investigators have developed and piloted the Healthy Divas intervention to optimize engagement in HIV care for TWH at elevated risk for treatment failure and consequential morbidity mortality and transmission of HIV.    ,NCT03081559
HIV,"""Switch Either at Suppression Or THOusand""", This trial addresses the question of the viral load (VL) threshold for switching from first-line to second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). The WHO currently sets the threshold at 1000 copies/mL. However the optimal threshold for defining virological failure and the need to switch ART regimen has not been determined. In fact people with VL levels of less than 1000 copies/mL however not fully suppressed are at increased risk for drug resistance mutations (DRM) and subsequent virological failure. In resource-limited settings where VL monitoring is not as frequent as in high-income countries this could have serious implications and patients may continue on a failing regimen for a long period. Our research consortium will conduct a multi-center parallel-group open-label randomized clinical trial in a resource-limited setting to assess whether a threshold of 100 copies/mL compared to the WHO-defined threshold of 1000 copies/mL for switching to second-line ART among unsuppressed HIV-positive patients on first-line ART will lead to better outcomes.    ,NCT03088241
HIV,Neuropsychological Outcomes of Internationally-Adopted Children Who Are Perinatally-Infected With Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Children who are perinatally-infected with HIV are extremely vulnerable to cognitive delays and psychiatric disease and the risk for neuropsychiatric illness is compounded in children who are internationally-adopted and may have suffered trauma abandonment malnutrition and neglect. While cognitive and psychiatric issues have been described in HIV-infected children and even more so in HIV-positive adults there have been no reports on neuropsychiatric interventions that can improve cognitive and psychiatric states in this highly vulnerable population. Without these needed data Pediatric HIV providers have not been able to advocate for optimal neuropsychiatric care in perinatally HIV-infected children let alone those who has suffered the additional risk of being internationally adopted. In the proposed study the investigators will report on the neuropsychological profiles and outcomes in a cohort of internationally-adopted perinatally HIV-infected children between ages 6 to 16 years who have not previously undergone neuropsychological testing or treatment. Data obtained from this study will provide important contributions to the literature by building understanding of the complex needs of this population as well as guiding future intervention efforts. The investigators predict that intervention efforts aimed at helping educators understand the learning and cognitive challenges for many of our patients will guide targeted academic supports in the school setting and lead to gains in academic skills. The detailed information obtained during the comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and follow-up care will be shared with the child's key educators at school so that individualized educational strategies can be developed while maintaining confidentiality regarding the child's HIV status.    ,NCT03100331

HIV,Evaluating the Impact of a Community Health Worker Program in Neno Malawi, This protocol concerns the implementation and evaluation of an intervention designed to realign the existing cadre of Community Health Workers (CHW) in Neno District Malawi to better support the care needs of the clients they serve. The proposed intervention is a 'Household Model' where CHWs will be assigned to households rather than HIV or TB specific patients and will be trained to provide support for a wider range of conditions including HIV hypertension diabetes and pediatric malnutrition. The new model is designed to improve retention in care for clients with chronic non-communicable diseases along with increased uptake of women's health services and treatment for pediatric malnutrition while sustaining the high retention rates for clients in the HIV program. Eleven sites (health centres and hospitals) were arranged into six clusters by estimated size of the catchment area populations with a population range of 11680 to 26260 and an average population of 20400. The order in which the intervention will be rolled out across the sites will be randomized so that the intervention can be evaluated in a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. These clusters were grouped based mostly on geographic location but also on catchment area sizes in order to maximize feasibility of training for the CHW team and not overload CHW training sessions with too many trainees.    ,NCT03106727
HIV,Strategies for the Prevention of Hepatitis B Among HIV Infected Patients in Uganda, The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two vaccination strategies against Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in subjects already infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Researchers plan to determine the optimal vaccination strategy for achieving protective immunity to HBV infection in HIV-infected adults attending Mulago Hospital's HIV care clinic. Primary objectives are to assess:   1. The role of CD4-cell count and HIV viral loads on the HBV vaccine response.   2. The role of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the HBV vaccine response. The secondary objective is to evaluate whether lack of HAART is associated with high rates of loss to follow-up.    ,NCT02316444
HIV,Evaluating a Microfinance Intervention for Vulnerable Women in Kazakhstan, This study will examine the efficacy of a combined HIV and microfinance intervention to reduce biologically confirmed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and new incidence of HIV and HCV as well as reported sexual and drug risk behaviors among 520 women who have injected drugs in the past year and who engage in sex trading in Temirtau and Pavlodar Kazakhstan. The proposed study builds on findings from an R34 by the investigative team testing a combination HIV prevention and microfinance intervention. Building on successful protocols and significant results we will randomly assign 520 women who inject drugs and engage in sex trading from Temirtau and Pavlodar Kazakhstan to either (1) a 4 session HIV prevention intervention combined with a 6 session financial literacy intervention enrollment in an existing vocational training program and receipt of matched savings (HIVRR+MF); or to the 4 session HIV prevention intervention alone. The HIVRR intervention is guided by social cognitive theory. The HIVRR+MF intervention integrates asset theory with social cognitive theory. The MF includes: 1) financial literacy; 2) vocational training; and 3) micro-savings to support transition to a more permanent employment status. We hypothesize that increasing financial literacy enhancing vocational skills required to fill marketable positions in the local economy and beginning a personal savings program combined with HIV risk reduction will lead to significant reductions in study outcomes compared to an HIVRR intervention without a microfinance intervention.    ,NCT02406482

HIV,Puerto Rico Cuidalos Parent-adolescent Program," Latino adolescents are at high risk for HIV/AIDS other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies. Puerto Rican adolescents in particular experience disparities in these areas yet few adolescent and even fewer parent interventions have been developed to address these important issues with this underserved population. Parent-adolescent programs are an effective approach to reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior and associated negative consequences. A web-based parent communication intervention provides an opportunity to strengthen and enhance programs that are designed for adolescents by providing additional support for safer sex decisions and to increase parents' access to sexual health education programs by decreasing barriers that keep them from participating in these interventions (e.g. low cost can be viewed privately at parents convenience minimizes competing time with work and family). The purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate a brief theoretically informed (i.e. Ecodevelopmental Theory Theory of Reasoned Action/Planned Behavior Social Cognitive Theory 1-6) culturally appropriate and linguistically tailored web-based parental communication program CuÃ­dalos (""Take care of them"") designed to improve parent-adolescent sexual communication and reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior. Recent findings from an NIH funded R21 randomized control trial (RCT) testing a brief computer-based version of the CuÃ­dalos program indicated that the program increased parent-adolescent general communication and sexual risk communication with English and Spanish speaking U.S. Latinos. Further despite limited or no previous computer use parents reported they liked and learned from the program and that it was easy to use and accessible.    ",NCT03063385

HIV,Adherence to HIV Therapy in Heroin Addicts: Oral vs. Extended Release Naltrexone, Substance use particularly the compulsive behaviors associated with addiction lead to unhealthy behaviors including non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and treatment failure. High on the list of disorders leading to non-adherence is heroin addiction as a wide range of impulsive high-risk behaviors accompanies it. The science of adherence would be improved by developing new methods to prevent relapse to heroin addiction especially methods that can be used in settings that are not limited by the aims to test such a method using an implantable naltrexone formulation (IN) that is approved in Russia and blocks opioid effects for 3 months. The efficacy of the IN should be better than oral naltrexone (ON) because it does not depend on daily behavior to take a tablet and maintains a constant plasma level for months which should result in sustained blockade less relapse and better ART adherence and treatment response.    ,NCT02046252
HIV,Cell Phone Technology Targeting ART and Naltrexone Adherence and Alcohol Use, The proposed study for HIV positive alcohol dependent adults currently taking naltrexone is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the outcomes of a 12-week behavioral support program delivered via text-messaging. It is expected that the text messaging intervention will reduce alcohol use and HIV-risk behaviors. The investigators also hypothesize that the intervention will improve adherence to HIV treatment and naltrexone. To test the effects of the intervention on these target outcomes 25 participants receiving the text messaging intervention will be compared to 25 participants receiving an informational pamphlet. The pamphlet will contain information about the importance of HIV treatment adherence reducing HIV risk behaviors and health consequences associated with alcohol use. By providing support to maximize HIV treatment regimen and naltrexone adherence coupled with coping skills to promote abstinence from alcohol the text messaging intervention may provide a promising cost-effective and easily deployable behavioral support program for alcohol users who are HIV-infected.    ,NCT02603471

HIV,Trial of Maraviroc (UK-427857) in Combination With Zidovudine/Lamivudine Versus Efavirenz in Combination With Zidovudine/Lamivudine, Maraviroc (UK-427857) a selective and reversible CCR5 coreceptor antagonist has been shown to be active in vitro against a wide range of clinical isolates (including those resistant to existing classes). In HIV-1 infected patients maraviroc (UK-427857) given as monotherapy for 10 days reduced HIV-1 viral load by up to 1.6 log consistent with currently available agents. Safety and toleration have been studied in over 400 subjects for up to 28 days at 300 mg twice daily. No significant effects were seen on the QTc interval. The goal of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of maraviroc (UK-427857) versus efavirenz when each are combined with two other antiretroviral agents in patients who are previously naive to antiretroviral therapy. This study will involve approximately 200 centers from around the world to achieve a total randomized subject population of 1071 subjects. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: maraviroc (UK-427857) 300 mg once daily added to zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily) Maraviroc (UK-427857) 300 mg twice daily added to zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily) or efavirenz (600 mg once daily) added to zidovudine/lamivudine (300 mg/150 mg twice daily).

HIV,Effect Of A CCR5 Coreceptor Antagonist On The Latency And Reservoir Of HIV-1, The presence of a pool of cells latently infected by HIV-1 in patients taking HAART and with a viral load below 50 copies/mL is the main limitation to eradication of the virus from the body. This viral reservoir prevents antiretroviral therapy from being interrupted; therefore patients are obliged to continue with treatment for a period calculated to be greater than 60 years. Despite the important advances in knowledge of the biology of this reservoir we still have no real knowledge about its dynamics. The opportunity to carry out a clinical trial for the first time with CCR5 coreceptor antagonists is exceptional since the results could provide important information on the nature of this reservoir. If maintenance of the reservoir is a dynamic process inclusion of CCR5 inhibitors is expected to lead to a reduction in the size of this reservoir. This effect could be critical when including IAT (viral reactivation) since in theory it would be necessary to act on a smaller reservoir. Current consensus is that it would be necessary to act on almost 100% of the viral reservoir (approximately 1000000 cells). The study has also been designed to enable us to understand the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which certain drugs can induce viral reactivation in vitro as a previous step to a clinical trial aimed at reactivating viral latency and eradicating HIV-1 from the body.    ,NCT00795444

Despite the important advances in knowledge of the biology of this reservoir we still have no real knowledge about its dynamics. The opportunity to carry out a clinical trial for the first time with an integrase inhibitor is exceptional since the results could provide important information on the nature of this reservoir. If maintenance of the reservoir is a dynamic process inclusion of an integrase inhibitor is expected to lead to a reduction in the size of this reservoir. This effect could be critical when including IAT (viral reactivation) since in theory it would be necessary to act on a smaller reservoir. Current consensus is that it would be necessary to act on almost 100% of the viral reservoir (approximately 1000000 cells). The study has also been designed to enable us to understand the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which certain drugs can induce viral reactivation in vitro as a previous step to a clinical trial aimed at reactivating viral latency and eradicating HIV-1 from the body.    ,NCT00807443

HIV,Dermal HIV-1 Immunization During Anti-retroviral Therapy Followed by Repeated Treatment Interruptions, In this study the investigators evaluated a therapeutic HIV-1 DNA vaccine administered with a novel topical application method to 12 chronically HIV-infected cART treated patients. The HIV DNA plasmids used in this study encode for envelope gp160 of HIV-1 subtypes A B and C rev B Gag A and B and reverse transcriptase (RT) B. The patients were randomly assigned to three groups; group 1 (n=4) were immunized six times with 0.4 mg of HIV DNA plasmids topically group 2 (n=4) were immunized six times with 0.4 mg of HIV DNA plasmids topically and treated with 500 mg of hydroxyurea daily until visit 10 group 3 (n=4) four patients received placebo. The immunization was performed during three cycles of 7 weeks of cART followed by four weeks of therapy interruption. After the last cycle of cART the patients were maintained on a definitive treatment interruption until CD4+ T cell counts dropped below 350/ mm3 at two time points. Cellular and humoral immune responses viral load and CD4+ T a cell count was analysed throughout the study.    ,NCT01140139
HIV,Impact of Raltegravir on HIV-1 cDNA Slope Following Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Initiation, Recent clinical trials of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) containing the first approved integrase inhibitor (i.e. raltegravir) have demonstrated a more rapid decay of HIV-1 RNA in plasma compared to conventional potent antiretroviral combinations. This was observed especially during the early phase (up to week 12) following initiation of cART. To explain this two mechanistic hypotheses have been developed:   1. - Macrophage reservoir death hypothesis. A major source of virus production during the second phase decay are believed to be long-lived infected cells with continuous virus production - e.g. macrophages. An accumulation of unintegrated episomal HIV-1 cDNAs can promote apoptosis (Li et al. Embo J. 2001;20: 3272). In case of HIV superinfection of such a productively infected cell an INI-based cART may induce apoptosis and thus contribute to a decrease in HIV RNA load during second phase decay. However no study has thus far addressed the consequences of INI treatment on HIV-1 cDNA species on any cell population in vivo.   2. - Resting CD4 T-cell reservoir integration block hypothesis. Resting CD4 T-cells may represent a substantial reservoir for HIV replication during the second phase decay as well. A special characteristic of these cells is that HIV-1 cDNA is typically localized to the nucleus in a not-integrated form (Chun et al. PNAS 1997;94:13193). These resting cells likely integrate HIV-DNA upon activation and then contribute to HIV viremia and viral spread. Conceptually integration could be prevented by RGV but not by RTI or PI. An accumulation of circular episomal HIV-1 cDNA species may also be a consequence of RGV treatment in this cell type. Patient disposition: To explore raltegravir-induced shifts in HIV-1 cDNA species in vivo this non-interventional clinical observation investigates the dynamics of the three major HIV-1 cDNA species (total HIV-1 cDNA HIV-1 integrants in the host cell genome episomal HIV-1 2-LTR circles) over a period of 4 months in two groups of patients starting off cART from a single study center. Patients who begin cART in regular clinical routine with 2N(t)RTI plus either (n=10 patients) raltegravir or (n=10 patients) a boosted protease inhibitor/ alternatively an NNRTI will be offered to participate in this observation. Only patients are offered to participate in this trial if no other antiretroviral drugs than the above mentioned and no concomitant drugs with relevant impact on antiretroviral's pharmacokinetics are administered. At time of study inclusion patients should be characterised by a HIV-1 RNA load of >5000 copies/mL and CD4-cell count of >200/ÂµL within 12 weeks before cART initiation. Preliminary analyses of PBMCs from HIV-infected patients indicate that all three major HIV-1 cDNA species can be quantified by real-time PCR under these baseline conditions.    ,NCT01168167
HIV,Intrauterine Insemination In HIV-Discordant Couples, This study aims to assess the feasibility of a novel standard of care technique for intrauterine insemination (IUI) in HIV-discordant couples in the United States. This study will involve couples in which the male partner is HIV positive but the female partner is negative. The investigators will institute a protocol similar to those used presently throughout Europe with good success. To date no HIV seroconversions have occurred in over 4000 inseminations performed in HIV serodiscordant couples. All male subjects will be on stable HAART and have undetectable serum viral loads prior to insemination. Semen samples will be subjected to a stringent sperm wash procedure and screened for HIV RNA. Female subjects will be followed post-insemination for seroconversion and pregnancy. Infants will be followed for seroconversion at birth through 4 months of age.    ,NCT01173276

HIV,PI or NNRTI as First-line Treatment of HIV in West Africa - the PIONA Trial, BACKGROUND: Since 1996 the combination of three or more drugs has been the mainstay of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. The most important types of drugs are called nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) Response to treatment is measured as increasing CD4+ cell count and decreasing HIV viral load. A major problem is the development of resistance. NNRTIs are recommended as part of first-line treatment of HIV in Africa but many Africans have a slower NNRTI clearance than Caucasians making them more susceptible for development of resistance in case of treatment interruptions. PIs might therefore be a better option in an African setting with low adherence. AIM: To evaluate two different treatment regimens in HIV-1 infected patients: A) A NNRTI (efavirenz/nevirapine) based regimen and B) A PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir) based regimen with regard to treatment outcomes. HYPOTHESIS: Treatment with a PI will be superior to treatment with a NNRTI due to less development of resistance. METHODS: Treatment-naÃ¯ve adult HIV-1 patients enrolled in an existing cohort The West African Retrovirus and Acquired Immune Deficiency (WARAID) cohort in Guinea Bissau with CD4+ cell count ??350 cells/ÂµL and/or clinical signs of immune suppression (World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage 3 or 4) will be randomised 1:1 to: Treatment A: 2 NRTIs (lamivudine and either zidovudine or stavudine) and 1 NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine) or Treatment B: 2 NRTIs (same as in treatment A) and 1 PI (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir). Primary outcome: Viral load suppression <400 copies/ml 12 months after enrolment. PERSPECTIVES: Guidelines for treatment of HIV in Africa are more or less a copy of the guidelines used in Europe and North America. Genetic differences in pharmacokinetics more women infected in Africa and difficulties ensuring good adherence mean that results obtained from Caucasian patients are not directly transferrable to African patients. The results of this study will hopefully help guiding the treatment of HIV in Africa in the future. The investigators believe the HIV infected people in West Africa deserve the same evidence-based medicine as in developed countries.    ,NCT01192035

HIV,Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders in HIV Infected Children and Adolescent, The advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment has resulted in the survival into adolescence of an increasing proportion of infants and children with perinatal HIV infection in Senegal. However the transformation of HIV into a chronic disease needing lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART) raises new challenges among others related to a disturbance of glucose metabolism lipid abnormalities in addition to the potential effects on children's growth and puberty. Little is known on nutritional and metabolic changes in HIV-infected children on ART in Africa while implementation of the latest WHO recommendations should eventually lead to an increase in the number of children on ART in this region. Moreover bio-clinical evolution of untreated children is poorly documented in the African context. It therefore urgently needed to institute a cohort study to evaluate in the long term the impact of HIV infection and/or ART on nutritional and metabolic disorders and to characterize the risk factors of their occurrence in children and adolescents infected as they move through adolescent into adulthood.    ,NCT01771562

The study hypothesizes that acyclovir will reduce HIV shedding from mucosal surfaces of HIV-1/HSV-2 coinfected individuals.    ,NCT00209313
HIV,Enhancement by Poly-ICLC During HIV-1 Infection," This study involves researching new approaches to treating HIV infection. Currently HIV infection is treated with combinations of drugs called antiretrovirals. These drugs protect cells from infection by interfering with the viruses' ability to make copies of itself by infecting new target cells. Though these drugs are very effective they cannot cure HIV infection and must be taken each and every day at prescribed doses to maintain their beneficial effect. This research study is investigating a new approach that involves an addition to existing medications. The study is investigating a medication called Poly-ICLC (HiltonolÂ® Oncovir) which is an adjuvant. Adjuvants are medications that are designed to boost your body's immune responses resulting from a vaccine. The investigators want to test whether Poly-ICLC is an adjuvant that is effective in HIV-infected patients. A vaccine is not given in this study but just investigating the adjuvant Poly-ICLC to determine whether it may be safe and useful in future vaccines that could be used to treat HIV called therapeutic vaccines. One goal of future therapeutic vaccines is to reduce the virus that remains persistently inside of cells in a dormant or resting state despite treatment with HIV medications. This persistent pool is termed the ""latent virus pool"" or ""viral reservoir"". One tactic to reduce this viral reservoir is to first stimulate HIV to start replicating in order to force it out of hiding. Once viral replication occurs the infected cells may then be recognized and killed by cells of the immune system. Therefore we also want to see what effect Poly-ICLC has on the virus that lives inside of cells. Specifically the investigators want to look at whether Poly-ICLC increases the level of virus inside your cells while also improving your immune system's responses. The investigators are doing this research in hope to find new ways to treat HIV infection that may reduce exposure to medications that are called antiretrovirals.

HIV,Study of Protease Inhibitor Regimen Switch in HIV-1 Infected Patients With Undetectable Viral Load to Prove the Non-inferiority of Once Daily Dose Regimen Versus the Current Twice Daily Regimen to Maintain the Viral Load Under the Limit of Detection., Darunavir boosted with ritonavir (darunavir/r) is a powerful protease inhibitor able to reduce the viral load in patients infected with multi-resistant HIV strains; In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the induction of resistance mutations in the protease gene is much more difficult with the association darunavir/r compared to the other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r) testifying of a significantly higher genetic barrier to resistance. Moreover the tolerance to darunavir is good and the pharmacologic profile of this molecule allows a once daily administration with a 800/100 mg dose in patients infected with a wild HIV strain or with a slightly resistant to darunavir/r strain. Thus we propose to evaluate the efficacy of the darunavir/r association once daily as a substitute to a protease inhibitor regimen administered twice daily in patients with undetectable viral load receiving a tritherapy including a protease inhibitor administered twice daily.    ,NCT00849160

HIV,Study of PENNVAX??B (Gag Pol Env) + Electroporation in HIV-1 Infected Adult Participants, DNA vaccines consist of small pieces of DNA also known as plasmids and have several potential advantages over traditional vaccines. Thus far DNA vaccines appear to be well tolerated in humans. We have developed DNA vaccine PENNVAX-B which includes plasmids targeting the gag pol and env proteins of HIV-1. The vaccine will be delivered via electroporation (EP) which uses the CELLECTRA constant current device to deliver a small electric charge following injection since animal studies have shown that this delivery method increases the immune response to vaccine. The vaccine will be given to HIV-1 infected subjects whose viral load is undetectable on a HAART regimen with CD4 lymphocyte count above 400 cells/ÂµL of blood. It is hypothesized that PENNVAX-B + EP will be safe and well tolerated.    ,NCT01082692

HIV,DCVax Plus Poly ICLC in Healthy Volunteers, DCVax-001 is a recombinant protein vaccine designed to prevent and potentially treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The vaccine is composed of a fusion protein containing a human monoclonal antibody specific for the dendritic cell receptor DEC-205 (CD205) and the HIV gag p24 protein. The vaccine is designed to target HIV antigens directly to endocytic pathways in dendritic cells (DCs) that allow for efficient processing and presentation of multiple HIV peptides on both MHC class I and II products which will induce HIV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. This vaccine candidate must be combined with appropriate immunostimulants (adjuvants) to induce immunity to the antigen. In the proposed clinical trial we will use poly ICLC (Hiltonol) from Oncovir Inc as the adjuvant.    ,NCT01127464
HIV,Novel Interventions in HIV-1 Infection, For several years there has been interest in why some people with HIV-1 progress more slowly to disease and have longer survival without Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) than others. The investigators and others have identified a few HIV positive individuals who can control their viral load for many years without HAART these rare individuals do not lose their HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses which are very important for controlling viral load. This group is referred to as long-term non-progressors (LTNP). Unlike LTNP the majority of HIV-1 infected individuals are chronic progressors (CP) who do not make effective HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses even when on HAART. We propose to use a novel DNA vaccine boosted with immune based therapy (cytokines and hormones) to try to regenerate the missing HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses to make chronically infected HIV-1+ persons more like LTNP. By injecting this novel DNA vaccine and immune based therapy into the people who are already infected with HIV-1 the immune system may be stimulated to mount a greater immune response not only to the vaccines but also to real HIV-1 particles and HIV-1-infected cells.    ,NCT01130376

HIV,Effect of Maraviroc (MCV) on the Immunological Recovery of HIV-1 Discordant Patients With CD4 Lymphocyte Counts Below 200 Cells/mm3, Maraviroc is an antiretroviral drug that belongs to the family of the CCR5 coreceptor inhibitors. It has proven to be effective in increasing CD4 lymphocyte counts in both in treated and naÃ¯ve patients irrespective of the viral load. The investigators hypothesize that adding Maraviroc to the antiretroviral treatment of discordant patients defined as those having CD4 lymphocyte counts below 200 cells /mm3 during the last year could lead to its immunological recovery. 60 patients will be included in this unicentric prospective randomized and stratified clinical trial. They will be randomized to either continue with its usual high activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART) treatment or to receive 300 mg of Maraviroc every 12 hours plus its usual treatment. After 24 weeks lymphocyte counts will be assessed as well as safety clinical progression immunological profile of the patients and the potential benefit of Maraviroc for HIV+ cirrhotic patients.    ,NCT01235013
HIV,Study to Evaluate Switching From Regimens Consisting of a Ritonavir-boosted Protease Inhibitor (PI) and Two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) to a Fixed-dose Tablet Containing Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine/Tenofovir DF, The purpose of this randomized open-label multicenter active-controlled Phase 3b study is to evaluate the noninferiority of the emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF) single-tablet regimen (STR; also referred to as fixed-dose regimen or fixed-dose tablet) relative to regimens consisting of a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI+RTV) and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected subjects. The FTC/RPV/TDF STR could offer an attractive treatment option to patients who wish to simplify dosing by reducing pill burden or to improve the tolerability of their treatment. Participants will be randomized into 2 groups the FTC/RPV/TDF STR group in which participants will switch treatment regimens at the start of the study and the Stay on Baseline Regimen (SBR)/Delayed Switch group in which participants will remain on their baseline regimen during the first 24 weeks of the study (designed to provide an initial active control) and may switch to the FTC/RPV/TDF STR at the Week 24 visit.

HIV,HPV Test-and-Treat-Strategy Versus Cytology-based Strategy for Prevention of CIN2+ in HIV-Infected Women, Women sometimes develop cancer in an area called the cervix which is the opening to the uterus or womb. Women who have HIV are more likely to get this kind of cancer than women who do not have HIV. Nearly all of these cancers are caused by another virus called human papilloma virus (or HPV). Other times the cause of this cancer is not known. The investigators are looking for a better way to prevent cervical cancer. This study is comparing two different methods to prevent cancer of the cervix in women who have HIV. This study will also see if these methods are safe and tolerable in women who have HIV.    ,NCT01315353

HIV,Atorvastatin on Biomarkers of Inflammation Coagulopathy Angiogenesis & T-cells, ACTG A5275 was a prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design pilot study evaluating the effect of atorvastatin on biomarkers of inflammation coagulopathy angiogenesis and T-lymphocyte activation in HIV-1 infected individuals with suppressed HIV-1 RNA on stable protease inhibitor based antiretroviral therapy with fasting LDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dL. Atorvastatin is a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating high cholesterol. Atorvastatin has also been able to lower the level of inflammation blood tests in certain other diseases but has not been studied for this purpose in people who have HIV. The main goal of this experimental study is to see how taking atorvastatin affects inflammation blood tests in people infected with HIV who do not need to take medicine for high cholesterol. In addition to observing the effects of atorvastatin on the level of inflammation measured in the blood this study evaluated if atorvastatin is safe for people with HIV who are also taking medication for HIV.    ,NCT01351025
HIV,Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Alone or With Delayed Chemo Versus ART With Immediate Chemo for Limited AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) occurs in persons with HIV infection who are also infected with the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV). Several chemotherapy (anti-cancer) drugs work well in treating KS but there is no treatment that cures KSHV infection. One chemotherapy drug called etoposide (VePesidÂ® ET) has caused KS tumors to get smaller in some people. Antiretroviral therapy (anti-HIV drugs or ART) is a group of medicines taken together to treat HIV infection. These medicines help to stop HIV from growing in the body. When this happens your immune system which fights infection and some cancers like KS will get stronger. For some people limited stage KS often improves or stays the same when they take ART. However in some people KS gets worse when taking ART. These people may need chemotherapy at a later date. This study is being done to find out if taking ART with immediate etoposide (ET) is better than taking ART alone or ART with delayed ET to treat limited stage KS. The study will also try to better understand KSHV and to see what kind of side effects are caused by ART and ET and how safe ART and ET are.    ,NCT01352117
HIV,Study of Options for Second-Line Effective Combination Therapy (SELECT), The study was conducted on people who were taking their first anti-HIV drug regimen (including an Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) a type of anti-HIV drug) but the drugs in this regimen were not doing a good job of fighting their HIV infection. The main purpose of this study was to compare two other anti-HIV drug regimens to see how well they fight HIV. The study also looked at how well participants tolerate the drug regimens and how safe they are. The study was designed to determine whether taking the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus raltegravir (RAL) works as well as what is usually used for second-line therapy: LPV/r plus the best-available nucleoside (nucleotide) reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) combination. Testing a regimen that does not include any NRTIs was important because NRTIs may no longer work for patients who received them as part of their first treatment regimen.    ,NCT01352715

HIV,High Dose Vitamin D and Calcium for Bone Health in Individuals Initiating HAART, This study was done with people who were infected with HIV and needed to start treatment for their HIV disease. The purpose of this study is to see if taking vitamin D and calcium will help prevent the bone loss that sometimes happens when people start HIV treatment. For this study the following HIV treatment (or HAART) were provided in the form of a single tablet that contains three different drugs: efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (EFV/FTC/TDF). These drugs are approved by the FDA to treat HIV infection. The HIV treatment provided is common for people who are taking HIV drugs for the first time. The risks seen with this HIV treatment are the same that you would encounter when taking these drugs outside of the study. The lists of risks of this HIV treatment are included in this document because the drugs are provided by the study not because the drugs are being tested. The purpose of the study is only to look at the impact of high doses of vitamin D and calcium in preventing bone loss. There are no study objectives related to HIV treatment (EFV/FTC/TDF).    ,NCT01403051
HIV,Endothelial Function Lipoproteins and Inflammation With Low HDL Cholesterol in HIV: ER Niacin Versus Fenofibrate," This study is being done with people with HIV infection who have low levels of HDL-C. HDL-C is a type of ""good"" cholesterol. People with low HDL-C have a higher risk of heart disease and may have problems with how their blood vessels relax. The endothelium is the inner lining of all blood vessels such as arteries and veins. When the endothelium is not working properly the blood vessels have trouble expanding properly which contributes to the development of heart and blood vessel disease. The main purpose of this study is to see if taking either extended-release niacin or fenofibrate for 24 weeks will help blood vessels work better by improving endothelial function and increasing HDL-C. Niacin and fenofibrate are medications that raise HDL-C. This study will also help determine how safe extended-release niacin and fenofibrate are. The analysis is an as-treated analysis of participants who completed study treatment and had a week 24 BART scan. Safety analyses include all participants    ",NCT01426438
HIV,Gentian Violet Vs. Nystatin Oral Suspension for Treatment of Oropharyngeal Candidiasis, The purpose of this study was to see which one of two medicines (topical gentian violet [GV] or nystatin oral suspension) was better than the other in treating Oral Candidiasis (OC). This was measured by whether the study participant still had OC or sores in his/her mouth after 14 days of treatment. Also safety and tolerability of GV and nystatin in the treatment of OC were assessed.    ,NCT01427738

HIV,Reducing Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk in HIV on Antiretroviral Therapy Over 12 Months, This is a cohort study which follows two groups of participants over a 12 months period. One group will access a team approach to care with the aim of reducing their cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks from a team of doctors nurses and health care professionals. The other group will continue to access standard care from their treating doctor. Both groups will have CVD risk score evaluated after a 12 month period. The team care approach will involve specific tests to measure CVD risk as well as smoking cessation exercise and dietary advice and support including monitoring such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels    ,NCT01436136
HIV,The Effect of Probiotics in HIV-1 Infection, HIV progression is closely associated with chronic immune activation driven by leakage of bacterial products from a damaged gut the investigators largest immunological organ. Notably the degree of immune activation has been suggested to be a better predictor of disease progression than plasma viral load and markers of immune activation and gut damage have been identified as therapeutic targets per se. The major damage by HIV to the immune system is an initial massacre of gut mucosal CD4+ Th17 cells. Interestingly a normal gut flora has been shown to induce the maturation of Th17 cells in the small intestine mucosa. Preliminary reports have shown that the gut flora is altered in HIV-1 infection compared to controls. In this project the investigators will characterize microbial composition of gut flora in chronic HIV infection with ultradeep sequencing. Gut flora composition will be related to clinical data as well as quantitative data of circulating microbial products and activation markers. Second in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) the effect of probiotic lactobacilli on HIV pathogenesis and progression will be tested. This Gram-positive strain is clinically tested and is able to colonize the gut.    ,NCT01439841
HIV,Renal Transplantation and Raltegravir in HIV-Infected Patients, The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of acute renal graft rejection 6 months after transplantation in HIV-infected patients under three antiretroviral drugs regimen including Raltegravir.    ,NCT01453192
HIV,Rifaximin as a Modulator of Microbial Translocation and Immune Activation, This study is being done to see whether rifaximin an antibiotic that works in the intestines can lower the amount of germs in the intestines of HIV infected persons. It is possible that when the amount of these germs is lowered an HIV-infected person's immune system will become less active and will have a better chance of recovering. Also the study will evaluate the safety of using rifaximin in HIV-infected subjects.    ,NCT01466595

HIV,Laboratory Study of Licensed H1N1 Influenza Vaccines in HIV-1 Perinatally Infected Children and Youth," The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the immune response to the H1N1 influenza or ""flu"" vaccine. The ""immune response"" is how your body recognizes and defends itself against bacteria viruses and substances that may be harmful to the body. HIV-1 infected children typically respond more poorly to vaccines compared to uninfected healthy children and so this study hopes to learn whether or not the body will successfully produce enough antibodies (proteins that fight infection) that will prevent or fight the H1N1 flu virus. There is no information yet on the safety or immune response to this vaccine in children infected with HIV.    ",NCT01484522
HIV,Safety Efficacy and Dose-response Study of BMS-986001 in Subjects With HIV-1 Infection Who Are Treatment-naive, The purpose of this study is to identify at least one dose of BMS-986001 which is safe well tolerated and efficacious when combined with Efavirenz (EFV) + Lamivudine (3TC) for treatment-naive Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) infected subjects    ,NCT01489046
HIV,Lipopeptide Immunisation With GTU-multiHIV Trial," The combination of GTU-MultiHIV B DNA and LIPO-5 vaccines in a prime-boost strategy is expected to induce strong and diverse HIV-specific immune responses in HIV-infected patients. The investigators will carry out the clinical therapeutic immunization ""proof of concept"" trial in HIV infected patients. The investigators propose a multi-center double blind randomized versus placebo phase II clinical trial in patients who are chronic asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with undetectable viral load while treated with a potent combination of antiviral drugs. Patients will continue antiviral therapy combined with either therapeutic vaccination or placebo vaccination. Patients will undergo the procedure which includes a prime with the GTU-MultiHIV B DNA vaccine or placebo administered by IM injections via Biojector (a needle-free injection system) followed by a boost of LIPO-5 vaccine or placebo also given IM. In total 105 HIV-1 patients will be enrolled: 35 in the placebo arm and 70 in the vaccine arm. Patients will receive antiretroviral treatments and 3 administrations of DNA vaccine or its placebo at weeks 0 4 and 12 (corresponding to prime vaccinations). They also receive 2 doses of LIPO-5 vaccines or its placebo at week 20 and 24 (corresponding to boost vaccinations). At week 36 antiretroviral treatments will be interrupted until week 48. Patients will be intensely monitored during the treatment interruption period. After start of cART treatment (at the latest in W48) a data collection from clinical car will be carried out. A blood sample with W74 will allow to study the persistence ot the immunizing responses 1 year after the injection of the last vaccine/placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint is a plasma HIV-1 RNA level at week 48 (e.g. 12 weeks after stopping all antiviral treatment). The main hypothesis for conducting a phase II randomized trial is that immune responses in vaccinated patients may be associated with a better control of viral replication following c-ART interruption as compared to placebo-vaccinated patients.

HIV,Efficacy of Atazanavir/Ritonavir Monotherapy as Maintenance in Patients With Viral Suppression, The study will assess whether Atazanavir/ritonavir monotherapy provides a non-inferior proportion of virological efficacy with respect to ATV/RTV + 2 NRTIs in patients with stable suppressed viremia and no prior virologic failures.    ,NCT01511809
HIV,Effect of HAART Vs. Statin Treatment on Endothelial Function and Inflammation/Coagulation, Since people started taking HIV medications illnesses related to AIDS have decreased but other serious illnesses like heart disease (heart attacks) and certain kinds of cancer have increased. Studies show that HIV causes changes in the lining of the arteries and also causes inflammation (irritation) inside the body that may play a role in diseases like heart attacks and strokes. The levels of inflammation and artery lining health can also affect how well your brain works. These changes cannot be felt but can be measured. Artery lining health can be looked at with a test that uses a blood pressure cuff on your arm to see how the artery responds when air is let in and out of the cuff. An ultrasound (machine that uses sound waves) is used to look at the artery during the test. This test is called Flow Mediated Dilation or FMD for short. Inflammation can be checked with blood tests (blood tests that measure this irritation inside the body that you cannot feel). HIV medications can improve the artery lining health and can partially lower levels of inflammation in the blood; however these levels of inflammation may not be able to return back to normal. Pravastatin sodium is a medication that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating high cholesterol. Pravastatin sodium has also been able to improve the health of the lining of the arteries and lower the level of inflammation in people with other diseases but has not been studied or approved for this purpose in people who have HIV. This research study will look at the effects of two types of medications used separately or together on the health of the lining of arteries and levels of inflammation in the blood: Atripla (a HIV medication) and pravastatin sodium. This study will also look at the effects of Atripla and pravastatin sodium on cholesterol levels tests that measure how well you can think and calculate (tests of neurocognitive function) and at the effects of Atripla on the levels of pravastatin sodium in the blood.    ,NCT01515813
HIV,Effects of Losartan and Antiretroviral Regimen Containing Raltegravir in Fibrosis Inflammation Mediators Cardiovascular Risk and Neurocognitive Disorders in HIV Infected Patients Previously Effectively Treated, This is a open controlled trial in which 48 HIV-1 patients successfully treated with EFV/FTC/TDF will be randomized to one of 4 groups in equal proportion between arms (1:1). The four arms are as follows: Arm I: EFV / FTC / TDF (n = 12) Arm II: EFV / FTC / TDF + LST (n = 12) Arm III: FTC / TDF + MK-0518 (n = 12) Arm IV: FTC / TDF + LST + MK-0518 (n = 12) The allocation will take place in two phases: Phase I: 24 patients 1:1 receiving EFV/FTC/TDF vs. EFV/FTC/TDF + Losartan If losartan arm shows benefits we will proceed to the second phase: Phase II: 24 patients 1:1 to receive FTC/TDF+ MK-0518 versus FTC/TDF + MK-0518 + losartan. Patients will be followed up during 12 months to determinate the proportion of patients with decreased collagen deposition in TL equal to or greater than 50%.    ,NCT01529749
HIV,Sevelamer for Reducing Endotoxemia and Immune Activation, HIV-infected people can have an increase in inflammation in their body organs even after taking anti-HIV medicines. Sevelamer carbonate is used to bind phosphate in dialysis patients. It can also bind endotoxin in the gut and lowers endotoxin levels in the blood of dialysis patients. Sevelamer carbonate decreases the inflammation endotoxin causes in dialysis patients. A5296 is a phase II single-arm study to evaluate the effect of 8 weeks of sevelamer carbonate administration on markers of microbial translocation and T-cell activation in the blood in chronically HIV-infected subjects not receiving ART.    ,NCT01543958
HIV,Phase I/IIa Dose-escalation Clinical Study of VAC-3S, The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the therapeutic vaccine candidate VAC-3S in HIV-1 infected patients under AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART) with undetectable viral loads.    ,NCT01549119
HIV,Immunotherapy With Vacc-C5 With Adjuvant GM-CSF or Alhydrogel in HIV-1-infected Subjects on ART, Background: Despite the introduction of highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimes which control the HIV infection and results in increases in CD4 cell counts and an undetectable viral load many patients suffer from increased morbidity. There is evidence that presence of antibodies against the C5 region of gp120 strongly correlates with slower disease progression and that loss of antibody responses to this region are associated with progression. Investigational product: Vacc-C5 is a single heterodimeric peptide-based HIV therapeutic vaccine corresponding to the C5 region on gp120 and the external domain of gp41. The vaccine is intended to create a non-neutralizing antibody against C5 region. Study objectives:   1. To evaluate safety of the vaccination regimens   2. To evaluate C5-specific humoral immune responses (antibodies) T cell responses T cell activation markers and other immune markers.    ,NCT01627678

HIV,Vacc-4x + Lenalidomide vs. Vacc-4x +Placebo in HIV-1-infected Subjects on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), During the course of HIV infection the number of CD4 cells decreases resulting in a reduced immunological response and ultimately immune deficiency. Vacc-4x is a peptide-based HIV immunotherapy and the primary objective is to strengthen the immune system's response to HIV p24. By adding Lenalidomide an immunomodulatory agent as a supporting drug it is anticipated that the effect of Vacc-4x might be enhanced.    ,NCT01704781
HIV,Re-boosting of HIV-1 Infected Subjects With Vacc-4x, During the course of HIV infection the number of CD4 cells decreases resulting in a reduced immunological response and eventually immune deficiency. Vacc-4x is a peptide-based HIV immunotherapy vaccine and is anticipated to strengthen the immune system's response to HIV. All patients participating in this trial have previously received the vacc-4x vaccine in order to reduce the amount of HIV-1 virus in the blood and increase the immune response. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if a re-boost with Vacc-4x could further reduce the amount of HIV-1 virus and increase the immune response.    ,NCT01712256

HIV,Nevirapine vs Ritonavir-boosted Lopinavir in ART Naive HIV-infected Adults in a Resource Limited Setting, In resource-limited setting concerns remain regarding the emergence of virologic failure and high-level drug resistance mutations (DRM) during WHO recommended first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) based regimens for Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV1) infected patients. The study hypothesis is that a boosted-protease inhibitor regimen has a better outcome than a NNRTI-based regimen with a low genetic barrier to resistance. The study is a randomized multicenter factorial trial (conducted in Congo) in treatment- naÃ¯ve adults receiving for 96 weeks ritonavir- boosted lopinavir(LPV/r) or nevirapine (NVP) each in combination with tenofovir (TDF) /emtricitabine (FTC) or zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC). The primary end point is the incidence of therapeutic (clinical and/or virologic)failure by study week 24.    ,NCT01772940
HIV,FTC/RPV/TDF on T-Cell Activation CD4 Cell Count Inflammatory Biomarkers and Viral Reservoir, This study is being done with people who are infected with HIV but do not show any signs of having HIV. They are also feeling well without taking HIV medication and have low or undetectable levels of the virus in the blood. The purpose of this study is to see if taking HIV medication (antiretroviral therapy [ART]) will reduce immune activation (a signal that the body is fighting an infection) in people who have HIV but do not show symptoms. Also this study will help determine how safe the drug is and how well people react to the drug. For this study the following antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be provided in the form of a single tablet that contains three different drugs: emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF). These drugs are combined as one tablet which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a single pill to treat HIV infection. The HIV medication provided is one of the recommended treatments for HIV including people with low viral loads (how much HIV you have in your body) who are taking HIV drugs for the first time. The risks seen with this HIV medication are the same that one would encounter when taking these drugs outside of the study.    ,NCT01777997
HIV,Rosuvastatin to Decrease Residual Immune Activation in HIV Infection, Participating countries: France Objectives Principal objective To evaluate in HIV-1 infected patients receiving effective antiretroviral therapy the effect of the addition of Rosuvastatin (dose of 20mg/day) for 3 months on CD8 T cell activation as assessed by the proportion of peripheral CD8 T cells that co-express the activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR Secondary objectives To evaluate the effect of Rosuvastatin administration on residual CD4 and CD8 T cell activation To evaluate the effect of Rosuvastatin administration on the main serum soluble biomarkers of activation (CRP- HS D-dimers IL-6 and soluble CD14) To evaluate the effect of Rosuvastatin administration on CD4 T-cell count and on the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio To study the relationship between the level of immune activation and the level of residual HIV replication in plasma To study the effect of Rosuvastatin administration on lipid profiles and the correlation between the HDL cholesterol and the CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio To evaluate the tolerance of Rosuvastatin at the dose of 20 mg/day    ,NCT01874743
HIV,Evaluating Pharmacokinetic Interactions With Vaginal Ring Contraceptives and ART, This study will look at a method of hormonal birth control called the NuvaRing and specific anti-HIV medications called antiretrovirals (ARVs). Some studies of women who use a hormonal birth control method (specifically oral pills patches and injections) and take ARVs have shown that ARVs interact with the hormones released by the birth control medication. These interactions may cause the birth control to be less effective at preventing pregnancy. There is also concern that hormonal birth control can increase HIV spreading to others but more studies are needed to determine if this is true. The investigators do not know whether the NuvaRing and ARVs interact when they are used together so this study will look to see if certain ARVs (efavirenz and atazanavir/ritonavir) interact with the two hormones released by NuvaRing. This will help us to determine if NuvaRing is safe and effective for women with HIV infection who are taking ARVs. The study will also include HIV-infected women who are not on ARVs but will use the NuvaRing to show us what the hormone levels are like in a similar group of women not on ARVs. Vaginal rings are also currently being studied to deliver anti-HIV medications that may prevent HIV acquisition and to provide birth control over a longer period of time (more than 1 month). Since vaginal rings will become more commonly used to administer medications the investigators want to better understand the potential for drug interactions with drugs given vaginally. This study will also help us understand the potential for drug interactions between ARVs given orally and other drugs given through vaginal rings like the NuvaRing. Additionally this study will help us understand how hormones released from a vaginal ring affect the amount of HIV virus in the genital tract the bacterial make-up (microbiome) of the female genital track and the immune system within the genital tract all of which may affect the chances of spreading HIV.    ,NCT01903031

HIV,Telmisartan to Reduce AIDS-Related Fibrotic and Inflammatory Contributors (TRAFIC Study), The main goal of this study is to see if a drug called telmisartan will decrease fibrosis (scarring) and inflammation (irritation) in people who are infected with HIV and doing well on their HIV medications. The study is also being done to see what effects telmisartan has on other signs of disease and inflammation in the body and to see whether people who have HIV can take telmisartan safely and without side effects that make them want to stop the drug. Telmisartan is FDA-approved for treating high blood pressure and decreasing the chance of heart attacks and strokes in people over the age of 55 years of age who are at high risk for these events.    ,NCT01928927
HIV,Pilot Peg-Interferon-a2b in Decreasing Viral DNA in HIV, We propose to test our primary hypothesis that treatment with Peg-IFN-Î±-2b will result in a decrease in integrated HIV DNA in peripheral blood and tissue in chronically HIV-infected immune-reconstituted individuals (see section 3.1) in a prospective interventional 1-arm open label clinical trial. To this end we propose to enroll 25 HIV-1-infected subjects (please refer to power calculations in section 10.1 below) currently stably suppressed (> 1y with VL < 50 copies/ml) on ART and with CD4 count > 450 cells/Âµl. We hypothesize that 20 weeks of treatment with Peg-IFN-alpha-2b in the presence of HIV reactivation (i.e.: ART interruption) will result in activation of intrinsic and/or immune-mediated anti-HIV mechanisms resulting in a decrease in the levels of viral reservoir in chronically HIV-infected immune-reconstituted individuals.    ,NCT01935089
HIV,VRC 601: A Phase I Open-Label Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a Human Monoclonal Antibody VRC HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) With Broad HIV-1 Neutralizing Activity Administered Intravenously or Subcutaneously to HIV-Infected..., This is the first clinical trial of the VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) monoclonal antibody. VRC01 is a broadly neutralizing antibody directed against HIV. This is a dose-escalation study to examine safety tolerability dose and pharmacokinetics of VRC01. The hypothesis is that VRC01 will be safe for administration to HIV-1 infected adults by the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) routes and will not elicit hypersensitivity reactions. Samples will be collected to learn if VRC01 is detectable in mucosal secretions and blood of participants and how long VRC01 can be detected in the blood after it is given. Between 15 and 25 HIV-1 infected adults ages 18-70 years will be enrolled. There are 4 dose escalation groups for IV administration; the doses are 1 mg/kg 5 mg/kg 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg. There is 1 group for SC administration at 5 mg/kg. Each group is expected to include at least 3 participants. Each participant will receive two infusions of VRC01 with about 1 month between doses. Infusions are administered in an inpatient unit and an overnight stay at the NIH Clinical Center is required. No more than one subject per day per group will receive a first infusion of the VRC01 product by the IV route and no more than one subject per week will receive a first infusion of the product by the SC route. Study participation lasts for 24 weeks. Participant health and effect on CD4 count and HIV viral load will be monitored. Samples will be collected and stored for research purposes.    ,NCT01950325
HIV,Multicentre Study To Assess Changes In Bone Mineral Density Of The Switch From Protease Inhibitors To Dolutegravir In HIV-1-Infected Subjects With Low Bone Mineral Density, Protease inhibitors (PI) have been associated with an acceleration of bone mineral density loss in HIV-infected individuals because of an enhanced osteoclast activity although some controversial data have been also published. A first study suggest an increase of bone mineral density after switching from PI to raltegravir the first generation integrase inhibitor but there are no more data about this subject. Based on data that PI decrease bone mineral density by accelerating osteoclast cells and that the discontinuation of this drugs could improve bone mineralization we propose a randomized prospective multicenter study to assess the impact of switching from PI to dolutegravir on bone mineral density in patients with low bone mineral density receiving a PI-containing regimen. At the same time the study will help to assess the antiviral efficacy and safety of a PI-sparing regimen including dolutegravir as a simplification strategy in virologically suppressed patients.    ,NCT01966822

The plasma samples will be tested in a method comparison study to support the approval of the Aptima HIV-1 assay on Gen-Probe's Panther testing system. The objective of the method comparison study is to evaluate the clinical utility of the Aptima HIV-1 assay by comparing the results to the FDA-licensed COBAS assay (Roche Molecular Systems Inc. Branchburg New Jersey) in plasma samples that have viral loads across the dynamic range of the Aptima HIV-1 assay.    ,NCT02026752
HIV,Systematic Empirical vs. Test-guided Anti-TB Treatment Impact in Severely Immunosuppressed HIV-infected Adults Initiating ART With CD4 Cell Counts <100/mm3, In countries with a high tuberculosis (TB) prevalence TB and invasive bacterial infections are leading causes of early death in patients who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) with advanced immunodeficiency. We hypothesize that a systematic 6-month empirical TB treatment initiated 2 weeks before the introduction of ART in HIV-infected adults with severe immunosuppression (CD4<100/mm3) and no overt evidence of TB will reduce the risk of death and invasive bacterial infections. This strategy will be compared to one of extensive TB testing using point-of-care tests (Xpert MTB/RIFÂ® and urine lipoarabinomanan LAM) and chest X-ray to identify and treat only patients with at least one positive test suggestive of TB.    ,NCT02057796
HIV,Multicentric Open-label Study of Switch From Abacavir/Lamivudine Fixed Dose Combination Plus Nevirapine to Abacavir/Lamivudine/Dolutegravir in Virologically Suppressed HIV-1 Infected Adults (SWAD), Abacavir/Lamivudine + Nevirapine (ABC/3TC + NVP) is a very effective and well tolerable regimen on the long-term. However this regimen comprises 2 pills per day. Abacavir/Lamivudine/Dolutegravir (ABC/3TC/DTG) offers simplification with a single pill per day with no food constraints Dolutegravir (DTG) having the advantage over Nevirapine (NVP) of high potency higher genetic barrier to resistance with a very good safety profile. The objective of this study is to evaluate the virologic safety (maintenance of virologic suppression) after switching from ABC/3TC + NVP to ABC/3TC/DTG in 50 HIV-1 infected adults with prolonged HIV RNA suppression on ABC/3TC + NVP as well as clinical and laboratory safety. Because nevirapine is a strong inducer of hepatic enzymes pharmacocinetic (PK) assessment will be performed in all patients in the first weeks after switch and 24-hours PK in a subset of 10 patients after 5 days of DTG addition to current regimen before switching to ABC/3TC/DTG.    ,NCT02067767

This study will consist of a 96 week double-blind treatment period. After Week 96 all participants will continue on blinded study drug treatment and attend visits every 12 weeks until treatment assignments are unblinded. All participants will return for an unblinding visit and will be given the option to receive open-label F/TAF and attend visits every 12 weeks until F/TAF is commercially available or the sponsor terminates the F/TAF clinical development program.    ,NCT02121795
HIV,Sofosbuvir-Containing Regimens Without Interferon For Treatment of Acute Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection, People who are recently infected with HCV have a great chance of being cured of the infection when they are treated with a combination of two drugs within the first 6 months of being infected. This study is being done to see if a combination of two new drugs in one pill can replace the old drugs to provide a safer more effective and better tolerated treatment for new HCV infection. The names of the new drugs are ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) and they will replace pegylated-interferon alfa (PEG-IFN a drug given as a weekly injection under the skin). The fixed-dose combination of LDV and SOF (LDV/SOF) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study started with participants in Group 1 receiving SOF in combination with RBV a drug also approved by the FDA for 12 weeks. There were a total of 17 participants in Group 1 and all completed treatment. All participants were monitored for safety and viral response while on treatment. After completing treatment all participants were evaluated for a treatment response after the end of treatment. If the treatment response in Group 1 was high enough the study design allowed for the possibility to decrease the length of therapy for Group 2 to 8 weeks using the same treatment. However this did not occur. Combined with the fact that a new and more effective treatment for chronic HCV has been approved since the study started Group 2 will now receive 8 weeks of LDV/SOF instead of 12 or 8 weeks of SOF with RBV.    ,NCT02128217
HIV,Modulation of Immune Activation by Aspirin, Since people started taking HIV medications illness from AIDS has decreased but other serious diseases like heart disease cancer and kidney and liver disease have increased. HIV causes inflammation (irritation) inside the body that cannot be felt but can be measured by blood. Inflammation can lead to diseases that have become some of the leading causes of death in people with HIV. HIV therapy can partially lower levels of inflammation measured in blood however levels of inflammation in people who have HIV may remain high compared with people not infected with HIV. Aspirin is a drug that is commonly used for pain relief but is also approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for preventing heart attacks and stroke in those who are at increased risk for heart attack and stroke. Aspirin also is used (but is not approved by the FDA) to decrease the risk of some cancers in people who are at increased risk. Aspirin is thought to decrease risk of heart attack and stroke because it blocks the activation of platelets and prevents blood clots from clogging narrowed blood vessels a disease called atherosclerosis. It is unknown how aspirin might decrease the chance of developing cancer in some people at higher risk but aspirin has been shown to modulate (or change) the immune system. In HIV-infected people who have been taking antiretroviral therapy and have an undetectable HIV viral load it was recently shown that low-dose aspirin 81 mg (baby aspirin) given for one week lowers platelet activation and reduces blood markers of inflammation which may improve the function of the immune system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether aspirin improves inflammation and immune activation when compared to a placebo (inactive medication like a dummy pill) and to determine if 12 weeks of aspirin 300 mg and aspirin 100 mg is safe for HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy. Additionally it studied whether a higher dose and longer duration of aspirin provides further anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating benefit. This was done using blood and urine tests that measure inflammation and also with a test that uses ultrasound to measure the flow of blood in your arm called flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery (BART). This is a painless test that bounces sound waves off of a blood vessel in your arm.    ,NCT02155985

HIV,Capacity of the Dual Combination Raltegravir/Etravirine to Maintain Virological Success in HIV-1 Infected Patients of at Least 45 Years of Age- ANRS 163 ETRAL, This multicenter international non randomized (single arm) open phase II trial aims to evaluate the capacity of the dual combination raltegravir/etravirine to maintain virological success in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected patients of at least 45 years of age switching from a boosted PI-containing regimen. Patients will be followed for 96 weeks. Measurement of primary endpoint will be at 48 weeks. Virological success is defined as the absence of 2 consecutive plasma viral load >50 copies/mL within 2 to 4 weeks of a dual raltegravir/etravirin regimen. Raltegravir/etravirine will be considered acceptable if the percentage of patients in virological success at week 48 is significantly above 90 %. Assuming a 95 % virological success rate by including 160 individuals and considering the strategy to be acceptable if no more than 8 individuals have virological failure; investigators will have a 95 % probability to discard a combination for which efficacy is smaller than 90 % and investigators will select with a power of 80 % the strategy for which the efficacy is above or equal to 95 %. The principal secondary endpoint is the proportion of patients in therapeutic success up to week 48 and 96.    ,NCT02212379

HIV,Progesterone Supplementation for HIV-positive Pregnant Women on Anti-Retrovirals, In pregnancy cART is considered optimal for maternal health and for preventing the emergence of resistance that could compromise further care. In Canada the majority of HIV-positive pregnant women receive a PI-based cART regimen. In the past therapy was generally deferred until after the first trimester (if not required for maternal health) to minimize any unknown risk of teratogenicity. However as treatment is now started earlier in HIV infection and as perinatal transmission rates are lowest in those with prolonged suppression of viral load during pregnancy women are increasingly commencing cART either before conception or earlier in pregnancy. Multiple reports and cohort studies provided data suggesting an association between PI-based cART use and preterm birth low birth weight and small for gestational age (SGA) babies although conflicting data exist. In the general population progesterone supplementation is widely used is well tolerated is considered safe and is beneficial to prevent recurrent pre-term birth and increase birth weight. The investigators experimental findings suggest that PI use during pregnancy is associated with declines in progesterone levels that correlate with fetal growth and that progesterone supplementation can improve PI-induced fetal growth restriction. The investigators preliminary findings in HIV+ pregnant women suggest that PI-use is associated with declines in progesterone levels which correlate with birth weight percentile. Since HIV-positive women have higher rates of pre-term delivery and low birth weight that may be magnified by the use of PIs then progesterone supplementation could be of benefit to neonatal health in the context of HIV-positive pregnancy.    ,NCT02400021

HIV,Probiotic Visbiome for Inflammation and Translocation in HIV II," Modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed the clinical care and lived experience of HIV infection. However increased rates of adverse health conditions that are related to immune activation such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurodegenerative disease in ART-treated individuals persist. An important cause of this inflammation is the gut CD4 T cell loss and the ""leaking"" or translocation of luminal gut bacteria and other microbes across the bowel wall and into the bloodstream. The use of complementary and alternative therapies is very common among people living with HIV with estimates ranging from 16-60%. However their efficacy has generally not been well demonstrated. Probiotics are live microbes that may provide a health benefit to the host and the investigators believe that the simultaneous use of probiotics along with ART will improve gut CD4 T cell restoration and function and therefore reduce microbial translocation and immune activation. A major challenge to HIV treatment is the suboptimal CD4 T cell count despite successful HIV suppression on ART in immunologic non-responders (INRs). These individuals are at increased risk of AIDS-related deaths and non-AIDS related comorbidities that may be associated with increased immune activation and microbial translocation from the gut mucosa. With limited treatment options alternative therapies to reduce inflammation and restore gut immunology will be important. Probiotic Visbiome consists of a high potency blend of eight different probiotics. The precise mechanism of action of Visbiome is unknownbut preclinical studies have shown that Visbiome may modulate the immune response towards an immunoregualtory phenotype with increased the levels of IL-10 and reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFÎ± IL1Î² and IL-8). Thereforethe investigators believe that the ""beneficial"" bacteria from Visbiome will accelerate the normalization of gut immune cells and function in HIV-infected INRs. It is hypothesized consumption of Visbiome for 48 weeks will help restore the immune system in INRs who have suboptimal immune reconstitution to currently available ART. Resolution of gut immune cells will mean that microbial translocation and immune activation will be normalized and will reduce the rates of HIV-associated comorbidities.    ",NCT02441231

HIV,Study Evaluating the Efficacy of a Reduced Dose Atazanavir in HIV-1-infected Patients," The goal of antiretroviral therapy should be maintaining undetectable plasma viral load only present condition to prevent the progression of the disease improve immune restoration and prevent the emergence of viral resistance mutations. In addition to the individual benefit antiretroviral treatment reduces the transmission of HIV from an infected person to sexual partners. There is to date no alternative strategy to antiretroviral treatment and antiretroviral therapy even extended does not allow viral eradication. The need to maintain antiretroviral therapy for life raises the long-term safety concerns of it even with the latest molecules. Also one of the key issues in clinical research is whether after reaching undetectable viral load antiretroviral treatment can be reduced in order to reduce exposure to molecules. Indeed this treatment of ""maintenance"" could potentially need a smaller antiviral potency. On the other hand reduction of antiretroviral treatment reduces costs an important consideration in light of new global recommendations of treatment for all patients with T-cells CD4 below 500 / mm3. The alleviation of antiretroviral therapy is to either reduce the number of molecules by making monotherapies or dual therapy or to realize or intermittent treatment is to reduce the doses of molecules such as randomized ENCORE -1 showing the equivalence of a dose of Efavirenz 400mg instead of 600mg in naive patients. Atalow study has the sense to lower the dose of Atazanavir / Ritonavir in combination with two NRTI to reduce exposure to this molecule and its cost while maintaining an undetectable viral load.

HIV,Pharmacokinetics of Atazanavir /Dolutegravir/Lamivudine Regimen as Maintenance Regimen, During the past years the treatment of HIV-1 infection has transformed towards chronic treatment. Patients are being treated with antiretroviral drugs for many years and become older. The risk of developing side-effects due to long term antiretroviral therapy is therefore more and more likely. New alternative once-daily maintenance regimes are needed for those who are extensively pre-treated and experience side-effects or toxicity on standard treatment combinations. A possible once-daily fully active maintenance regimen is the combination of atazanavir (unboosted) dolutegravir and lamivudine (PRADAII regimen). This combination is expected to be a safe once-daily maintenance regimen with a favorable side-effect profile. The combination suits patients with intolerance and/or resistance to NRTIs NNRTIs and ritonavir who have a suppressed viral load. However for this new combination the pharmacokinetic profile is unknown and there are no data on short-term and long-term safety and efficacy. This study wille therefore asses the pharmacokinetics safety and efficacy in a small number of HIV-1 infected patients.    ,NCT02566707
HIV,Targeting Platelets in Chronic HIV Infection, Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have resulted in increased survival of the HIV-infected population; however this gain in longevity is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although ART and traditional risk factors contribute to CVD in this population heightened markers of immune activation inflammation and coagulation independently predict morbidity and mortality suggesting that dysregulation of these systems plays a significant role in the increased risk of CVD. The investigators believe that platelet activation is an important driver in HIV-associated immune activation inflammation and coagulation leading to an increased CVD pathophysiology and risk. Platelets initiate thrombus formation and also play a key role in vascular inflammation by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators and cross-talking with other relevant cell types including leukocytes. Researchers have described platelet hyperreactivity in chronic HIV infection. Importantly the investigators demonstrated that one week of anti-platelet therapy (aspirin) decreased platelet activation and immune activation with an improved trend in inflammation and immune parameters. The overall hypothesis is that platelet activation is a major driver of immune activation inflammation and thrombosis in ART-treated HIV infected patients. The purpose of the proposed proof-of-concept study is to understand the mechanism(s) by which anti-platelet therapy improves immune and inflammatory parameters in chronic HIV infection. To test this the immune modulating and anti-inflammatory effects of 24 weeks of the anti-platelet drug aspirin as compared to the anti-platelet drug clopidogrel will be evaluated. Given their different mechanisms of action and inhibitory potency the investigators can differentiate whether the potential benefits are mediated via inhibition of arachidonic acid (aspirin) or inhibition of ADP (clopidogrel) or by the antithrombotic activity.

HIV,Dolutegravir Plus Lamivudine Dual Therapy in Treatment NaÃ¯ve HIV-1 Patients, This study is being done to see if the combination of two anti-HIV medicines dolutegravir (DTG Tivicay) and lamivudine (3TC Epivir) taken once a day will provide a safe effective and well-tolerated treatment for HIV. DTG is a type of HIV medicine called an integrase inhibitor; 3TC is a type of HIV medicine called a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. DTG works by blocking integrase and 3TC works by blocking reverse transcriptase two HIV proteins (enzymes). This prevents HIV from multiplying and lowers the viral load (amount of HIV in the blood). Both DTG and 3TC are currently part of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended regimens along with a third active drug. Since some HIV medicines have side effects and are costly there is interest in whether HIV can be successfully controlled with fewer than three HIV drugs.    ,NCT02582684

HIV,Efficacy and Safety of a Dolutegravir-based Regimen for the Initial Management of HIV Infected Adults in Resource-limited Settings, Several reports indicate that treatment failure due to HIV resistance or to adverse event-related discontinuation could compromise the effectiveness of scaling-up antiretroviral treatment (ART) especially when lack of access to viral load is a concern. Combined with other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor Dolutegravir (DTG) is a very promising alternative to the current first-line non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens. Initial evaluations of DTG conducted in high income countries showed excellent efficacy and safety and indicated high genetic barrier thus preserving second line treatment. As a consequence DTG-based regimens have been recently included in the first-line options in the national guidelines for ART of several high-income countries. However the clinical trials evaluating DTG-based regimens have been conducted in highly controlled conditions including baseline resistance testing and regular viral load monitoring. Moreover these trials included a high proportion of men with rare co-morbidities. There is need to evaluate how a DTG-based regimen will perform in real-world conditions within resources-constrained settings where viral load monitoring is limited and where the majority of HIV patients are women with important family planning consideration and NAMSAL trial is a randomized clinical trial which aims to evaluate efficacy and safety over 48 weeks of DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine versus Efavirenz (EFV) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine in 606 ART-naÃ¯ve HIV-1-infected adults in Cameroon.

HIV,PREPARE (A5361s) Substudy of REPRIEVE (A5332), Aging with HIV may be related to an earlier development of frailty (weakness) or disability including difficulties in tests of strength or walking speed. Few treatments have been shown to prevent or slow these impairments in people with or without HIV. Some studies have suggested that the class of drugs called statins (for example pitavastatin) might be helpful in slowing frailty or disability. This might happen by decreasing fat within the muscle or by decreasing inflammation markers (substances in the blood that determine how the body reacts to infection or irritation) in the blood. Other studies have shown that statins increase the risk of muscle aches and pains. This substudy is being done to determine the impact of the drug pitavastatin on muscle.    ,NCT03070223

HIV,Multicountry Multicenter Post-Marketing Observational Study of Clinical Biological and Virological Outcomes Compliance and Tolerability of KaletraÂ® in Routine Clinical Use, KaleEAST is a non-interventional post-marketing observational study (PMOS) in which lopinavir/ritonavir is prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with regards to dose population and indication. No additional procedures (other than the standard of care) are to be applied to the patients. The KaleEAST PMOS was conducted in a prospective single-arm multicountry multicenter format. The study was carried out in two (2) parts: the first part was initiated in 2004 with the lopinavir/ritonavir capsule formulation the second part started in 2006 after the lopinavir/ritonavir tablets had become available in the participating countries. The aim of this post-marketing observational study was to obtain further data on clinical biological and virological outcomes compliance and tolerability of KaletraÂ®-containing regimen during routine clinical use in the participating countries.    ,NCT01379703

HIV,Impact of Cotrimoxazole Use in Immunocompetent HIV Patients on Carriage of Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria, Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) is recommended for prevention of morbidity and mortality due to Pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections in HIV positive patients with low immunity. Common clinical practice is to start CPT in any patient with CD4 counts below 200/ÂµL and conversely to stop CPT when immunity has been restored by antiretroviral treatment to CD4 counts above 200/ÂµL or when viral suppression has been documented for 3 months. However the latest WHO guidelines widely expands the indication for CPT by advocating for settings with high prevalence of malaria and bacterial infections that all patients with HIV start CPT regardless of CD4 counts and clinical stage. Furthermore WHO recommends these patients to continue CPT indefinitely regardless of evidence of immune restoration (The recommendation is for settings with high prevalence of malaria and bacterial infections not for high-income countries). There is limited scientific evidence to recommend prolonged CPT as studies have shown it is associated with modestly reduced morbidity due to pneumonia meningitis and malaria but no corresponding reduction in mortality. The impact of such a large increase in antibiotic use on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has not been thoroughly considered. Our previous studies in Tanzania showed that multidrug-resistant bacteria frequently cause bloodstream infections with resultant very high case-fatality rates. As genes encoding for multiple antibiotic resistance traits are transferred by plasmids together with resistance towards cotrimoxazole prolonged CPT will likely favor the selection of carriage of multidrug-resistant gut bacteria. The proposed randomized clinical trial is designed to assess whether prolonged CPT in HIV-positive patients results in increased fecal carriage of multi-drug resistant gut microbes or increased nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Secondary endpoints are morbidity (clinical events hospitalizations) and mortality. Stool specimens nasal swabs and clinical data will be collected from persons attending voluntary counseling and testing facilities and HIV-clinics in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. The study results may have important impact on public health in terms of assisting development of rational recommendations for CPT use and may help prevent emerging antibiotic resistance.    ,NCT03087890
HIV,INTERVAL: Varying Intervals of ART to Improve Outcomes in HIV, This is an unblinded cluster-randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of two strategies for scripting/dispensing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on retention virologic suppression and cost compared to the standard of care. The study will be conducted in Malawi and Zambia among approximately 8200 HIV-1-infected adults (18 years or older) who are stable on ART. Clusters will be randomized to one of three study arms: (1) standard of care (SOC) ART scripting (varies by country region clinic and/or provider) (2) three-month ART scripting and (3) six-month ART scripting. 30 clusters will be selected for the study 15 in Malawi and 15 in Zambia and will be randomized to a study arm.    ,NCT03101592

HIV,Trial Evaluating a First Line Combination Therapy With Raltegravir Emtricitabine and Tenofovir in HIV-2 Infected Patients, The HIV-2 is less common ie 1-2 million people in West Africa. HIV-2 does have the same sensibility to antiretroviral treatment (ART) compared to HIV-1. The ART strategies that are appropriate for the HIV-1 infection are not as effective for HIV-2. Classical triple therapy including PI is less effective for HIV-2. Also the choice of ARTs in a second line treatment is limited. The first line optimal treatment has to be defined by a prospective and randomized evaluation of other strategies. The primary endpoint will be adapted to the specificity of the HIV-2 infection. The 1st step is to define with a phase II clinical trial whether a strategy including 2 NRTIs and raltegravir as an alternative strategy to the classical triple therapy shows an immunovirological response at least as good as the one obtained with the triple therapy. The hypothesis is that the low ART response observed in HIV-2 infection is due to a low virological strength of the ARTs used and that the combination of 2 NRTIs and raltegravir should show a therapeutic success of at least 50% at week 48.    ,NCT01605890
HIV,First-Line Treatment for HIV-2," FIT-2 is a multi-country phase IIb randomized non-comparative study carried out in West Africa (CÃ´te d'Ivoire Burkina Faso Senegal Togo Guinea). ARV-naÃ¯ve HIV-2 infected adult patients will be recruited and followed during 96 weeks.

HIV,An Open Label Trial of Stribild for Antiretroviral (ARV)-naÃ¯ve HIV-2 Infected Adults in Dakar Senegal, There is a critical need for safe and effective antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens for HIV-2 infection. This is especially true in West Africa where the vast majority of the 1-2 million individuals infected with HIV-2 live and were access to effective ART for HIV-2 is limited. HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (T-20) and mutations conferring broad resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are frequently observed in HIV-2 from patients receiving ART. Although antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PI) can be used effectively to treat HIV- 2 HIV-1 and HIV-2 also exhibit important differences in their susceptibilities with studies indicating that saquinavir (SQV) lopinavir (LPV) and darunavir (DRV) are the only potent PI's against HIV-2 replication and cross-resistance is frequent. Although an increasing body of evidence supports the potential utility of integrase inhibitors (INI) against HIV-2 there have been no clinical trials to assess their effectiveness and they are not routinely available in resource-limited settings. These limitations present major challenges to HIV-2 treatment particularly in the areas in which it is most prevalent. This study is the 1st use of STRIBILD (elvitegravir (EVG) cobicistat (COBI) emtricitabine (FTC) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)) an INI-based single tablet regimen in HIV-2 infected adults in West Africa. The investigators hypothesize STRIBILD will be safe and effective as ART for HIV-2 infection. The Specific Aims of this study are: AIM 1: A pilot open label 48 week trial of STRIBILD (elvitegravir cobicistat emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in 30 ARV-naÃ¯ve HIV-2 Infected Adults in Dakar Senegal. AIM 2: Determination of genotypic and phenotypic HIV-2 antiretroviral resistance in individuals with virologic failure (HIV-2 plasma RNA >250 copies/ml) participating in the 48 week trial of STRIBILD    ,NCT02180438

HIV,Mild Neurocognitive Disorder in HIV Infection of the Brain, Background: - Some people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) develop problems with thinking and concentration when the virus affects the brain. This is known as mild neurocognitive disorder (MND). Research has shown that some HIV medications do not get through the blood brain barrier very well. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a brain protein that is part of the blood brain barrier. Differences in the activity of P-gp may help explain why some people with HIV develop MND. It is also possible that MND is partly due to inflammation in the brain. Researchers want to study P-gp and its effect on MND and HIV infection. Objectives: - To study P-gp and brain inflammation related to HIV infection. Eligibility:   -  Individuals between 18 and 60 years of age who have HIV and either do or do not have MND.   -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine samples will be collected.   -  Participants will have one outpatient visit and one 3-day inpatient stay.   -  At the outpatient visit participants will provide blood samples and have a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). The spinal tap will collect cerebrospinal fluid for study.   -  At the inpatient visit participants will have two positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brain. These scans will study brain activity and possible inflammation. One scan will involve a study drug called tariquidar which blocks the activity of P-gp. A second lumbar puncture will be done before the first PET scan. Blood and urine samples will be collected daily.    ,NCT01547754
HIV,Vitamin D Supplements for HIV-positive Patients on cART, The ability of vitamin D to modulate the immune system and strengthen bones may mitigate the adverse medication consequences of HIV/AIDS but little is known about either the health benefits of vitamin D supplements or about the optimal dosing regimen for patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This trial is a comparison of two regimens for administering vitamin D and calcium to HIV-positive individuals taking antiviral medications. This study will help physicians make evidence-based decisions about the most effective way to use vitamin D in their patients and enable the design of large multi-center trials in the future.    ,NCT01295034

HIV,Evaluation of Albuminuria HIV-Infected Patients, This study will examine the following: 1) how common albuminuria and proteinuria are among HIV-positive patients 2) what causes albuminuria or proteinuria in these patients and 3) whether the condition becomes more severe over time. HIV-infected people are more likely than others to develop kidney disease. The earliest indicator of the possible presence of kidney disease is albuminuria (increased amounts of the protein albumin in the urine). A later indicator is the appearance of other proteins a condition called proteinuria. HIV-infected patients 8 years of age and older who do not have diabetes chronic kidney disease or cancer may be eligible for this study. Participants provide a urine sample during three visits as follows: the first upon enrollment in the study a second 3 months later and a third about 6 months after that. Blood samples are drawn at the first and last visits. At the first visit a medical history is taken and blood pressure height weight waist circumference hip circumference and upper arm skin thickness are measured. Participants who are found to have albuminuria or proteinuria are asked to undergo a kidney biopsy for research purposes. The procedure is optional. Participants who develop heavy proteinuria may be recommended to undergo a kidney biopsy in order to determine the nature of the kidney disease and begin treatment. The biopsy requires a 2-day hospital stay. For the procedure an anesthetic is given to numb the skin and a needle is inserted and guided into the kidney to withdraw a small tissue sample. The needle is passed twice and possibly three times. Following the procedure the subject remains in bed rest for at least 10 hours to minimize the risk of excessive bleeding....    ,NCT00524992
HIV,Prospective Study on HIV-related Hodgkin Lymphoma, Standard therapy for HIV-related Hodgkin lymphoma (HIV-HL) has not been defined. This trial was initiated to investigate a risk adapted treatment strategy in patients (pts) with HIV-HL as established in HIV-negative patients with HL. Treatment schedule:   -  Early stage favorable Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL): 2 cycles of doxorubicin bleomycin vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) plus 30 Gy involved field (IF) radiation   -  Early stage unfavorable HL: 4 cycles of bleomycin etoposide doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine procarbazine and prednisone (BEACOPP)-baseline or 4 cycles of ABVD plus 30 Gy IF radiation   -  Advanced HL: 8 cycles of BEACOPP-baseline. BEACOPP should be replaced by ABVD in pts with far advanced HIV-infection. After the completion of chemotherapy sites of initial bulky disease (those at least 5 cm in diameter) and residual tumor larger than 2.5 cm in diameter receive 30 Gy of irradiation.   -  Primary outcome measure: tolerability treatment-related mortality   -  Secondary outcome measure: complete remission rate progression-free survival (PFS) overall survival (OS).    ,NCT01468740
HIV,Effect of DHA on Lipid and Carbohydrate Metabolism Alterations and Body Fat Distribution in HIV Patients Under HAART., Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is able to cause lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis alterations which are associated to the redistribution of body fat. Alterations in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism contribute to the development of a highly atherogenic profile which together with altered fibrinolysis markers and increased presence of proinflammatory cytokines in blood (especially tumor necrosis factor alpha) that comes associated to the success of HAART can cause the development of accelerated atherosclerosis. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that has demonstrated its ability to reduce triglyceride levels; modify cholesterol fractions and increase the size of LDL particles thereby configuring less atherogenic plasma profile. Additionally administration of DHA has shown antiinflammatory and hypotensive activity which contributes to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications in these patients. At a molecular level DHA acts as a stimulator of the nuclear receptor PPAR-gamma which has been described to induce an increase in adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore the anti-inflammatory effects induced by DHA can decrease the elevated levels of TNF-alpha which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of body fat redistribution in HIV infected patients undergoing HAART. Therefore the hypothesis of this project is that DHA will be able to produce lipid-lowering anti-inflammatory hypotensive and profibrinolytic effects which all together should improve atherogenic profile of patients with HIV-1 infection receiving HAART. In addition their proprieties as PPAR agonist can improve the redistribution of body fat present in many of these patients. The study of the activity of DHA on dendritic cells and monocytes should indicate the absence of immunosuppressive effect of DHA in the context of HIV-1 infection. In summary DHA is a natural product from the omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids the therapeutic properties of which have been described in recent years and has shown cardio-vascular and metabolic beneficial effects without recognized side effects. The highly purified DHA administration at high doses could be able to reverse at least partially lipid abnormalities associated with HAART and to exert a beneficial effect on fat redistribution in HIV-infected patients treated with HAART. To ensure non deleterious immunological treat in these sensitive poly-medicated patients substantial changes in the functionality of dendritic cells and monocytic will be studied.    ,NCT02005900

HIV,Study of Reyataz in HIV-infected Patients With Lipodystrophy Syndrome, The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects with abdominal fat accumulation on their highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) regimen have better changes in fat distribution after switching to atazanavir-ritonavir than those remaining on their current protease inhibitor boosted HAART regimen.    ,NCT00135356
HIV,Comparing a Nucleoside-Analogue-Sparing Regimen and a Protease-Inhibitor-Sparing Regimen in HIV Infected Patients, Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the long time survival of HIV infected individuals. However an increasing number of HIV-patients have developed metabolic and morphological alterations including peripheral lipoatrophy. There is limited knowledge about lipodystrophic adverse events in nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-sparing regimens. The hypothesis is that nucleoside analogues are responsible for development of lipoatrophy and patients receiving an NRTI-sparing regimen will have little risk of peripheral lipoatrophy. The researchers plan to perform a randomized study recruiting 100 antiretroviral naive patients that will be randomized to receive a nucleoside analogue sparing HAART regimen or a protease-inhibitor sparing regimen. The main endpoint is changes in peripheral fat mass as determined by dual energy X-ray absortiometry (DEXA)-scanning.    ,NCT00135460

HIV,Safety Tolerability and Efficacy of Asunaprevir and Daclatasvir in Subjects Coinfected With HIV-HCV, Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem with an estimated 180 million people infected worldwide. In the United States an estimated 4.1 million people are infected and HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading indication for liver transplantation. Within HIV/HCV co-infected patients liver disease due to Hepatitis C progresses even more rapidly. While combination of ribavirin (RBV) and pegylated interferon (PEG) in combination with boceprevir/telaprevir is the currently recommended therapy for chronic HCV infection and has superior cure rates compared to PEG+RBV alone in HCV monoinfected patients treatment is still associated with a high incidence of adverse events (AEs) discontinuations and poor cure rates in several populations. Within the HIV/HCV co-infected population treatment for HCV remains complicated given drug interactions between anti-retrovirals and HCV protease inhibitors in addition to the extensive side-effects due to PEG +RBV alone. Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of a combination of anti-virals which target HCV without interferon (IFN) can cure HCV without additional toxicities. These novel therapies that do not rely on an IFN backbone may additionally enhance cure rates in HIV/HCV co-infected a population which has historically been difficult to cure. This is an open label study to assess the safety tolerability and efficacy of asunaprevir (ASV) 100 mg BID and daclatasvir (DCV) 60 mg daily (selective HCV NS3 and NS5A inhibitors respectively) in 20 HIV/HCV co-infected treatment-na(SqrRoot) ve and treatment experienced HCV genotype 1b individuals. The findings from this study will aid in the understanding of antiviral and host responses and determinants of response to an IFN free regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.    ,NCT02124044
HIV,Analysis of Host Genetic Factors in the Occurrence of Anemia and on the Virological Response to a Peg-interferon/Ribavirin Therapy in HIV-HCV Co-infected Patients, The treatment of HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection has made significant progress over the past decade with the therapy combining pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) to ribavirin (RBV). The cure of HCV infection which consists to obtain a sustained virological response (SVR) (undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after end of treatment) is reached in more than 50% of patients infected with HCV. However this rate is much lower around 30 to 40% in HIV-HCV co-infected patients and sometimes can be less than 20% for patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Haemolytic anemia is a dose-limiting adverse effect which occurs frequently under RBV therapy. RBV-induced anemia represents the main cause of treatment discontinuation or dose reduction of RBV thus limiting the chances of achieving a SVR. RBV has a large inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability and a relationship between the occurrence of anemia and RBV concentration was clearly demonstrated. However other factors including genetic factors could be predictive of hematotoxicity and/or a better efficiency. In particular IL-28B polymorphism analysis in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 before starting antiviral therapy could predict the response to treatment (positive predictive value). The genetic polymorphism of inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) is also strongly associated to a protective effect towards the RBV-induced-anemia. But most of these data are issued from studies performed in a Japanese HCV mono-infected population treated with Peg-IFN-RBV therapy for which there is no other causal variant that the rs1127354. Only few studies are reported in the literature in caucasian HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Moreover data on RBV plasma exposure are very scarce in all these studies showing an impact of the ITPA polymorphism on the occurrence of anemia. In addition others polymorphisms of SCL29A1/A2 and SCL28A2/A3 coding for RBV transporters ENT (equilibrative nucleoside transporter) et CNT (concentrative nucleoside transporter) would be associated to either rapid virological response or anemia in HCV infected patients treated by Peg-IFN plus RBV. No study considering both polymorphisms of ITPA IL-28B SCL29A1/A2 and SCL28A2/A3 genes and RBV plasma exposure data has so far been conducted in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Thus it would be interesting in a first time to assess the impact of the ITPA polymorphism on both the RBV plasma exposure and the protective effect towards RBV-induced anemia in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. This study could be helpful to the literature for possible further RBV dose adjustments according to ITPA activity. Then it would be relevant to further complete these data by assessing other genetic polymorphisms as IL-28B SCL29A1/A2 and SCL28A2/A3 and thus evaluate the overall pharmacogenetic relationships towards RBV-induced anaemia and/or virological response to a Peg-IFN/RBV therapy.    ,NCT01964742

HIV,Physiologic Investigation of the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Axis in HIV, The purpose of this study is to see if individuals with HIV-infection particularly those with increased belly fat have abnormalities in the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis. Renin angiotensin and aldosterone are hormones that regulate salt and water balance in the body and they may also have effects on sugar metabolism and cardiovascular health. There is some evidence that individuals with HIV-associated abdominal fat accumulation may have increased aldosterone which may contribute to abnormalities in sugar metabolism and increased cardiovascular disease seen in HIV. The purpose of this study is the measure renin angiotensin and aldosterone activity as well as other hormonal axes in people with and without HIV infection and with and without increased belly fat. The investigators hypothesize that aldosterone will be increased in HIV-infected individuals compared to those without HIV-infection and that aldosterone will be further increased in HIV-infected individuals with increased abdominal fat compared to those without abdominal fat accumulation.    ,NCT01407237

HIV,Novel Measures and Theory of Pediatric Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence in Uganda, Current measures of adherence detect problems weeks to months after they occur. Because the HIV virus rapidly begins replicating and mutating in the absence of effective antiretroviral therapy treatment failure may develop before an intervention can be deployed. Real-time objective adherence monitoring could redirect efforts from a reactive response to the proactive prevention of treatment failure. Because adherence is so closely associated with viral suppression accurate adherence monitoring could also strategically limit viral monitoring only to those patients at a defined risk for viral rebound. This observational study is assessing a wireless adherence monitoring device and mobile phone-based adherence data collection among caregivers of children under the age of ten years in Mbarara Uganda. It involves both quantitative and qualitative measures of the feasibility and acceptability of these measures as well as circumstances of adherence lapses and other individual and cultural factors affecting adherence. The qualitative data will be used to explore models of adherence behavior which will likely include the child-caregiver dynamic the child's mental and physical health and social support mechanism.    ,NCT01140633

HIV,Leukapheresis to Obtain Plasma or Lymphocytes for Studies of HIV-infected Patients Including Long-term Non-progressors, This study will collect white blood cells and plasma for research on how the immune system controls HIV infection. The immune system of a very small group of HIV-infected patients called non-progressors has been able to control HIV for long periods without antiretroviral therapy. Some immune system-related genes important for this control have been identified in these patients. This study will examine the contribution of HLA genes B*57+ B*27+ and A*01+ to HIV disease in progressors and long-term non-progressors. (HLA type is a genetic marker of the immune system.) HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with HLA types B*57+ B*27+ and/or A*01+ may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo apheresis-a method for collecting larger quantities of certain blood components than can safely be collected through a simple blood draw-by one of the following two methods:   -  Automated pheresis - Blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein and spun in a machine separating the blood components. The white cells are extracted and the red cells with or without plasma (liquid part of the blood) are re-infused into the donor through the same needle or a needle in the other arm. An anticoagulant (medication to prevent blood from clotting) is usually added to the blood while in the machine to prevent it from clotting during processing.   -  Manual pheresis - One unit (1 pint) of blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein similar to donating a pint of whole blood. The red blood cells with or without plasma are separated from the rest of the blood and re-infused to the donor through the same needle. Manual pheresis will be done only when a person s estimated total blood volume or red cell count is too low to safely permit removal of blood through a pheresis machine. An adult small in size or markedly anemic for example may fall into this category. Some of the blood collected through apheresis may be stored for future studies of HIV disease and immune function and for HLA testing a genetic test of markers of the immune system. Some of the blood may be used to screen for different types of viral liver infections such as hepatitis A B C D E F or G.    ,NCT00029445

HIV,HIV Prevention in the Primary Care Setting, In the third decade of the HIV pandemic what was once a uniformly and rapidly fatal disease has been transformed into a chronic illness by advances in the understanding of HIV pathogenesis and therapeutics. As a result HIV-infected individuals are living longer and better lives. This phenomenon coupled with a continued steady rate of new HIV infections in this country has led to the highest U.S. HIV prevalence rates since the beginning of the epidemic. In the past HIV prevention efforts were separate from routine primary care delivery due to multiple factors including stigma and time constraints. Recent events including increases in sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates among HIV-infected persons and evidence that infected individuals can be super-infected by HIV strains resistant to antiretroviral therapy have inspired the SPNS program initiative to develop demonstration projects for interventions to reduce risky sexual exposures among HIV-infected patients receiving primary care.    ,NCT00381524

HIV,A Phase I Study of Quadrivalent Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) (Types 6 11 16 18) Recombinant Vaccine in HIV-Infected and HIV-Negative Pre-Adolescents Adolescents and Young Adults, Background:   -  Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted disease. There are more than 100 different HPV types and both males and females can get HPV infection. Most people do not have any symptoms when they become infected and are able to get rid of the infection on their own. However they can still become re-infected with the same or a different HPV type and in some people HPV infection persists.   -  Persistent HPV infection is associated with the development of precancerous lesions and cancer. HPV types are classified as either high risk or low risk based on whether their persistence will lead to cancer.   -  Patients who have suppressed immune systems are at a higher risk for HPV-related complications. They are more likely to contract multiple HPV types and have more persistent infection that can lead to precancerous lesions or cancer which are then difficult to treat and often recur.   -  A recently approved vaccine for HPV induces immunity to HPV 6 11 16 and 18. It was shown to be highly effective in preventing infection with these HPV types and is approved for use in females 9 to 26 years of age. However much less is known about the vaccine s ability to induce immunity in males or individuals with suppressed immune systems. Objectives: - To investigate whether the HPV vaccine is safe to give and able to induce immunity in both female and male adolescents and young adults with HIV infection compared to healthy HIV-negative persons of the same age. Eligibility: - Males and females 12 to 26 years of age divided into three groups: (1) Healthy and HIV-negative (2) HIV-positive and on antiretroviral therapy and (3) HIV-positive and not on antiretroviral therapy. Design:   -  Before beginning vaccination participants will have a complete physical examination and blood drawn for routine blood tests special tests of the immune system antibody tests and an HIV test.   -  HPV vaccine will be given by injection into the muscle at 0 2 and 6 months according to the standard vaccination schedule.   -  Patients with HIV infection will be monitored for a week following the first injection to test the level of HIV in the blood 3 days and 5 days after the first injection.   -  Participants will also be asked to fill out a 10- to 15-minute Web-based survey about awareness health behaviors and personal choices related to risk factors for HIV HPV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Participants are not required to fill out the survey to receive the vaccine.   -  The total duration of the study is 4 years. During the first year of the study participants will return for six additional 1-day visits at months 1 2 3 6 7 and 12. Participants will return for 1-day visits every 6 months for the remaining 3 years.    ,NCT00798265
HIV,Adjusting Antiretroviral Therapy Dosage Using Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, Background Low concentrations of protease inhibitors (PIs) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are associated with an increased risk of virological failure. Likewise excessive antiretroviral drug concentrations increase the risk of toxicity. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may identify and correct excessively high or low PI and/or NNRTI concentrations and thus minimize toxicity and risk of treatment failure. Treatment guidelines only recommend using TDM to help optimize ARV therapy in selected patients and there are no clear recommendations to guide the clinician who decides to adjust drug doses. Prospective studies have demonstrated the relationship between EFV plasma concentration and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Moreover EFV is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 2B6 and its concentration was reported to be associated with the CYP2B6 516GrT genetic polymorphism. For drugs such as EFV or LPV/r lower doses than the ones validated for standard clinical use have demonstrated efficacy in dose-ranging studies. The investigators will use a standardised algorithm to reduce doses in patients with plasma EFV or LPV/r concentration above percentile 75. This algorithm is based on a Bayesian approach from the pharmacology unit in Lausanne. The investigators hypothesize that a dosage individualisation is feasible and safe. 2.2 Study Aims The investigators aim at testing a simplified algorithm for dose reduction in patients with documented virological efficacy treated by a stable LPV/r or EFV based regimen with elevated plasma concentration of these drugs. Study Design Prospective open label study in which all eligible patients screened with a plasma drug concentration of either EFV or LPV/r above percentile 75 will be included. After confirmation of the results at baseline patients will be offered to decrease drug dosage by a third or a half according to a standardised algorithm. All patients will undergo HIVRNA biochemistry and validated questionnaires after 3 and 6 months to assess the safety and the benefit of this strategy.    ,NCT00836212

HIV,Comparison of Concentration-time Course of Plasma and Intracellular Raltegravir in Healthy Volunteers, The investigators hypothesize that the concentration-time profile of raltegravir is different in cells than that in plasma. Intracellular raltegravir concentrations may be higher and its half-life longer than in plasma. This may explain the efficacy of raltegravir despite variable plasma concentrations.    ,NCT01027182
HIV,Notification of Donors With Positive Microbiology Markers, Each year around 200 blood donors in the UK are found to be infected with blood-borne diseases (HIV hepatitis B hepatitis C and HTLV) while several others have been identified as having an increased risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). Although the notification procedures for these infections vary their effectiveness and appropriateness have never been evaluated in a systematic study. The proposed research has been designed to assess the responses of blood donors to notification and their satisfaction with how they were informed about the infection. The study will be implemented using standard questionnaire-based measures (French et al 2004; Marteau & Bekker 1992). The study will involve approximately 600 blood donors who were informed of an infection or possible infection with blood-borne diseases in 2008 and 2009 and approximately 100 donors notified of possible risk of vCJD infection in 2005. A comparable group of 2005 donors will be included to control for the effects of time. As the majority of donors testing positive donated to NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) the participants will be identified from the NHSBT database only and their availability confirmed through their GP or specialist clinician. A standardized questionnaire will be then sent to all those identified as eligible. The study will last 12 months but direct participant involvement will be limited to the time required to complete the questionnaire which should take under one hour. To safeguard confidentiality no identifiable personal data will be used in the analysis. Where demographic or medical information already held by NHSBT is retrieved to minimise response burden this will be pseudonymised before use. The study is sponsored by the blood services for England Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland. The results will be used to inform notification procedures in the future.    ,NCT01050881

HIV,Tenofovir Emtricitabine Efavirenz and Atazanavir Pharmacokinetics in the Aging HIV-Infected Population, Purpose: To see how growing older changes the amount of HIV drugs in the blood of HIV-infected men and women. Many changes happen in the body as it ages that may affect the way drugs are carried in the blood broken down or removed from the body. This study will look at the amount of drug in the blood and cells of the immune system for patients taking efavirenz tenofovir and emtricitabine or atazanavir boosted with ritonavir tenofovir and emtricitabine. Participants: The population will comprise of 56 (6 for intensive PK and 50 for sparse sampling) HIV-infected adults currently adhering to an antiretroviral regimen containing efavirenz with tenofovir and emtricitabine and the same number and distribution of HIV-infected adults currently adhering to an antiretroviral regimen containing atazanavir boosted with ritonavir with tenofovir and emtricitabine. Procedures (methods): This study will be completed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There will be four groups of subjects: Efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group A Efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group B Atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group A and Atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group B. The initial six subjects (Group A) for intensive PK analysis for each regimen will be recruited from the the UNC ID Clinic or the Moses Cone Health System Infectious Diseases Clinic and will be comprised of non-frail subjects not currently receiving interacting drugs. If subjects provide informed consent timed blood samples will be obtained to determine pharmacokinetic parameters around an observed dose of one of the two study regimens. A whole blood sample will also be collected and stored for potential drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters genotyping in the future. Group A subjects will complete a follow-up visit after their sampling visit. 50 subsequent subjects (Group B) for each regimen will be screened simultaneously with no more than 10 subjects enrolled for each regimen in Group B prior to the completion and analysis of Group A. These subjects will also be recruited from either site. Group B subjects will have one or two sampling visits with 1 to 4 blood samples obtained at each visit with a stored sample for future genotyping obtained on one of the visits. Samples will be collected just prior to a dose at 2 hours between 4 and 6 hrs and between 10 and 14 hours after a medication dose. These visits may coincide with the subjects' regularly scheduled visit to the clinic or be scheduled separately depending on the preference and availability of the subject.    ,NCT01180075
HIV,Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Immune Reconstitution in HIV-infected Patients, HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells that eventually leads to clinically significant immunodeficiency. A chronic generalized immune activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion loss of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. However it is still unknown whether reducing immune activation will restore CD4 T cell counts and leading to immune reconstitution in chronic HIV infection. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been demonstrated to decrease immune responses of the host and can suppress inflammation in HIV-infected non-responders. Here the investigators propose a hypothesis that MSC can reduce immune activation which subsequently lead to the restoration of CD4 T-cell counts dependent on dose of transfused MSCs in HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT01213186

HIV,Pharmacokinetic Study of Raltegravir in Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Hepatitis C Virus (HIV/VHC) Coinfected Patients With Advanced (Child-Pugh C) Hepatic Cirrhosis, Raltegravir is the first integrase inhibitor used in humans. It has been shown to be highly efficacious and well tolerated in phase III clinical trials in multidrug experienced human immunodeficiency virus(HIV)-infected patients as well as initial therapy in untreated patients. Pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adult subjects indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of the drug is glucuronidation mediated by UGT1A1 with a minor contribution of renal excretion of unchanged parent compound. Unlike CYP-based metabolism glucuronidation is generally found to be relatively unaffected by hepatic disease. A single dose pharmacokinetic study of raltegravir in patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency (Steigbigel et al. 2008) found no clinically important effect on the drug pharmacokinetic profile with no dosage adjustment being necessary. The liver safety and tolerability of boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) has been evaluated in human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus (HIV/HCV) coinfected patients with advanced liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis) (Hermida JM et al. 4th IAS: Sidney 2007). Similar to Raltegravir ATV is also mainly metabolized by conjugation through UGT1A1. There is an urgent need for potent and efficacious ARV drugs with a clean safety liver profile even in patients with severe liver disease. The investigators hypothesized that pharmacokinetics will not be altered in HIV/HCV patients with advanced (Child-Pugh grade C) cirrhosis or in those with no histologic liver damage.    ,NCT01289951

However it is still unknown whether reducing immune activation will restore CD4 T cell counts and leading to immune reconstitution in chronic HIV infection. Tripterygium Wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) has been demonstrated to decrease immune activation of the host and can suppress inflammation in human diseases. Here the investigators propose a hypothesis that TwHF can reduce immune over-activation which subsequently leads to the restoration of CD4 T-cell counts and immune reconstitution in HIV-infected immune non-responders.    ,NCT01666990
HIV,Body Image in Youth With HIV, This is an observational study that seeks to gather information about perceptions of body image through the use of a one-time questionnaire completed by participants at the time of study enrollment. Effective management of Human Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has become possible through the use of Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART). As a result of more successful treatment options HIV/AIDS has transitioned from a terminal illness to one which is treated as a chronic condition. One particular group that has been impacted tremendously by HIV in the United States is the adolescent population. As youth are living longer with HIV/AIDS clinicians and researchers are beginning to examine ways in which the disease can affect one's physical health mental health and other psychosocial factors. Research emerging involving adults with HIV/AIDS has suggested that increased attention to and negative views of one's body image may be found at a higher rate in this group. To our knowledge very few studies have examined this relationship in adolescents with HIV.    ,NCT01673750
HIV,Brain Imaging for HIV-Associated Thinking and Mood Disorders, Background: - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection appears to cause problems with blood vessel function. These problems may add to some thinking and mood disorders found in people with HIV infection. Researchers want to evaluate HIV infected patients to see if blood vessel function contributes to thinking and mood disorders such as early dementia and depression. To do so they will compare study results between people with and people without HIV infection. Objectives:   -  To compare the thickness of blood vessel walls between people with and without HIV infection.   -  To study the relationship between blood vessel thickness and thinking and mood disorders. Eligibility:   -  Individuals between 25 and 55 years of age who have HIV infection.   -  Healthy individuals between 25 and 55 years of age. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.   -  Participants will have imaging studies of the brain and major blood vessels in the head and neck.   -  Participants will also have neuropsychological testing. These tests will look at memory learning and thinking ability attention and mood.   -  Participants will have the option of coming back for repeat blood tests every six months and repeat imaging studies and neuropsychological tests every year over 1- 4 years period.    ,NCT01692236

HIV,DRV/r + RPV QD: Efficacy and Toxicity Reduction, Clinical approach to HIV infection treatment is based on the use of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) and recent national and international guidelines for guiding HIV therapy recommend the use of triple-combination therapy using antiretrovirals with 2 nucleos(t)ide inhibitors [N(n)RTI] as backbone plus a third drug to be chosen among a boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) a nonnucleoside inhibitor (NNRTI) or an integrase inhibitor (II). In spite of evident efficacy of HAART as demonstrated by survival increasing long term side effects as for example the impact on renal function remain principal problem. In patient with risk factor for renal disease a reduction of eGRF (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) between 90 and 60 mL/min/173 m2 could be already considered as a risk condition [12]. Efficacy of HAART with increase of media survival and the parallel decrease of mortality has underlined the necessity to reflect on long term HAART effects [3]. There are many evidences of HAART-related toxicity that in spite of the necessity of a life-saving therapy focus on the additional costs of this situation in terms of health as well as in terms of economic costs. Particular attention has been focused on the impact of some drugs on renal function as tenofovir especially on tubule without forgetting the modification of lipid and bone metabolisms. According to further studies which have evidenced the potential of some recently introduced molecules [45] the investigators had the need to realize a study to deepen the feasibility of a dual-therapy that permit to exclude NRTIs from the backbone with the aim to prevent NRTIs-related long-term toxicity. The investigators have designed a prospective randomized controlled trial open-label with a duration of 96 weeks to compare the efficacy of a dual-therapy based on rilpivirine 25mg plus darunavir 800mg/ritonavir 100mg QD in HIV-positive subjects with suppressed viremia from at least 3 months. In fact there are a few data about association of these drugs which it has been shown to be safe well tolerated and with a strong pharmacological synergy without nucleos(t)idic backbone while the necessity to minimize the costs toxicity-related is becoming increasingly compelling. According to clinical experience and literature data the investigators hope this study shows positive results in term of immune-virological efficacy as well as in term of decrease of VACS index - a complex parameter which has the purpose to quantify general organic decay - and markers of lipid and bone metabolism in group which receives dual-therapy versus the group with standard therapy.    ,NCT01792570

HIV,Efficacy Study of Different Laboratory Management Strategies and Drug Regimens in HIV-infected Children in Africa, The two original objectives were to determine in HIV-infected children initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART):   1. Whether clinically driven monitoring (CDM) will have a similar outcome in terms of disease progression or death as routine laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM) for toxicity (haematology/biochemistry) and efficacy (CD4)?   2. Whether induction with four drugs from two ART classes followed by maintenance with three drugs after 36 weeks be more effective than a continuous non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-based triple drug regimen in terms of CD4 and clinical outcome? Two secondary objectives were to determine   3. Whether changing from twice daily lamivudine+abacavir to once daily lamivudine+abacavir after 48 weeks on ART will have a similar outcome in terms of virological suppression and will result in improvements in adherence to ART?   4. Whether stopping daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in children over 3 years of age who have been on ART for at least 96 weeks has a similar outcome in terms of hospitalisation or death as continuing daily cotrimoxazole?    ,NCT02028676
HIV,Pediatric Urgent Start of Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART), Design: Randomized clinical trial involving hospitalized HIV-1 infected children. Children will be randomized to randomized to urgent (<48 hours) versus early antiretroviral therapy (7-14 days). This trial will be unblinded. Population: Hospitalized HIV-1 infected children who are antiretroviral therapy (ART) naÃ¯ve ??12 years of age. Sample size: 360 children will be randomized (180 per arm). Treatment: All infants will be treated with ART according to World Health Organization (WHO) and Kenyan national guidelines. Study duration: Enrollment into the study will occur over the course of 36-48 months and each infant will be routinely followed for a maximum of 6 months. Study site: Kenyan hospitals. Primary hypothesis: HIV-1 infected children hospitalized with severe co-infection either may be unsalvageable due to too far advanced immunosuppression/co-infection or may benefit from urgent ART. Secondary hypotheses: Urgent ART during an acute infection could potentially result in increased risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) or drug toxicities/interactions. Specific aims:   1. To compare the 6 month all-cause mortality rate incidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and incidence of drug toxicity in HIV-1 infected children (??12 years old) presenting to hospital with a serious infection randomized to urgent (<48 hours) versus early ART (7-14 days).   2. To determine co-factors for mortality IRIS and drug toxicity. Potential cofactors will include: baseline weight-for-age height-for-age weight-for-height (Z-scores) CD4 HIV-1 RNA type of co-infection age rate of viral load and CD4 change following ART immune activation markers pathogen and HIV-1 specific immune responses. Secondary aim: To determine etiologies of IRIS and to compare immune reconstitution to HIV TB EBV and CMV following ART overall and in each trial arm.    ,NCT02063880
HIV,DVD-based HIV/HCV Prevention Intervention for Drug-Involved Latino Criminal Justice Clients, The purpose of the study are the following: 1) Pilot test and conduct baseline and 3 month follow up assessments to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the DVD-based HIV/HCV intervention by randomly assigning 210 Latino corrections-involved outpatient abuse treatment clients to either the experimental intervention or to a wait list control group; and 2) to evaluate both participant and interventionist acceptability of this novel DVD-based intervention. They study hypothesis are the following:   1. participants in the intervention condition will report greater reductions in sexual risk behaviors (e.g. unprotected sexual contact) from baseline to 3 month follow-up compared to the control group;   2. participants will report greater reductions in drug risk behaviors (e.g. sharing injection equipment drug use during sex) from baseline to 3 month follow-up compared to the control group;   3. participants who report more HIV prevention information motivation and behavioral skills will report fewer sexual risk behaviors.    ,NCT02116179
HIV,Medication Adherence in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Although effective treatments are currently available to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) the retrovirus leading to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) strict adherence to the treatment regimen is required. Nonadherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens is well documented in individuals with HIV. This is especially true for adolescents and young adults (AYA) where rates of adherence range from 20 to 100%. Nonadherence has significant implications for subsequent treatment response and health outcomes including poor virologic response development of drug resistance and mortality. Of note previous research has suggested that every 1% increase in nonadherence is related to a 2% increased likelihood of detectable viral load (VL) in youth with behaviorally acquired HIV. Furthermore higher VL is the most salient variable related to increased risk of virus transmission. Thus nonadherence to HAART is a significant public health issue. The objective of the proposed research plan is to systematically examine an individualized behavioral intervention targeting HAART nonadherence in AYAs initiating HAART. The current intervention will support AYA participation in brief staff-delivered instruction in adherence-promotion skills. Individualized behavioral analysis and motivational interviewing will be applied to provide effective solutions for current barriers to HAART adherence before and after HAART initiation as recommended by the Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents.    ,NCT02119390
HIV,Improving Drug Adherence Among Adolescents in Uganda Using SMS Reminders, In this project the investigators develop and test a short message service (SMS) intervention based on the Information Motivation and Behavior skills (IMB) model. Reminding Adolescents To Adhere (RATA) prompts youths at two clinics in Uganda to take their medications and offers social support via weekly text messages. The investigators propose to adapt their previous successful SMS-intervention to the specific needs of youths and to evaluate the relative effectiveness of one-way versus two-way text messages (where two-way messages allow youths to respond to messages and we hypothesize that this may increase perceived social support that may be important for youth populations). We will also test the effectiveness of SMS messages over the longer-term (2 years) for which currently no information is available.    ,NCT02128087
HIV,Relationship of Tenofovir With HIV-1 Suppression in ex Vivo Tissue in Adolescents, Microbicides are topical medicines that can prevent infection by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Microbicide medicine has yet to be studied in adolescents a key group that is becoming infected with HIV all over the world. From past research we know that at different ages people experience age-related changes in their bodies that can cause differences in how they process medications. In this study gut tissue samples (or gut biopsies) from 12 HIV-negative volunteers will be collected. These pieces of tissue will be infected with HIV in the laboratory to develop a model that can be used to test certain drugs against the HIV infection. We can use this tissue to test a drug called tenofovir against HIV infection. We will determine whether this drug can decrease HIV infection in the gut biopsies. In this study we will also measure HIV levels and the levels of tenofovir in gut and blood samples in 12 people who are already taking this drug. This information can determine whether levels of drug found in the gut can protect it from HIV. The results can be compared to other age groups of adolescents and adults. Subjects will undergo a common procedure called a lower endoscopy (this can be a colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy) to obtain gut biopsy samples. The central hypothesis is that tissue drug profiles of tenofovir (TFV) and its active component tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tissue infectibility vary between younger (10-14 years old) versus older adolescents (18-21 years old) and that both differ from adults (>21 years). Specifically younger HIV positive adolescents will have lower levels of tissue tenofovir compared to older HIV positive adolescents and adults in an age-dependent manner. Additionally biopsies from younger HIV negative adolescents will have: 1) higher rates of infection compared to biopsies from older HIV negative adolescents infected with a lower dose of virus; and 2) lower percent suppression of tissue infectivity compared to biopsies from older HIV negative adolescents using low dose tenofovir.    ,NCT02134431

HIV,The Tolerability of and Adherence to Dolutegravir With Co-formulated Tenofovir-emtricitabine for HIV Non-occupational Post-exposure Prophylaxis, This study aims to describe the proportion of participants with non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (NPEP) failure defined as NPEP non-completion (including loss to follow-up) at week 4 or primary HIV infection at week 4 or 12 excluding those participants who should and do cease study drug because:   1. The participant is found to be HIV-infected (study drugs will be ceased until the genotype of the infecting strain is determined)   2. The source is found to be HIV-uninfected The primary study objectives are:   1. To describe on-drug adherence and regimen completion rates of 28 days of NPEP using dolutegravir (DTG) with co-formulated emtricitabine-tenofovir (FTC-TDF)   2. To describe the safety of 28 days of non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (NPEP) using dolutegravir with co-formulated emtricitabine-tenofovir The study is a multi-site prospective open-label non-randomized trial. One-hundred (100) eligible participants will receive dolutegravir (one tablet) with co-formulated emtricitabine-tenofovir two tablets once daily for 28 days based on one of the following exposures:   1. receptive anal intercourse with a source known to be HIV-infected; or   2. receptive anal intercourse with a source of unknown HIV status; or   3. insertive anal intercourse with a source known to be HIV-infected There will be 7 study visits over a 12-week period. Follow-up post NPEP is for 8 weeks i.e. to week-12 post-exposure. Any participant who is intolerant of dolutegravir will be managed at the investigator's discretion.    ,NCT02211690
HIV,Comparison of Virologic and Immunologic Responses to Raltegravir and Dolutegravir in the Gastrointestinal Tract of HIV-Positive Adults, This is a Phase IV open label observational study to compare the gastrointestinal tissue concentrations inflammatory response and viral replication of two integrase-inhibitors raltegravir and dolutegravir in HIV-infected volunteers who are virologically suppressed in blood plasma.

HIV,The Dolutegravir Antiretroviral Mono-Therapy for HIV Trial, 48-week open label randomized phase IV investigator initiated intervention study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether HIV-1 suppression can be maintained by DTG monotherapy in HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed patients on cART. 104 adults fulfilling the in and exclusion criteria and on stable cART will be randomized over 2 investigational arms. The first arm will contain the direct switch population. This population will switch directly from stable cART to Dolutegravir mono-therapy on baseline visit. The second arm will contain the delayed-switch population. This group will switch from stable cART to Dolutegravir monotherapy 24 weeks after baseline visit. The main goal is to investigate if Dolutegravir mono-therapy could be non-inferior to cART in virological suppressed HIV-1 infected adults. If a interim analysis (performed when 40 patients on dolutegravir monotherapy have passed week 12) shows that it is safe to continue the study an additional 30 patients will be included on top of the 104 patients needed for the primary endpoint analysis. In contrast to the primary endpoint population these additional 30 patients will have a CD4 nadir <200 but a CD4 >350 at the time of the screening visit. Besides that these 30 patients will have to fulfill all other in and exclusion criteria of the primary endpoint population (specifically a viral load never >100.000). These 30 patients are part of a pilot study looking at the possibility to broaden the eligible population in a future larger randomized clinical trial.    ,NCT02401828

HIV,Improving Adherence Among HIV+ Rwandan Youth: A TI-CBTe Indigenous Leader Model, Like most of sub-Saharan Africa Rwandan youth are the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic accounting for 40% of new infections. Antiretroviral (ART) adherence is a global health priority but Rwandan youth are more than twice as likely to be on second line therapy than adults and with a median population age of 18.7 years old adherence is essential for Rwanda's future. Resources to provide youth-centered medical and psychosocial care are limited in Rwanda and young people with HIV face many obstacles to adherence namely the long-term consequences of genocide depression and gender-based violence as well as logistical issues negative attitudes and insufficient parent/caregiver support. Preliminary data underscore the utility of culturally-adapted trauma-informed cognitive behavioral therapy (TI-CBT) in reducing depression and traumatic distress among youth and adults in Rwanda. This project proposes a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test and compare the efficacy of adherence-enhanced Trauma Informed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (i.e. TI-CBTe) to usual care in increasing ART adherence among Rwandan youth from two clinics caring for the largest number of youth with HIV in Rwanda. This proposal answers a compelling need for innovative programs to increase ART adherence among HIV+ youth. If effective the study will build Rwanda's capacity to provide much needed services; and involvement by the Rwanda Biomedical Center will ensure wide dissemination.    ,NCT02464423

HIV,Impact of Pre-ART Blood CD4+ T Cell Level on the Rectal Reservoir in Long-term HIV-1 Treated Men, Although combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically improved quality of life and lifespan of HIV infected individuals it still fails to eliminate viral reservoirs. The Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) is the largest reservoir of HIV-1 as it harbors most of HIV target cells as activated memory Cluster of differentiation (CD)4+/CCR5+ T cells. Intestinal T and B cells express Î±4Î²7 integrin a gut mucosal homing receptor which binds to gp120 HIV-1 envelope facilitating the infection of intestinal T cells and the early establishment of the gut HIV reservoir. Intensive viral replication in the GALT leads to an early impairment of mucosal immunity due to the severe CD4+ T cells depletion that could be also explained by a lack of recruitment in the gut. Among T cells interleukin-(IL-)17 secreting CD4+ T cells (Th17) are particularly depleted during HIV infection. This depletion could be associated with HIV progression since these cells play a crucial role in the maintenance of mucosal immunity. A dysbalance of the Th17/Treg ratio may reflect the loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. These damages are responsible for an increase in microbial translocation which is associated with immune activation and progression to AIDS. Several recent studies have shown that cART initiation during acute or early HIV-1 infection reduces HIV DNA reservoir size and improves immune reconstitution in blood. Post-treatment controllers who started long-term cART early after HIV infection have very low levels of HIV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells similarly to elite controllers. Unlike most HIV-infected individuals they maintain an undetectable plasmatic viral load after several years of cART interruption suggesting that a weak reservoir is a prerequisite to achieve a functional cure. By extrapolation it could be hypothesized that the gut viral reservoir is also decreased and that mucosal immunity is restored when cART is initiated during primary phase of infection. The gut viral reservoir begins to form within the first days after HIV exposure and grows during acute HIV infection. Similarly intestinal T cells are depleted very early after infection due to high viral replication host immune response and bystander effects. Most studies also concluded that long-term and optimal treatment can't fully restore mucosal immunity. These observations led us to study the impact of time of cART start on the size of viral reservoir and on immune reconstitution in the gut. For this we analyzed the virological and immunological characteristics of the rectal HIV reservoir of long-term treated patients regarding their blood CD4+ T cells count at the time of cART initiation.    ,NCT02526940
HIV,Platelets Study: Influence of the Antiretroviral Treatment on the Platelet Physiology During HIV Infection, HIV infection is associated with an immune activation and an inflammatory response - despite an active antiretroviral therapy - which may lead notably but not exclusively to cardiovascular diseases. It has been shown that the use of Protease Inhibitors (PI) instead of Non Nucleosidic Inhibitors (NNRTI) may increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Platelets may play a role in the occurrence of the inflammatory state: they contain big amounts of chemokines growth factors and adhesion proteins. Today the contribution of platelets to the inflammatory state associated with HIV infection has been little studied. Thus it has been shown that platelets in HIV patients are able to release interleukin (IL)-18. The group has shown with others that the platelet function could be altered during HIV infection. Inversely it doesn't know how antiretroviral therapy interacts with platelets. The aim of the study is to evaluate according to the antiretroviral therapy the impact on the platelets activation markers.    ,NCT02532348

HIV,Prospective Evaluation of HIV Patients Using Non-invasive Methods for Estimation of Liver Fibrosis and Steatosis, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a major global health issue with up to 40 million people infected worldwide. Due to highly active antiretroviral therapy mortality related to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been reducing in the last decades. However liver disease remains as an important cause of severe complications and death. Hepatic fibrosis progression is the main responsible for liver-related outcomes in HIV-positive patients. Co-infection by hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly prevalence in HIV patients. Chronic viral co-infection induces faster liver fibrosis progression compared to mono-infected HIV. However published data have been reporting presence of significant liver fibrosis in HIV without HBV or HCV infection. This might be related to direct action of HIV in hepatocytes or association with others factors such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is associated with metabolic factors such as obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus. However antiretroviral drugs may induce abnormal body fat distribution (lipodistrophy) and insulin resistance playing an important role on this process. Liver biopsy has been historically considered as the gold standard to evaluate liver injury. However this painful method presents several limitations. Therefore several non-invasive methods for estimation of liver fibrosis such as biomarkers (APRI FIB-4 FibroTest and FibroMeter) and transient elastography by Fibroscan have been developed as an alternative to liver biopsy. The diagnostic performance and prognostic value of biomarkers and transient elastography have been validated in patients with chronic liver diseases. However few data are available in HIV patients especially in those without chronic viral co-infection. Therefore patients medical doctors and scientific community will be beneficiated by the future application of non-invasive methods for estimation of liver injury in clinical practice in HIV patients.    ,NCT02542020
HIV,A Pilot Study of MONOtherapy of DOlutegravir in HIV-1 Virologically Suppressed Patients, Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend a combination of drugs for the maintenance of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Simplification is considered critical to further scale-up of treatment to support retention in care and to reduce costs. Dolutegravir is a once daily integrase inhibitor that shows very good tolerability efficacy and distinctive resistance profile. The researchers aim at investigating the feasibility of dolutegravir monotherapy in maintenance therapy. Briefly 10 virologically suppressed patients for at least six months on conventional triple ART of dolutegravir plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) will be switched to dolutegravir monotherapy for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the number of patients completing 24 weeks of dolutegravir monotherapy without experiencing virological failure.    ,NCT02572947

HIV,Safety and Efficacy of Allogenic Adoptive Cell Therpy for Immune Reconstitution in Chronic HIV-1 Infected Patients, Chronic HIV-1 infection is generally characterized by progressive CD4+ T cell depletion associated with risk of opportunistic infections. In clinical about 20% of patients who exhibit stable viral suppression by HAART still fail to achieve sufficient immune reconstitution and often experience an increased risk of opportunistic infections. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized donor peripheral-blood stem cells based on HLA-mismatched allogeneic transplantation have been demonstrated to boost host immunity against tumor and promote hemopoiesis without acute graft-versus-host disease. Thus it may represent a novel treatment as allogenic adoptive cell therapy (AACT). Here the investigators propose a hypothesis that AACT can promote hemopoiesis in bone marrow and attenuate immune-mediated inflammation which subsequently lead to the restoration of CD4 T-cell counts and reconstitution of host immunity in HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT02648516
HIV,Safety and Efficacy of Allogenic Adoptive Cell Therpy for Immunodeficiency in Chronic HIV-1 Infected Patients, HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells that eventually leads to clinically significant immunodeficiency. Severely immunosuppressed patients often experience an increased risk of opportunistic infection. A chronic generalized immune activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion loss of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. However it is still unknown whether reducing immune activation will restore CD4 T cell counts and leading to the restoration of immunodeficiency in chronic HIV infection.Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized donor peripheral-blood stem cells based on HLA mismatched allogeneic transplantation have been demonstrated to boost host immunity against tumor attenuate immune-mediated inflammation promote hemopoiesis without acute graft-versus-host disease. Thus it may represent a novel treatment as adoptive therapy of allogenic adoptive cell therapy (AACT). Here the investigators propose a hypothesis that AACT therapy can promote hemopoiesis in bone marrow and attenuate immune-mediated inflammation which subsequently lead to the restoration of immunodeficiency in HIV-infected patients.    ,NCT02651376

HIV,HIV Drug Switch Followed by HCV Therapy in HIV-HCV Co-Infection, This is an prospective open label pilot study conducted over 32 weeks. A total of 25 eligible participants who are infected with HCV and HIV will be recruited from 2 Canadian HIV Trials Network (CTN) sites (Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and McGill University Health Centre) This study is looking into the effectiveness of a combination of Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir Alafenamide Single Tablet Regimen (E/C/F/TAF STR) for HIV treatment and Harvoni for HCV treatment . This study will assess the effect that the study drug has on the metabolism of sugar the changes in fat in the bloodstream and other metabolic changes. Metabolism is the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food you eat. This study may provide information on the impact of liver fibrosis (scarring of liver tissues) on metabolic changes before during and after HCV antiviral therapy. Drug-drug interactions (DDI) DDI between E/C/F/TAF and LPV-SOF have been well evaluated and no clinically significant interactions have been identified. A switch to E/C/F/TAF in the context of LPV-SOF HCV antiviral treatment preparation may be particularly beneficial because of its:   1. favorable side effect profile   2. once daily STR formulation   3. known DDI profile with LPV-SOF   4. neutral effect on liver fibrosis   5. improved kidney and bone safety profile with the use of TAF Conduct of this study is justified as it:   1. Assesses a minimal pill count and dosing frequency strategy of co-treatment of HIV and HCV using well tolerated medications with an excellent safety profile and known DDI profile.   2. Provides additional safety data for TAF in the HIV-HCV co-infected population.   3. Quantifies adherence and identifies obstacles to full adherence in this population. There is a paucity of data related to DAA adherence in licensing studies.   4. Provides real-world safety and efficacy data to support the public funding for LPV-SOF DAA therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected populations.   5. Provides preliminary data on the immunologic and metabolic consequences of HCV clearance in HIV-HCV co-infection   6. As a pilot study the information gathered will inform the feasibility of future clinical trials evaluating novel treatment strategies for HIV-HCV co-infected patients.    ,NCT02660905

HIV,BRIDGE: Improving HIV Service Delivery for People Who Inject Drugs, Scaling up integrated cost-efficient HIV services for people who inject drugs (PWID) in Needle Syringe Programs (NSPs) is urgently needed in Kazakhstan where only one-third of the estimated 19000 HIV-positive PWID are ever linked to HIV care and only 10% initiate ART with 4% achieving viral suppression. The study's aim is to evaluate the implementation effectiveness and sustainability of an integrated HIV service model in 24 NSPs located in 4 Kazakhstani cities. This model will employ highly effective strategies that will include peer-driven recruitment of PWID in NSPs using social network strategies (SNS) integrating rapid HIV testing in NSPs with HIV Care Clinic nurses and linking HIV positive PWID in NSPs to HIV care using the ARTAS (Anti-Retroviral Treatment and Access to Services) case management model. Findings will have important public health implications for improving HIV service delivery for PWID in the Central Asian region and other countries with injection driven epidemics.    ,NCT02796027

HIV,Factors Associated With Late HIV Diagnosis in Grampian: an Epidemiological Study, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major global health concern which has resulted in an estimated 39 million deaths world-wide. Although it is now a treatable medical condition there is still avoidable morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection in the UK. Late diagnosis (CD4 count of <350 cells/mm3 or AIDS-defining illness irrespective of CD4 count) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality increased risk of transmission impaired response to antiretroviral therapy and increased healthcare costs. In Grampian 49% of patients were diagnosed late between 1984 and 2011. Therefore the aim of the study is to determine the factors associated with late HIV diagnosis in Grampian between 2009 and 2014 to ascertain whether diagnoses could have been made earlier. The study constitutes a secondary data analysis. Individuals newly diagnosed with HIV between January 2009 and December 2014 were identified from a Health Protection Scotland (HPS) database. The majority of outcome data were extracted from the existing HPS database. Missing data were collected via a retrospective review of patient case-notes laboratory reports and an electronic patient management system. Patients were classified as early or late diagnosis and comparisons were made between the groups using statistical tests. The study sought to provide a basis for recommendations for improvement of information and services to facilitate earlier HIV diagnosis in Grampian.    ,NCT02804724

HIV,Supporting Adolescents to Adhere - an Intervention Using Airtime Rewards Allocated by a Prize Drawing, This study is an extension of Reminding Adolescents to Adhere (RATA) (Unique protocol ID: 1R01HD074925-01). Participants for SATA will be recruited during the RATA month 24 exit survey. Participants will be randomized 1:1:1 into either one of two intervention group (receiving the weekly messages and a chance to draw a prize at each clinic visit based on either a fixed adherence level of 90% or a self-chosen one of at least 80% as further detailed below) or the control group that receives the existing RATA intervention consisting of weekly motivational messages and the chance to get mobile airtime rewards conditional on responding. Doing so will allow the investigators to cleanly evaluate the impact of these additional adherence-based lotteries and guarantees that those who have been in the control group receiving standard of care in the first 24 months of the RATA intervention will also receive an intervention for reasons of fairness.    ,NCT02918838
HIV,Digital Star: HIV Prevention for Youth in Mental Health Treatment, Teenagers in mental health treatment are at greater risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. This greater risk comes from many factors some of which are related to poor emotion regulation and low self-confidence. There is a need for an HIV prevention program specifically for these at-risk teens. The goal of this study is to develop a computerized HIV prevention study tailored to adolescents in mental health treatment. The first part of the study will develop core sessions of D*STAR. It will do this by using focus group feedback from approximately 15 adolescents in mental health treatment and approximately 10 parents of youth in mental health treatment and mental health treatment center staff. Feedback on D*STAR prototype sessions will also be collected from two individual interviews with approximately 15 youth in mental health treatment. Core sessions will then be reviewed in an open trial with approximately 30 adolescents. The second part of the study will develop and refine digital versions of the remaining sessions of STAR and a digital general health promotion intervention. It will do this by using focus group feedback from approximately 20 adolescents in mental health treatment and approximately 10 community advisory board members which include variety of staff from mental health treatment settings such as administrators supervisors therapists health teachers at therapeutic schools clinicians at day hospitals and day treatment programs parents of youth in mental health treatment and from relevant community organizations such as those serving lesbian gay bisexual transgender and questioning youth. Feedback on D*STAR prototype sessions will also be collected from two individual interviews with approximately 20 youth in mental health treatment. All developed sessions (from both Phase I and Phase II) will then be reviewed in an open trial with approximately 20 adolescents. A randomized control trial (RCT) will then be conducted to compare D*STAR to a time matched digital general health promotion intervention among approximately 120 adolescents. For the pilot and RCT phases assessments will be administered prior to randomization immediately following the last intervention session and at one month post-intervention (pilot study) or at three month post-intervention (RCT).    ,NCT02921841

HIV,MAMAS: Mentoring Adolescent Mothers at School, This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention designed to reduce STI/HIV incidence by increasing the number of adolescent mothers who re-enroll and remain in school. The objective of the intervention is to have older mentor mothers who themselves were pregnant adolescents to mentor younger adolescent mothers. Mentor mothers will provide ongoing psychosocial support help navigate re-admission to school and help facilitate access to an existing State-sponsored cash transfer the child support grant (CSG) in the early postpartum period. Our combination social protection program will enhance resilience of young adolescent mothers to facilitate their return to school and thereby reduce HIV risk. The investigators will evaluate the efficacy of the intervention using a pre-test post-test randomized controlled trial design. Participants in the intervention will receive the Mentoring Adolescent Mothers At School (MAMAS) intervention and standard postpartum care. Those in the control arm will receive standard postpartum care. Additionally for those participants randomized to the intervention arm mentor mothers will use participatory visual methods (e.g. photovoice cell-films drawings) as part of the intervention itself. Last among those participants randomized to the intervention arm and who return for their 9-month assessment the investigators will conduct 20 in-depth interviews to understand the process of resilience development from their perspective.

HIV,Impact of Recombinant Human Growth Hormone on HIV Persistence, Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the health of more than 18 million people infected with HIV by controlling viral replication AIDS and non-AIDS events and by reducing the risk of transmission. However the existence of latent viral reservoirs in long-lived memory CD4 T cells remains a hurdle to curing HIV infection; consequently patients must remain on ART for the rest of their lives. Recently a more realistic approach under limelight is to identify strategies leading to a functional cure which is defined as the natural control of viral reservoir by the host. Use of recombinant human growth hormone has been shown to improve immune function by several mechanisms. This study hypothesizes that treatment with recombinant human growth hormone will decrease the size of the replication competent HIV reservoir in HIV-infected immune-reconstituted individuals. The specific study objectives include:   -  To evaluate the effect of recombinant human growth hormone administration for 48 weeks on the size of the replication competent HIV reservoir   -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of recombinant human growth hormone administration for 48 weeks in HIV-infected individuals on suppressive ART. For this purpose the investigators will add recombinant human growth hormone treatment for the patients receiving stable ART. Approximately 22 participants will be enrolled in this study at the Chronic Viral Illness Service of the McGill University Health Centre (Montreal Canada) which will last about 52 weeks. Participants will be treated with recombinant human growth hormone for a total of 48 weeks. The initial recombinant human growth hormone dose will be 3 mg/day (30-40 Âµg/kg/d) for 24 weeks administered by subcutaneous injection on an outpatient basis followed by dose reduction to 1.5 mg/day for the final 24 weeks of the treatment period also conducted on an outpatient basis. The study inclusion criteria include male and female participants ??8 and <40 years of age with an undetectable viral load (the quantity of the HIV virus in the blood must be less than 50 copies/ml) during last 24 months and with a CD4 T-cell count ??50 cells/mm3 obtained within 30 days prior to study entry. The findings from this study will contribute to the development of novel strategies to eradicate HIV.    ,NCT03091374
HIV,Impact of Integrated HIV/NCD Screening on HIV Testing Uptake and Engagement in HIV Care In Kisarawe Tanzania, This study focuses on the integration of HIV and NCD screening and care. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the intervention strategy in Kisarawe District Tanzania a rural area 40 KM southwest of Dar es Salaam. The study will match two similar HIV care and treatment centers (CTC) in the District one of which will be randomized to receive the enhanced intervention which will integrate diabetes (DM) and hypertension (HTN) screening with the existing HIV testing program and integrate care for DM and HTN into the HIV care program. Comparisons of the community HIV testing rates in the two communities engagement in HIV care among those testing positive and 24-month retention in HIV care will be assessed among a cohort of 89 newly enrolled patients per community. Specifically the aims are to determine:   1. Whether integrating DM and HTN screening with HIV testing will increase the uptake of community-level HIV testing.   2. If integrating DM/HTN care with HIV care enhances engagement in HIV care.   3. Whether integration of DM/HTN care with HIV care enhances retention in HIV care for those newly enrolled in HIV care.   4. The cost-effectiveness of integrating NCD screening and care with HIV screening and care with regard to the incremental cost per HIV infected client engaged in HIV care and cost per newly enrolled HIV client retained in HIV care over 24-months.    ,NCT03098654

HIV,A Study of the Neurological Effects of Adding Raltegravir to HAART Regimen in Patients With HIV," HIV related cognitive impairment still occurs despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HIV disease affects the brain in 20-40% of patients with advancing HIV disease leading to varying degrees of cognitive impairment recently termed HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HAND may occur in patients who are virally suppressed in both blood and CSF. Patients with HIV Associated Neurological Disorders (HAND) who are virally suppressed in both their blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) whilst on a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen may have significant cognitive improvement with HAART intensification with the medication RaltegravirÍ¾ compared to those who remain on their existing regimen. This study will be a prospective interventional randomised and unblinded controlled clinical trial. The aim of this study will be to determine whether HAART intensification with the medication Raltegravir leads to significant improvement in HIV associated neurological disorders (HAND). Patients with the recent progression (within 6 months) of HAND (validated by neuropsychological assessment) on HAART who are virally suppressed (<50 copies per ml) in blood and CSF will be randomised to have their existing HAART regimen intensified with raltegravir 400mg twice daily or not. The control arm will remain on their medication regimen as prescribed. The target is to enrol 110 patients into the control group and 110 patients into the Raltegravir intensification group. Patients will undergo baseline neuropsychological testing MRI blood tests and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) tests (via a lumbar puncture). The methods used to determine the effectiveness of adding Raltegravir will include further neuropsychological testing at 6 months; and neuropsychological testing MRI and CSF assessment at 12 months. Neuropsychological testing completed at 6 and 12 months will be completed by a ""blind assessor"" in that they will have no knowledge of which arm (treatment or control) the participant is enrolled in. An evaluation (neuropsychological testing) will be performed should the patient deteriorate during the course of the study as recognised by the patient's managing physician. The decision of the Antiretroviral medication regimen to be used in such a case will be determined by the managing physician. At the end of the study protocol (12 months) the patient's HAART therapy will be managed by their primary physician.    ",NCT01448486

HIV,Multi-level Determinants of Starting ART Late: Aim 2, The availability of HIV care and treatment programs is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa. However more than half the patients who need HIV medicines are still not receiving this antiretroviral therapy (ART) and this can lead to early death from AIDS. One of the problems in this region is that patients start ART late after the HIV disease is very advanced. This results in high death rates soon after ART initiation. The way clinic-level factors such as the way services and referrals are organized how referrals are regarded counseling messages and record-keeping contribute to late ART initiation is unclear. As the second phase of a 3-phase NIH-sponsored project this study will identify clinic-level enablers and barriers to timely enrollment into HIV care and ART initiation. A cross-sectional qualitative study will be conducted at 4 selected HIV care and treatment clinics and the health facilities in which they are located in Ethiopia. Data will be collected using 4 methods:   1. Data abstraction   2. Key informant interviews with clinic personnel   3. Observation of post-test counseling sessions in the VCT clinic   4. Observation of provider-patient interactions in the care and treatment clinic Identifying modiï¬able health facility-level predictors of late ART initiation will facilitate implementation of interventions programs and policies that will increase the number of patients who enroll in HIV care and initiate ART early. Additionally results will inform the design of the third phase of the NIH-project referenced above.    ,NCT01997346
HIV,Multi-level Determinants of Starting ART Late: Aim 3, The availability of HIV care and treatment programs is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa. However more than half the patients who need HIV treatment are still not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). This can lead to early death from AIDS. Additionally many patients start ART late after the HIV disease is very advanced. This results in high death rates soon after starting ART. The factors that contribute to late ART initiation are still unclear. This study will identify factors that help patients to enroll or prevent them from enrolling into HIV care and starting ART on time. We will examine the characteristics of all patients initiating ART at study sites. We will also look at potential risk factors among patients who initiate ART late (cases) compared to patients who initiate earlier (controls) at 6 HIV care and treatment clinics in Ethiopia. Data will be collected using 2 methods:   1. Face-to-face interviews with participants using questionnaires   2. Obtaining clinical data from the electronic patient-level database Identifying factors that help patients to start or prevent them from starting ART on time will help to direct interventions programs and policies to reduce early death.    ,NCT01997359
HIV,Enhanced Prevention in Couples: Feasibility Study #2, The purpose of this study is to gather information needed to develop a large prevention trial to decrease risk for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission among HIV-discordant couples (where one person is HIV-positive and the other is HIV-negative) in Lesotho. The protocol team would like to explore new strategies for increasing the number of partners who receive an HIV test and whether this increase in testing also results in identifying HIV-discordant couples. These couples would be the focus of the future large prevention trial therefore it is critical that the protocol team explore effective strategies for identifying and recruiting these couples. Men and women (index participants) who are attending antenatal (ANC) and Tuberculosis (TB) clinics will be recruited for this study. If they agree to take part a testing team will visit their household and offer all adults staying in the house the opportunity to receive an HIV test. Three hundred index participants will be enrolled into the study and have their homes visited by the testing team. The number of household members tested will depend on the number of people living in each household.    ,NCT02027441

HIV,Tesamorelin Effects on Liver Fat and Histology in HIV, Liver disease is one of the leading co-morbidities of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is present in approximately 30-40% of patients with HIV infection. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more severe form of NAFLD in which increased liver fat is also accompanied by inflammation cellular damage and fibrosis. NAFLD is most prevalent in patients who also have increased visceral adiposity and our group has previously shown that HIV-infected individuals with increased visceral adiposity generally have decreased growth hormone secretion. Tesamorelin is a growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue that increases endogenous growth hormone secretion. Tesamorelin is FDA-approved for the reduction of visceral fat in HIV-infected individuals. In a previous study treatment with tesamorelin in HIV-infected individuals selected for abdominal adiposity reduced liver fat. The current study is designed to test the effect of tesamorelin on liver fat and steatohepatitis in HIV-infected individuals who have NAFLD. The investigators hypothesize that tesamorelin will reduce liver fat and will also ameliorate the inflammation fibrosis and hepatocellular damage seen in conjunction with NASH.    ,NCT02196831
HIV,Repeat Doses of SB-728mR-T After Cyclophosphamide Conditioning in HIV-Infected Subjects on HAART, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of T-cell immunotherapy (SB-728mR-T) following cyclophosphamide conditioning. CCR5 is a major co-receptor for HIV entry into T-cells. Disruption of CCR5 by zinc finger nuclease (SB-728mR) blocks HIV entry into the T-cells therefore protects the T-cells from HIV infection. Safety (primary outcome) and anti-viral effect (secondary outcome) of zinc finger nuclease-mediated CCR5 disrupted autologous T-cells (SB-728mR-T) will be evaluated in the study.    ,NCT02225665

HIV,Comparison of MK-1439A and ATRIPLA??in Treatment-Naive Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Infected Participants (MK-1439A-021), The purpose of this study is to compare the antiretroviral activity of MK-1439A a single-tablet once-daily (q.d.) fixed-dose combination (FDC) containing MK-1439 100 mg + lamivudine 300 mg + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg with ATRIPLA??a single-tablet FDC containing efavirenz 600 mg + emtricitabine 200 mg + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg in treatment-naive participants infected with HIV. The primary hypothesis is that MK-1439A q.d. is non-inferior to ATRIPLA??q.d. as assessed by the proportion of participants with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) <50 copies/mL (by the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay) at Week 48.    ,NCT02403674
HIV,Regular HIV Testing Among At-Risk Latino Men, Early HIV diagnosis followed by linkage to treatment soon after HIV infection can reduce mortality and prevent new HIV infections. To obtain the full benefit of early HIV diagnosis the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that high risk groups get tested for HIV regularly every three to six months. This study will examine the feasibility of a strategy to promote regular HIV testing and HIV risk reduction among Latino men at risk for HIV which if successful will help to identify Latino men unaware of their HIV status benefitting them and the society.    ,NCT02454725
HIV,Shedding Immunogenicity and Safety of Quadrivalent Live Intranasal Influenza Vaccine (QLAIV) in HIV-infected Children and Young Adults, The goal of this study is to determine if there is a difference in shedding (primary objective) and in immunogenicity and safety (secondary objectives) between HIV-positive and HIV-negative children and young adults who are receiving the quadrivalent live-attenuated influenza vaccine (QLAIV).    ,NCT02474901
HIV,Steering Together in a New Direction: Reducing the Risk of HIV/STD Among African American Men, African American men have by far the highest rates of HIV in the US but there are few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions to dissuade heterosexually active African American men from engaging sexual risk behavior. This research seeks to address this gap in the behavioral intervention literature. That self-initiated behavior change as well as intervention-induced behavior change is often short-lived eroding over time is widely known; accordingly this research also seeks to test a strategy to sustain intervention efficacy. In a RCT African American men 18 to 45 years reporting recent unprotected intercourse with a woman will be randomized to the Steering Together in a New Direction (STAND) HIV Risk Reduction Intervention or a No-Intervention Control Condition. To test a strategy to sustain intervention effects the men also will be randomized to receive or not receive individually tailored text messages. The theoretical basis of the interventions is social cognitive theory and the reasoned action approach which is an extension of the theory of planned behavior and the theory of reasoned action. Men will complete self-report measures via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing at baseline and immediately post and 6 and 12 months post-intervention. The trial will test whether the STAND HIV Risk Reduction Intervention as compared with the No-Intervention Control Condition increases consistent condom use the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include unprotected intercourse multiple sexual partners insertive anal intercourse and proportion condom-protected intercourse. The trial will also test whether STAND's efficacy is greater among men in the Text Messaging Intervention compared with men not receiving text messages. This will provide information on the utility of a low-cost strategy to extend an intervention's efficacy. Finally the study will test for mediation of intervention effects: the hypothesis that STAND affects outcome expectancies and self-efficacy which in turn affect consistent condom use.    ,NCT02572401

HIV,New Strategies to Assess Anal Cancer Risk In Women, The purpose of this research is to study different strategies to identify women at highest risk for anal cancer. Primarily investigators want to study a risk assessment called the Anal Cancer Risk Index; it gives women an overall number score based on risk factors that they may have for anal cancer such as age number of sexual partners or smoking. Investigators seek to understand whether women with higher Anal Cancer Risk Index scores are more likely to have abnormal results on anal pap smears HPV tests or anal biopsies. The study team will collect swabs of the cervix and the anus to study different laboratory tests that could identify women at highest risk of cervical and anal cancer. These laboratory tests include an anal pap smear tests for markers of disease and tests that detect the HPV types most likely to cause cancer. The study team would like to see which of these laboratory tests do the best job at predicting precancerous lesions in the anus and are better indicators of risk for cancer. After collecting these swabs women will have a procedure called high resolution anoscopy where investigators look closely at the anus and biopsy any suspicious areas. Finally the study team will look for HPV proteins and changes that HPV can make in cells to see if these tests predict anal lesions.    ,NCT02873741

HIV,Soy Modulation of Immune Activation LDL- Levels and Lowering Inflammation by Pretzel Isoflavone Dietary Intervention, Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART HIV medications) dramatically increases the expected lifespan of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)infected patients; yet the risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as heart attacks and stroke are increased in this population. This increased risk may be linked to persistent inflammation and activation of the immune system. Although the relationship between cardiovascular disease and HIV-infected individuals who are taking HIV medications is not well understood the team of researchers involved in this study observed that a diet rich in soy at levels recommended by the FDA (Federal Drug Administration) improved cholesterol levels and inflammation in individuals not infected with HIV. From this study the researchers hope to gain understanding on how dietary soy will impact HIV-infected individuals who are taking HIV medications. Two pretzels with and without soy developed at OSU (Ohio State University) in the Department of Food Science and Technology and used in previous clinical trials will be used to investigate how the pretzel snacks will affect your cardiovascular disease risk immunity and how your body breaks down naturally occurring chemicals from soy.    ,NCT02818283

HIV,Men Together Making a Difference: Reducing HIV/STD Risk Behavior Among South African Men, Sub-Saharan Africa has about 10% of the world's population but was home to more than 60% of all people living with HIV in 2003. South Africa continues to have the largest number of people living with HIV in the world and as in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa heterosexual exposure is the primary HIV transmission category. Worldwide efforts to stem the spread of HIV among heterosexuals have stressed the impact of HIV on women. Oft-cited statistics indicate that about half of all people living with HIV are women. The strategies typically offered to address the impact of HIV on women are interventions with women. To be sure there is an alternative approach to addressing women's risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV one that would be an important complement to the predominant approach: namely focusing on men. By reducing men's sexual risk behavior it should be possible to reduce rates of HIV in both men and women. Men's rates would decline because they are the recipients of the intervention; women's rates would decline because they have sex with men. Interventions aimed at men could take into account the power that men have in sexual decision-making and risk taking. However whether one considers the US literature or the international literature few randomized controlled trials of HIV/STD risk-reduction interventions have focused on heterosexual men. Accordingly the purpose of this research is to develop and test the efficacy of an intervention to curb HIV/STD risk-associated behavior in South African men who have sex with women. A cluster-randomized control trial design will be used to reduce the potential for contamination between treatment arms that would be present if individuals were randomized. An attention control group will be used to control for Hawthorne effects special attention and group interaction. Matched pairs of neighborhoods in Black townships in Eastern Cape Province South Africa similar on key characteristics will be created 22 pairs will be randomly selected and men will be recruited. One neighborhood in each pair will be randomly assigned to each of the 2 study arms. The primary hypothesis is that men who receive a culturally appropriate theory-based HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention will be more likely to report consistently using condoms during vaginal intercourse in the 12-month post intervention period than will men who receive an attention-control intervention controlling for baseline condom use.    ,NCT01490359
HIV,Real-life Effectiveness of the Kaletra Adherence Support Assistance (KASA) Program, The study will assess the effectiveness of KASA (Kaletra Patient Support Program) on improving or maintaining treatment adherence in HIV positive patients that have been initiated on treatment with KaletraÂ®. This will be a purely observational study conducted on patients that will be on treatment with KaletraÂ®. All treatments will be as per routine care including the use of KASA which will be determined exclusively by the physician and the patient without consideration of the study. The efficacy of disease management programs as assessed in randomized clinical trials is not representative of real - life effectiveness observed under routine clinical practice. In real - life settings the utilization of and compliance with disease management programs by physicians and patients is not uniform. Therefore assessment of their true effectiveness is ideally conducted under a pure observational setting without any interference from the investigators with respect to making the programs available to patients and enforcing their adherence to them.    ,NCT01662336

HIV,Pilot Study of Bydureon to Treat Diabetes in HIV-infected Adults, This pilot study will evaluate the effects of the anti-diabetic drug Bydureon (exenatide extended-release formulation) on blood sugar levels and serum markers of inflammation in a cohort of 12 HIV-infected adults on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with untreated diabetes mellitus. Previous studies have shown that high levels of persistent systemic inflammation predict the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in HIV-infected persons on cART (a group at very high risk of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction). Bydureon has demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects in prior studies of non-HIV infected persons which suggests that this agent may represent a unique and preferred medication for the treatment of insulin resistance in HIV-infected adults. The Investigators hypothesize that short-term (16 weeks) therapy with Bydureon will improve glucose tolerance and significantly reduce circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and highly-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) two biomarkers strongly implicated in the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in diabetic HIV-infected cART-treated adults.    ,NCT01791465

HIV,Being Responsible for Ourselves HIV Risk Reduction for Black MSM, The incidence of HIV/AIDS among African American men who have sex with men (MSM) is alarming and the public health response to this urgent situation has been hampered by a lack of sexual risk reduction interventions with solid evidence of efficacy in this population. Accordingly the broad long-term objective of the proposed research is to identify interventions to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infection (STI) among African American MSM. This application seeks funds to develop and test the efficacy of a theory-based contextually appropriate behavioral intervention to reduce sexual risk behavior among African American MSM. Intervention development will be guided by social cognitive theory the theory of planned behavior qualitative information from focus groups and findings from a longitudinal survey of men from the study population. A one-on-one intervention will be utilized to address the specific prevention needs of each man and to allay participants' concerns about revealing their sexual involvement with men by virtue of participating in a group or workshop intervention. The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial design with baseline immediate post intervention and 6 and 12 months post intervention assessments. The participants will be African American MSM who will be randomized to a one-on-one sexual risk reduction intervention or a one-on-one health promotion intervention that will serve as the control condition. The primary outcome is consistent condom use during anal and vaginal intercourse. The study will test whether the intervention increases the consistent use of condoms during anal intercourse the primary outcome whether it decreases other sexual risk behaviors and whether social cognitive theory variables mediate the effects of the intervention on consistent condom use. This study will provide an urgently needed intervention to reduce the risk of HIV and other STIs in one of the highest risk populations in the United States.    ,NCT02561286

HIV,Dolutegravir Renal Impairment Study, Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on behalf of Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare LLC. DTG is metabolized primarily by uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UGT)1A1 with a minor role of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A and with renal elimination of unchanged drug being extremely low (< 1% of the dose). Fifty-three percent of the total oral dose is excreted unchanged in the feces but it is unknown if all or part of this is due to unabsorbed drug or some percentage of biliary excretion of the glucuronide conjugate which can be further degraded to form the parent compound in the gut lumen. The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for renal impairment studies states that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in patients with renal impairment should be conducted even for those drugs primarily metabolized or secreted in bile because renal impairment can inhibit some pathways of hepatic and gut drug metabolism and transport. This study is planned as an open label single-dose pharmacokinetic study to evaluate plasma DTG pharmacokinetics following oral administration to subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and matched healthy controls. Results from this study are expected to enable the development of appropriate dosing recommendations in patients with renal impairment.    ,NCT01353716
HIV,Drug Interaction Study Between Dolutegravir and Prednisone, Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. DTG is primarily metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) with cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 pathway as a minor route. Corticosteroids have demonstrated induction effects on UGTs and CYP3A4. Corticosteroids are often used in HIV-infected subjects and have the potential to reduce DTG exposure due to enzyme induction when co-administered. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether concomitant prednisone administration can affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DTG. The study is a two part two period open label study. Part 1 will evaluate the effect of a high prednisone dose on DTG PK with the potential for an additional Part 2 depending on the results from Part 1. In Part 1 approximately 12 healthy subjects will receive DTG 50mg q24h for 5 days in Period 1. Subjects will then be administered DTG 50mg q24h in combination with prednisone 60mg for 5 days followed by a 5 day taper (total duration of 10 days) in Period 2. PK data of DTG will be obtained from Part 1 and used to inform decision making on the need for Part 2. If DTG exposure is reduced by more than 50% in Part 1 Part 2 will be carried out where a second cohort of subjects will receive DTG 50mg q24h DTG for 5 days in Period 1 followed by DTG 50mg q24h in combination with prednisone 20mg for 5 days followed by a 5 day taper (total duration of 10 days) in Period 2. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples for DTG will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. All doses of study drugs will be taken following a moderate fat meal. This study will be conducted at one center in the United States with healthy adult male and female subjects.    ,NCT01425099
HIV,Dolutegravir Compared to Darunavir/Ritonavir  Each in Combination With Dual Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) in ART-naive Subjects, This study will be conducted in approximately 468 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naÃ¯ve subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects) or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800 mg/100 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects) each in combination with fixed-dose dual nucleoside reverse transriptase inhibitor (NRTI) therapy (either abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC). Subjects will be stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA and background NRTI selection. The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes 48 weeks on therapy; an additional analysis will be conducted after the last subject completes Week 96 on study.    ,NCT01449929
HIV,Drug Exposure Registry for GSK2248761 an Investigational NNRTI, The World Health Organization has estimated that as many as 10% of the population worldwide may at some point experience at least one seizure. The percentage with active epilepsy is from 0.4% to 1%. From 40% to 65% of patients with HIV infection have been estimated to have some neurological involvement; the percentage reaches as high as 70% to 80% when post-mortem assessments are included. Estimates of the percentage of HIV-infected patients with seizure occurrence have varied widely with one review finding a range from 2% to 20%. The highest percentage in this range was reported at a center that exclusively treated patients with neurological involvement in India where HIV clade C subtype is predominant. Query of another neurology department's database determined that of the HIV-infected patients treated at the center all of whom were referred for neurological symptoms 6.1% experienced seizures. Underlying neurologic diseases in these patients included HIV-associated encephalopathy progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and toxoplasmosis. In a Spanish population 3% of HIV-infected patients over a one-year study period were found to have new-onset seizures which were attributed to drug toxicity in 47% intracranial lesions in 35% and metabolic derangements in 12%. Drug-discontinuation studies magnetic resonance imaging studies and animal studies have produced recent evidence that some antiretroviral therapies may have neurotoxic effects warranting further research. Individuals who are treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy are at risk for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in which immune recovery triggers clinical deterioration as the newly invigorated immune system reacts to pathogens that either represent ongoing opportunistic infection or were previously successfully controlled. In a population initiating combination antiretroviral therapy between 1999 and 2007 0.9% developed neurological manifestations of IRIS. Seizures may occur as part of a neurological IRIS syndrome such as encephalitis and toxoplasmosis. Two randomized Phase 2b dose-finding studies were conducted in HIV-1 infected adults to compare GSK2248761 100 mg and 200 mg given once daily as part of an antiretroviral treatment regimen. One of the studies (SGN113399) was in subjects with prior exposure to antiretroviral therapy where GSK2248761 100 mg and 200 mg once daily were compared to determine the best dose in this population. A contemporary control arm receiving etravirine 200 mg twice daily was also included and all arms included a twice-daily background therapy consisting of darunavir/ritonavir 600 mg/100 mg plus raltegravir 400 mg. The other study (SGN113404) was in treatment-naÃ¯ve subjects comparing GSK2248761 100 mg and 200 mg once daily to determine the best dose in this population. A contemporary control arm receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily was also included and all arms were given background therapy selected by investigators from either once-daily abacavir/lamivudine 600 mg/300 mg or tenofovir/emtricitabine 300 mg/200 mg. Of a planned total population in both studies of 300 subjects 35 were enrolled before the studies were terminated because of the occurrence of seizures in five subjects. All of the subjects who experienced seizures were enrolled into SGN113399 four randomized to receive 200 mg GSK2248761 and one randomized to receive 100 mg GSK2248761. There were no seizures in the subjects receiving GSK2248761 in study SGN113404. At the time of study termination subjects had been enrolled and received GSK2248761 at 19 sites in four countries: France Romania United States and Germany. Although potential contributory conditions have been identified in some cases definitive causative factors for the seizure occurrence have not been established. The purpose of this study is to follow subjects who previously received GSK2248761 while enrolled in the Phase 2b studies which were halted due to unexpected seizures. The study will collect data on all subjects and will be used to monitor for additional seizures as well as collect additional clinical data on all subjects.    ,NCT01458132
HIV,Drug Interaction Study Between Dolutegravir and an Oral Contraceptive Containing Norgestimate and Ethinylestradiol, Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of HIV infection. DTG will likely be used in women on oral contraceptives (OC) for birth control. Based on accumulated non-clinical and clinical drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic data there is a low likelihood of drug interaction between DTG and most widely used OC drugs. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of DTG administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a commonly used oral contraceptive product Ortho-Cyclen (combination of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol) in healthy female subjects. Each subject will participate in a Run-in period (if needed) followed by two treatment periods. Approximately 16 subjects will be randomized in a cross-over fashion to either Ortho-Cyclen with DTG or Ortho-Cyclen with Placebo for 10 days and switch to the alternate treatment for another 10 days. Subjects will return to the study center for final follow up evaluations 7 - 14 days after the final dose of study medication.    ,NCT01498861
HIV,A Study of the Pharmacokinetics and Antiviral Activity of Dolutegravir in the Central Nervous System in HIV-1 Infected ART-naive Subjects, ING116070 is a Phase IIIb single-arm open-label multicenter study.

HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Boceprevir and Telaprevir on Dolutegravir Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Adult Subjects (ING115697).," Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Co-infection with Hepatitis C (HCV) is common in HIV-infected subjects therefore it is expected that DTG will be coadministered with treatments for HCV. Boceprevir (BCV) and Telaprevir (TVR) are protease inhibitors for the treatment of HCV that were recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency (FDA/EMA) and have rapidly been adopted to ""standard of care"" in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavarin. This is a single-center open-label two-cohort two-period one-way study in healthy adult subjects. A total of approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled in order to obtain 24 evaluable subjects (12 per cohort). In the first treatment period all subjects will receive DTG 50 mg once daily for 5 days (treatment A). In period 2 subjects will receive DTG 50 mg once daily plus either BCV 800 mg q8h (treatment B) for 10 days or TVR 750 mg q8h (treatment C) for 10 days. There will be no washout between treatments. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. Subjects will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug two treatment periods and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. This study will be conducted at one center in the US with healthy adult male and female subjects.    ",NCT01563328
HIV,Study Assessing Dolutegravir in HIV-1 Infected Subjects With Virus Resistant to Raltegravir and/or Elivitegravir, Study ING116529 is a multicenter randomized study with an initial 7 day placebo- controlled functional monotherapy phase to quantify the antiviral activity attributable to dolutegravir (DTG) in HIV-1 infected ART-experienced adults who are experiencing virological failure on an Integrase inhibitor containing regimen (current RAL or ELV failures) with evidence of genotypic resistance to RAL or ELV at study entry. Thirty subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either DTG 50mg BID (Arm A) or Placebo (Arm B) with the current failing regimen for 7 days (RAL or ELV should be discontinued prior to dosing with DTG). At Day 8 subjects from both arms will enter an open label phase and receive open label DTG 50mg BID with an optimized background regimen containing at least one fully active drug.    ,NCT01568892
HIV,A Study to Investigate the Safety Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Repeat Dose Administration of Long-Acting GSK1265744 and Long-Acting TMC278 Intramuscular and Subcutaneous Injections in Healthy Adult Subjects, LAI115428 is a Phase I randomized repeat dose escalation study to determine the safety tolerability and PK profile of intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of GSK1265744 in a long acting parenteral (LAP) formulation in healthy subjects. Subjects will be randomized to 3 monthly dosing cohorts and 1 quarterly dosing cohort with either intramuscular or subcutaneous dosing. In the monthly dosing cohorts subjects will receive GSK1265744 alone for 2 months and then in combination with TMC278 long acting parenteral (LA) for 2 months. For the quarterly dosing cohort 2 quarterly intramuscular doses of GSK1265744 LAP will be given alone. Three dose levels of GSK1265744 will be evaluated partly in combination with TMC278 LA to adequately characterize the GSK1265744 LAP and TMC278 LA safety tolerability and PK profile.

HIV,Evaluation of the Bioequivalence of a Combined Formulated Tablet, Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572) is a next-generation integrase inhibitor (INI) currently in phase 3 clinical trials for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) have greatly simplified the treatment of patients with HIV. While Atripla (an FDC of tenofovir (TDF) emtricitabine (FTC) and efavirenz (EFV)) has become the preferred first line regimen due in large part to its convenient presentation as a full treatment regimen in a single product other options are needed. A fixed-dose combination of DTG/abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) is one such opportunity. Part A of this study will be a single-dose two-treatment crossover pivotal bioequivalence (BE) evaluation of the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet in 66 healthy subjects. The reference formulations in this trial will be the 50 mg DTG tablet that is currently being used in the Phase 3 clinical trials and the already marketed FDC tablet product EPZICOM??(ABC 600 mg/3TC 300 mg).It is intended that the results of this pivotal bioequivalence study will show that the proposed commercial DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet formulation is bioequivalent to DTG plus EPZICOM administered as separate tablets. Part B of this study will evaluate the effect of a high fat meal on the FDC tablet in 12 healthy subjects that have already participated in Part A of the study. There will be a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug and a follow up visit within 7-14 days after the last dose. There will be a 7 day washout between doses in each treatment period. The following PK parameters for DTG ABC and 3TC will be measured: area under the concentration curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time (AUC(0-infinity)) Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC (0-t)) maximum observed concentration (Cmax) lag time before observation of drug concentrations (tlag) time of occurrence of Cmax (tmax) terminal phase half-life (tÂ½) terminal elimination phase rate constant (Î»z) percentage of AUC obtained by extrapolation (%AUCex)apparent clearance following oral dosing (CL/F) and apparent terminal phase volume    ,NCT01622790
HIV,Dose Ranging Study of GSK1265744 Plus Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors for Induction of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Virologic Suppression Followed by Virologic Suppression Maintenance by GSK1265744 Plus Rilpivirine, The study is designed to select a dose of GSK1265744 primarily on the basis of antiviral activity and tolerability in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral naive subjects. This study consists of two parts: Induction Phase: Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized (50 subjects in each of the 4 treatment arms). The Induction Phase consists of a 24 week dose-ranging evaluation of GSK1265744 at blinded doses of 10 mg 30 mg and 60 mg once-daily and a control arm of open-label efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg once daily. The background dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all arms will be either abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) as selected by the Investigator. Subjects randomized to a GSK1265744 containing arm who successfully complete 24 weeks on study and demonstrate virologic suppression (defined as having a plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid [RNA] <50 copies per milliliter [c/mL] before Week 24 with no signs of virologic rebound) will become eligible for the Maintenance Phase of this study. Maintenance Phase: The background NRTIs will be discontinued and the subjects will continue their randomized dose of GSK1265744 in combination with rilpivirine (RPV) 25 mg once-daily for an additional 72 weeks. The Maintenance phase will evaluate the ability of this two drug ART regimen to maintain virologic suppression through Week 48 Week 72 and Week 96. Subjects randomized to the EFV arm will continue on their randomized regimen through Week 96. After completion of the maintenance phase subjects could enroll in the Open-Label Phase to continue GSK1265744 + RPV treatment as long as they continue to derive clinical benefit and until it is locally approved and commercially available.    ,NCT01641809

HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Calcium Carbonate and Ferrous Fumarate on Pharmacokinetics of Dolutegravir in Healthy Adult Subjects, Human immune virus (HIV) infected subjects may take mineral supplements in combination with their antiretroviral medications. Calcium and Iron supplementations are commonly used and both of these have the potential to interact with Dolutegravir (DTG) this study will evaluate the potential of calcium and iron supplements to decrease DTG exposure. It will also evaluate two possible strategies for combined use; if an interaction is observed. The first strategy is a two hour separation. The second strategy involves the administration of DTG and the supplement with a meal since the presence of food modestly increases DTG exposure and because mineral supplements can be administered with food. This is an open label randomized two cohort four-period cross-over study in healthy volunteers. One cohort will examine the effects of calcium carbonate and the other cohort will examine the effects of ferrous fumarate on the pharmacokinetic (PK) of DTG. Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled into each of the two cohorts and receive each of four treatments in a randomized fashion: 1) A single dose of DTG 50 milligram (mg) administered under fasted conditions ; 2) A single dose of DTG 50 mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate under fasted conditions ; 3) A single dose of DTG 50 mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate with a moderate-fat meal; 4) A single dose of DTG 50 mg administered under fasted conditions 2 hours prior to administration of a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between treatments. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. This study will be conducted at one center in the United States with healthy adult male and female subjects.    ,NCT01762995

HIV,Open-label Study of Dolutegravir (DTG) or Efavirenz (EFV) for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) - Tuberculosis (TB) Co-infection, HIV/Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection have profound effects on the host's immune system. TB is the most common cause of death in patients with HIV worldwide. Rifamycins (such as rifampicin [RIF]) are an important component of TB therapy because of their unique activity. The problem is that most protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) used to treat HIV have significant drug-drug interactions with RIF that can lead to reduced concentrations of these agents with risk of treatment failure or resistance. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz (EFV) does not present the same significant drug interactions with RIF. EFV-based HIV treatment was tested in patients concomitantly treated with RIF-containing TB therapy demonstrating that their co-administration can be used safely and effectively. However the side effect profile of EFV overlaps with the RIF-containing TB regimens and makes the management of treatment toxicities very complex. Integrase inhibitors (INI) such as dolutegravir (DTG) may offer an important alternative to EFV-based therapy in TB coinfected patients. A Phase I drug-drug interaction study was conducted in healthy HIV-seronegative subjects and showed that DTG at 50 mg twice daily given together with RIF was well-tolerated and resulted in DTG concentrations similar to those of DTG 50 mg given once daily alone which is the recommended dose for INI-naive patients. Therefore ART regimens using DTG 50 mg twice daily may represent a new treatment option for TB-infected patients who require concurrent treatment for HIV infection. This is a Phase III b randomized open-label study describing the efficacy and safety of DTG and EFV-containing ART regimens in HIV/TB co-infected patients. This study is designed to assess the antiviral activity of DTG or efavirenz (EFV) ART-containing regimens through 48 weeks. A total of approximately 115 +/-5% subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to DTG (approximately 69 subjects) and EFV (approximately 46 subjects) respectively. This study will include a Screening Period a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to 48 weeks plus a 4-week extension) and a DTG Open-label extension (OLE). During the DTG OLE subjects will be supplied with DTG until it is locally approved and commercially available the subject no longer derives clinical benefit or the subject meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation which ever comes first.    ,NCT02178592
HIV,Bioavailability Study of a Dolutegravir Dispersible Tablet and Effect of Different Types of Water on the Dispersible Tablet in Healthy Volunteers, Dolutegravir (DTG) is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor approved in the United States Canada Australia and EU. A dispersible tablet has been developed for pediatric use as an alternative to the granule formulation already in development and the approved film-coated tablet. This is a single-center randomized open-label 5-way crossover study in healthy adult subjects. The study will evaluate the relative bioavailability of five dosing regimens: 20 mg DTG pediatric granules (Treatment A) and of DTG 20 mg dispersible tablets (DTG 20 mg DT) after dispersed in: low mineral content(LMC) water (Treatment B); dispersed in CONTREX??mineral water (Treatment C); dispersed in low mineral content water and consumed after standing for 30 minutes (Treatment D) and dispersed in CONTREX mineral water and consumed after standing for 30 minutes (Treatment E). Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug.

HIV,Comparative Efficacy and Safety Study of Dolutegravir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir in Second-line Treatment, For treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) publicly funded programmes tend to follow World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to use a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART); however there is a need for further data on the best treatment options for people with HIV-1 who have virological failure with this first-line regimen. The number of patients failing on their first-line regimen is increasing thereby requiring a switch to second-line treatment to reduce accumulation of drug-resistance mutations disease progression HIV transmission and death. WHO guidelines recommend second-line antiretroviral therapy for adults consisting of two NRTIs + a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI); atazanavir (ATV) plus ritonavir (RTV) or lopinavir (LPV)/RTV are the preferred boosted PI options. This study is conducted to demonstrate non-inferior antiviral activity at 48 weeks of a dolutegravir (DTG) containing regimen compared to a WHO-recommended standard of care regimen for second line treatment LPV/RTV + two NRTIs in HIV-1 infected patients failing first line therapy. This study comprises of a Screening Phase (approximately 28 to 42 days) a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to Week 48 plus a 4-week treatment extension) and a Continuation Phase. Approximately 612 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 milligram (mg) once daily or LPV/RTV (800/200 mg once daily or 400/100 mg twice daily in accordance with investigator decision and local label) each added to an investigator selected background regimen of two NRTIs at least one of which needs to be fully active based on viral resistance testing at Screening. Subjects randomized to receive DTG who successfully complete 52 weeks of treatment will continue to have access to DTG until it is either locally approved and commercial supplies are available to patients or the patient no longer derives clinical benefit or the patient meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation.    ,NCT02227238

HIV,Pharmacokinetics Study of GSK1265744 in Subjects With Severe Renal Impairment, GSK1265744 (744) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) currently in development for both the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Renal elimination of unchanged 744 is extremely low with no parent 744 detected in the urine after a single 30 mg radiolabeled dose. Despite the minimal contribution of renal clearance on overall 744 elimination renal impairment may potentially inhibit some pathways of hepatic and gut drug metabolism and transport and as a result may impact 744 pharmacokinetics. The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for renal impairment studies suggests that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in patients with renal impairment be conducted even for those drugs primarily metabolized or secreted in bile. The study will be comprised of two cohorts (severe renal impairment and normal renal function) of 8 subjects each. Upon enrolment each subject will be admitted to the study center and undergo serial PK sampling following a single dose of oral 744 30 milligrams (mg). Subjects will return to the clinic for follow-up evaluations 10-14 days after the 744 30 mg dose.    ,NCT02354937

After Week 148 subjects may be eligible to continue to receive DTG +RPV in the Continuation Phase. The study is planned to be conducted in approximately 476 participants.    ,NCT02429791
HIV,Pharmacokinetic Study of Cabotegravir Long-acting in Healthy Adult Volunteers, Cabotegravir (CAB) long-acting (LA) is a promising candidate for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) due to its potent antiretroviral activity and infrequent dosing requirements. Currently the CAB concentrations achieved in the anatomical sites associated with sexual HIV transmission following the proposed 600 milligram (mg) intramuscular (IM) PrEP dose are unknown. These data will enhance our understanding of CAB distribution to the anatomical mucosal tissue believed to be relevant to sexual HIV-1 transmission and supplement the data to support future PrEP clinical trial development. The primary objective is to determine the PK concentrations of CAB following LA administration in plasma and in vaginal tissue (VT) cervical tissue (CT) and cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) in healthy women and in rectal tissue (RT) and rectal fluid (RF) in healthy men and women following a single 600 mg IM dose. This will be a Phase 1 open label study in healthy subjects to assess the pharmacokinetics of CAB LA in the plasma and mucosal locations associated with sexual HIV-1 transmission: vaginal tissue cervical tissue cervicovaginal fluid rectal tissue and rectal fluid. The study will consist of a screening period a 28-day oral lead-in phase at a dose of 30 mg per day followed by a 14-21 day washout period and a single dose of CAB LA 600 mg as an IM (intragluteal) injection with compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling for up to 12 weeks. Subjects will return for safety assessments and plasma PK sampling at Week 24 and Week 36 post-injection and undergo a follow-up/withdrawal visit at Week 52 post-injection    ,NCT02478463
HIV,Bone Mineral Density in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1)-Infected Adult Subjects Switching From a Tenofovir Regimen to a Dolutegravir Plus Rilpivirine Regimen, The purpose of this study is to evaluate any change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) in subjects following the switch from a triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen containing Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) - sparing two - drug regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) + rilpivirine (RPV) in subjects participating in the parent studies 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2). This open-label parallel group study is a sub-study which will recruit subjects who are receiving ART regimens which include TDF at the time of randomization to receive treatment in one of two identical parent studies 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2). These are Phase III randomised open-label multicentre parallel-group non-inferiority studies evaluating the efficacy safety and tolerability of switching to DTG plus RPV from current integrase inhibitor (INI)- non NNRTI- or protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral regimen in HIV-1-infected adults who are virologically suppressed having HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels <50 copies per millilitre (c/mL). Randomisation in the parent studies will be stratified by baseline third agent class (INI NNRTI or PI) age group (< or =>50 years old) and participation in this Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) sub-study therefore there will also be balance across the treatment arms in this sub-study both overall and with respect to baseline third agent class and age at entry. The study population will include approximately 75 evaluable subjects recruited from the Early Switch DTG + RPV treatment group of the parent studies 201636 and 201637 and approximately 75 evaluable subjects from the Late Switch group who continue their current antiretroviral therapy (CAR) through to Week 52 across both the 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2) studies. Subjects participating in study 202094 will have DEXA scans performed at Day 1 and at study Weeks 48 100 and 148 in parallel with the corresponding scheduled visits in the parent studies.    ,NCT02478632
HIV,Pharmacokinetics Safety and Tolerability Study of Abacavir/ Dolutegravir/ Lamivudine Fixed-dose Combination Tablets in Healthy Japanese Subjects, The abacavir (ABC)/dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC) 600 milligrams (mg)/50 mg/300 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet is currently approved in the United States (US) and Europe. Although the pharmacokinetics (PK) safety and tolerability of ABC/DTG/3TC FDC tablets have been extensively studied in subjects not of Japanese heritage these parameters have not been exclusively assessed in Japanese subjects. To support the marketing application in Japan this single-dose open-label study will characterize the PK safety and tolerability of ABC/DTG/3TC FDC tablet in adult Japanese healthy subjects. A maximum of 12 subjects will be enrolled such that approximately 10 evaluable subjects complete the study. The study will consist of a screening treatment phase (single oral dose under the fasted state) and follow-up visit (within 7-14 days of the last PK sample collected). The total duration of the study for each subject will be approximately up to 48 days.    ,NCT02539576

HIV,Relative Bio-availability Study of Dolutegravir and Lamivudine Fixed Dose Combinations, Dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine (3TC) are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets of existing approved drugs are preferred by many patients and offer the potential for increased patient adherence and consequently a reduced likelihood of virological failure and viral resistance. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of two experimental FDC tablets of DTG and 3TC relative to co-administration of the single entity products in healthy adult subjects. This study will be conducted as a randomized open label three-way crossover design with 6 treatment sequences in approximately 30 subjects. Each subject will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug three treatment periods each with a single dose of study drug and a follow-up visit within 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. There will be at least 7 days washout between dosing periods. The total duration of participation of a subject in this study will be approximately 9 weeks.    ,NCT02738931
HIV,Bioequivalence Study of a Fixed-dose Combination (FDC) of Dolutegravir (DTG) and Rilpivirine (RPV), The purpose of the study is to evaluate the bioequivalence between Fixed-dose Combination (FDC) tablet formulation of Dolutegravir (DTG) 50 milligrams (mg) and Rilpivirine (RPV) 25 mg versus co-administration of the separate tablet formulations of DTG 50 mg plus RPV 25 mg in the fed state. This pivotal bioequivalence study is to serve as a pharmacokinetic (PK) bridge to the ongoing Phase 3 trials with the separate agents. This study will be conducted under fed conditions to appropriately mimic the conditions in the Phase 3 trials. This is a single-center randomized open-label 2-period single-dose crossover study. A minimum of 86 healthy adult subjects will be randomized such that a minimum of approximately 82 evaluable subjects complete the study. The total duration of participation of a subject in this study will be approximately 8 weeks which includes a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug two treatment periods each with a single dose of study drug and a follow-up visit within 12-17 days after the last dose of study drug. There will be a washout of at least 21 days between each dose of study drug. A blinded (for treatment) review of DTG and RPV plasma concentration data for approximately the first 40 subjects will be conducted. If the within-subject coefficients of variation (CVw%) for either DTG or RPV maximal drug concentration (Cmax) values are >=31%; a sample size re-estimation will be employed and additional subjects (beyond the 86 planned) will be randomized for treatment in the study. Following the re-estimation it is possible that up to approximately 154 healthy adult subjects (68 new subjects in addition to the planned 86 subjects above) will be randomized such that a maximum of approximately 146 evaluable subjects could complete the study.    ,NCT02741557

HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Effect of High Fat Meal on Cabotegravir, Cabotegravir is being developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 infection. Specifically it is being developed as a component of a 2-drug maintenance regimen (post-induction of viral suppression) that includes rilpivirine. Rilpivirine requires food for optimal absorption; therefore the recommended intake of cabotegravir in the planned Phase 3 treatment studies is with food regardless of fat or calorie content when administered along with rilpivirine. This is a single-center randomized open-label two-way crossover study in healthy adult subjects to assess the effect of a high fat meal on the single dose pharmacokinetics of CAB 30 mg. Approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled in the study and will be screened for 30 days. Twelve subjects with at least 10 hours of fasting will be randomized to receive a single dose of cabotegravir orally (Schedule 'A'). The remaining 12 subjects will receive a single dose of cabotegravir orally along with high fat meal (Schedule 'B'). After 15 days the subjects earlier undergoing 'Schedule A' will be switched to 'Schedule B' and those undergoing 'Schedule B' will undergo 'Schedule A'. All the subjects will be followed up to 30 days from the day of receiving first dose of cabotegravir to evaluate the effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir.    ,NCT02799264

HIV,Study to Evaluate the Efficacy Safety and Tolerability of Long-acting Intramuscular Cabotegravir and Rilpivirine for Maintenance of Virologic Suppression Following Switch From an Integrase Inhibitor in HIV-1 Infected Therapy Naive Participants, The First Long-Acting Injectable Regimen (FLAIR) study is being conducted to establish if human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infected adult participants whose virus is virologically suppressed on an integrase inhibitor single tablet regimen (INI STR) will remain suppressed after switching to a two-drug intramuscular (IM) long-acting (LA) regimen of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV). In this study the INI STR will be limited to abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (ABC/DTG/3TC). FLAIR is a Phase 3 multi-phase randomized open label active-controlled multicenter parallel-group non-inferiority study in HIV-1 anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-naÃ¯ve adult participants. This study is designed to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to a two drug CAB LA 400 mg + RPV LA 600 mg regimen every 4 weeks (Q4W: monthly) compared to remaining on ABC/DTG/3TC over 48 weeks (4 weeks oral CAB + RPV 44 weeks LA therapy). Participants who are HLA-B*5701 positive at Screening may enroll into the study and receive DTG plus a non-abacavir containing dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) regimen. Eligible particpants will enroll into the Induction Phase of the study and receive ABC/DTG/3TC for 20 weeks (Week [-20] to Day 1). Participants who have an HIV 1 ribose nucleic acid (RNA) <50 copies per milliliter (c/mL) at Week (-4) will be randomized (1:1) into the Maintenance Phase at Day 1 to either continue ABC/DTG/3TC or to discontinue ABC/DTG/3TC and begin oral therapy with CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg once daily for approximately 4 Weeks followed by monthly CAB LA + RPV LA injections from visit Week 4b until study completion or withdrawal. At the end of the Maintenance phase eligible participants who were randomized to continue ABC/DTG/3TC will be given an option to switch to LA therapy at Week 100. Those participants (HIV 1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 96) will transition to LA dosing beginning with approximately 4 weeks oral CAB + RPV therapy at Week 100 and receive the first IM CAB LA + RPV LA injections at Week 104b. Participants will continue to receive injections every 4 weeks during the Extension Phase until CAB LA and RPV LA are either locally approved and commercially available the participant no longer derives clinical benefit the participant meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation or until development of either CAB LA or RPV LA is terminated.    ,NCT02938520

HIV,PH3b DTG Study in HIV-1 Subjects Completing IMPAACT Study P1093, Dolutegravir (DTG) is a potent inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase that has been developed for the treatment of HIV. This is a phase 3b (PH3b) non-randomized open-label multi-center treatment rollover study. The primary objective of this pediatric interventional study is to provide continued access to DTG for eligible participants who previously participated in the international maternal pediatric adolescent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] clinical trials (IMPAACT) P1093 study (parent study) and who cannot locally access DTG in the public sector. The P1093 study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) safety tolerability and antiviral activity of DTG in HIV-1 experienced adolescents and children as well as treatment-naive infants and toddlers. Participants who have no evidence of virological failure (VF) and who have tolerated DTG in the parent study without any significant toxicity leading to the permanent discontinuation of this drug and withdrawal from the parent study will be considered for this open-label continued access study. Participants will be receiving their age/weight appropriate dose of DTG as defined in the parent study. The objective of this study will be supported through evaluation of serious adverse events. The duration of participant accrual into the study will extend until DTG receives local (by country) regulatory approval . Therefore participants enrolled into this study will be those who will benefit from treatment and will continue to receive DTG until local (by country) regulatory approval and commercial or other availability occurs from another source (e.g. government programs aid programs assistance programs etc.). Participants will be enrolled after all screening procedures have been completed. In most cases the Screening visit will overlap with the participant's penultimate visit on the parent study (at Week 180 of P1093). Participants who meet all entry criteria may enroll and will be seen in the clinic every 12 weeks for a safety evaluation and to receive DTG. It is estimated that no more than 120 participants will be enrolled in this study.    ,NCT03016533

The objectives of the study are to demonstrate 1) non-inferior antiviral activity of fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400mg/100mg QD compared to fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700mg/100mg BID and 2) a superior fasting non-HDL lipid profile in subjects receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400mg/100mg QD.    ,NCT00450580
HIV,Prospective Epidemiological Study Of The Prevalence Of HLA-B*5701 In HIV-1 Infected Patients, This study is a cross-sectional observational study to evaluate the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 in the European area and in major European ethnotypes. Any HIV-1 infected patient will be eligible for this study including treatment naÃ¯ve and experienced patients as well as patients previously tested for HLA-B*5701. Patients will be approached during a standard clinic visit and will be consented prior to any study specific procedure. They will be asked to provide a tissue sample (cheek cells and blood sample) which will be used to assess HLA-B*5701 status by local and central laboratories. In selected sites patients may be asked to provide an additional blood sample. This sample will be used to develop and validate different methodologies for assessing HLA-B*5701 status.    ,NCT00481390
HIV,KIVEXA Vs TRUVADA Both Administered With Efavirenz In ART-Naive Subjects, Recently the fixed-dose combinations (FDC) KIVEXA??(abacavir/lamivudine) and TRUVADA (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine) have facilitated the usage of once-daily regimens. However data from head-to-head randomized trials comparing these two FDCs as part of an initial regimen are not available at present. The long-term toxicity profiles of these regimens are of particular importance as treatment of HIV is currently life-long and therefore minimizing long-term toxicity and maximizing adherence and duration of regimen maintenance are critical therapy objectives. The primary endpoint is estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as measured by the modified diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation a validated estimate of renal function.    ,NCT00549198

HIV,A Study to Evaluate the Bioequivalence of a Combined Formulated Tablet Compared With Maraviroc and Combivir?? This is a study in healthy adult subjects to evaluate the bioequivalence of a Combined Formulated Tablet compared with maraviroc and Combivir administered concurrently versus maraviroc + Combivir. 42 subjects will be enrolled in the study such that 40 subjects complete dosing and critical assessments. The total duration of a subject's participation will be approximately 33 to 35 days including a screening period (Day ??1 to Day ??) 2 treatment periods (Days 1-3) at least a 7-day washout between Period 1 and Period 2 and a follow-up visit 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug in Period 2. Each dosing period will begin the evening prior to dosing and extend until 48 hours (Day 3) after dosing. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following 2 treatments in Period 1 then crossover to receive the alternate treatment in Period 2: In Sequence 1 (N=21) subjects will receive Treatment A followed by a 7 day washout and Treatment B. In Sequence 2 (N=21) subjects will receive Treatment B followed by a 7 day washout and Treatment A. Treatment A consists of 1 tablet of maraviroc 300 mg lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg as a combined formulation after an overnight fast. Treatment B consists of 1 tablet of maraviroc 300 mg + 1 tablet of Combivir taken concurrently after an overnight fast. On Day 1 of each treatment period subjects will receive study drug in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Study drug will be administered with 240 mL of water. Dosing in each treatment period will be separated by a minimum washout period of at least 7 days between doses. All subjects will undergo safety and other assessments. Subjects may be discharged after all study procedures are completed on the morning of Day 3 with instructions to return for the next study period or the follow-up visit as appropriate. The follow-up visit will occur 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug in Period 2.

HIV,Methadone-Dolutegravir (DTG - GSK1349572) Drug Interaction Study., Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of HIV infection. As HIV-infected subjects may also be receiving methadone for opioid dependence an evaluation of the potential interaction between DTG and methadone is warranted. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether concomitant administration of DTG can affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of methadone. As a secondary endpoint the PK of DTG will be compared to historical data. This study will be open-label with subjects receiving DTG and stable doses of methadone. The study will be conducted at one center in Canada in adult male and female subjects.    ,NCT01467518

HIV,Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of an Oral Contraceptive Containing Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol When Co-administered With GSK1265744 in Healthy Adult Female Subjects, This open-label fixed-sequence crossover study aims to evaluate the effect of GSK1265744 (744) oral administration on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a commonly used oral contraceptive (OC) product (combination of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel) in 20 healthy female subjects. Each subject will participate in a Run-in Period (if needed) followed by a single-sequence Treatment Period. Subjects will receive oral contraceptive containing Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol on Days 1 to 21 and be OC free on Days 22 to 28 during which withdrawal menses should occur. Subjects will receive OC alone on Days 1 to 10. Levonorgestrel (LNG) and ethinyl estradiol (EE) PK will be determined on Day 10. Subjects will then co-administer 744 and OC on Days 11 to 21. Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol PK will be determined again on Day 21 to assess if co-administration with 744 results in a significant change in OC exposure compared to OC alone. Subjects will return to the study center for final follow-up evaluations 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study medication (Days 28 to 35).    ,NCT02159131
HIV,GSK1349572 Drug Interaction Study With Efavirenz, GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of HIV infection. As GSK1349572 development progresses it may be dosed with non-nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) including efavirenz (EFV Sustiva). Efavirenz is a known inducer of CYP3A4. GSK1349572 is primarily metabolized via UGT1A1 however it also has a CYP component to its metabolism thus a drug interaction between GSK1349572 and EFV is likely. A previous study showed that another NNRTI etravirine which is also a known inducer of CYP3A and UGT reduced GSK1349572 exposure significantly. GSK1349572 is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A and is not expected to have impact on pharmacokinetics (PK) of EFV. This study will investigate the dose proportionality between single doses of 50mg and 100mg of GSK1349572 and will compare steady-state plasma PK safety and tolerability of GSK1349572 50 mg every 24h (q24h) with and without efavirenz 600 mg q24h. Approximately 12 subjects will receive a single dose of GSK1349572 100 mg (Treatment A) in Period 1 followed by a washout of greater than or equal to 6 days. In Period 2 subjects will receive GSK1349572 50mg q24h for 5 days (Treatment B). Subjects will then be administered GSK1349572 50mg q24h in the morning in combination with EFV 600 mg q24h (Treatment C) in the evening for 14 days in Period 3. There will be no washout between Periods 2 and 3. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples for GSK1349572 will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. This study will be conducted at one center in the US with healthy adult male and female subjects.    ,NCT01098526
HIV,GSK1349572 Drug Interaction Study With Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir, GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on behalf of Shionogi-ViiV HealthcareLLC. In HIV-infected patients where combination antiretroviral therapy is the standard of care it is likely that it will be dosed with boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) including fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/RTV or FPV/r). As FPV and RTV are modulators (induction as well as inhibition) of Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and Cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A which are the primary and secondary metabolic pathways of GKS1349572 it is likely that FPV/RTV will affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK1349572 therefore a drug interaction study is warranted and will be evaluated in Part A of this study. Part B will evaluate the effect of particle size of tablet variants on the PK of GSK1349572. In Part A approximately 12 subjects will receive GSK1349572 50mg every 24 hours (q24h) for 5 days (Treatment A). Subjects will then be administered GSK1349572 50mg q24h in combination with FPV/RTV 700/100 mg every 12 hours (q12h) (Treatment B) for 10 days. There will be no washout between treatments. In Part B 15 subjects will receive a single 50 mg dose (2 x 25mg tablet) in 3 different tablet variants of the same formulation differing only in particle sizes of GSK1349572 under fasted conditions in a three-way crossover design. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug.    ,NCT01209065

HIV,Relative Bioavailability Study of a Pediatric Granule Formulation of Dolutegravir, Dolutegravir (DTG GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor currently in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A granule formulation has been developed as an alternative to the current tablet formulation for administration in pediatric populations. This is a single-center randomized open-label 5-way crossover study in healthy adult subjects. The study will evaluate the relative bioavailability of a 50 mg granule formulation of dolutegravir when administered 1) directly to mouth; 2) with purified water; 3) with Contrex brand water; and 4) with milk-based infant formula compared to the current 50 mg tablet formulation administered with tap water. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A taste assessment of the granule will also be performed. A follow-up visit will occur 5-7 days after the last dose of study drug. Pharmacokinetic assessments during the study will include area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time (AUC(0-infinity)) area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to last time of quantifiable concentration within a subject across all treatments (AUC(0-t)) maximum observed concentration (Cmax) terminal phase half-life (tÂ½) lag time before observation of drug concentrations in sampled matrix (tlag) time of occurrence of Cmax (tmax) concentration at 24 hours post-dose (C24) and apparent clearance following oral dosing (CL/F).    ,NCT01382238

HIV,A Feasibility Study of Co-administering Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) and R-EPOCH Chemotherapy for the Management of ARL, No standard regimen currently exists for the treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma. Based on the encouraging NCI results with DA-EPOCH the US AIDS Malignancy Consortium is currently administering a phase II randomized protocol comparing EPOCH with sequential versus concurrent rituximab (AMC protocol 034). In this AMC trial the decision to co-administer cART is left to the discretion of the treating physician and the patient. While the AMC phase II study may establish an acceptable chemotherapy regimen suitable for further study in a phase III randomized trial the results will not address adherence pharmacokinetic interactions or the role of cART in AIDS-related lymphoma. The contribution of cART to the anti-lymphoma efficacy of any regimen needs to be formally studied. Our proposed trial to demonstrate the feasibility of co-administering cART with chemotherapy would justify the use of combined therapy in future AMC/International phase III protocols.    ,NCT00799136
HIV,EPOCH and Rituximab to Treat Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in Patients With HIV Infection, Background:   -  HIV-infected patients have a weakened immune system and chemotherapy which is used to treat lymphoma probably causes further damage to the immune system.   -  Limiting the amount of immune damage due to chemotherapy might decrease the number of infections and the risk of developing cancer in the future in HIV-infected patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Objectives:   -  To determine whether reducing the total amount of chemotherapy using a specific combination of drugs called EPOCH-R (etoposide doxorubicin vincristine cyclophosphamide and rituximab) will rid the body of lymphoma quickly while decreasing the risk of infections and future cancers.   -  To determine whether the lymphoma will remain undetectable for at least one year if treatment is stopped one cycle after the patient enters remission. Eligibility: -Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and HIV infection 4 years of age and older who have not been treated previously with rituximab or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Design:   -  Patients receive EPOCH-R in 3-week treatment cycles for at least three and no more than six cycles.   -  The lymphoma is evaluated using CT and PET scans at the end of treatment cycles 2 and 3. A bone marrow biopsy is repeated after cycle 2 if a biopsy was initially positive on screening for participation in the study.   -  Anti-HIV therapy is stopped before chemotherapy begins and is restarted when EPOCH-R treatment ends.   -  Patients are monitored for treatment response with blood tests and imaging scans at baseline when treatment ends 2 months after treatment ends and then every 3 to 6 months for a total of 24 months following chemotherapy.    ,NCT00006436
HIV,Chemotherapy and HAART to Treat AIDS-related Primary Brain Lymphoma," This study will investigate the use of chemotherapy plus highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients with AIDS-related primary brain lymphoma. None of the drugs used in this study are experimental but chemotherapy plus HAART has not been established as a standard treatment in patients with AIDS. The chemotherapy regimen used in this study (see below) was chosen because it may be less toxic to immune cells called T-lymphocytes than most drug treatments for lymphoma. People with AIDS 18 and older and have primary brain lymphoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination MRI CT and PET scans cerebrospinal fluid studies brain biopsy at tumor sites if possible electrocardiogram and blood tests. Participants undergo six 2-week ""induction treatment"" cycles of HAART plus chemotherapy with methotrexate rituximab and leucovorin followed by two 4-week ""consolidation"" treatment cycles using HAART methotrexate and leucovorin and then HAART alone. Rituximab is given by intravenous (IV through a vein) day 1 of each cycle. Also on day 1 IV fluids are given to lower acidity in the urine to protect the kidneys from the methotrexate. On day 2 methotrexate is infused through a vein over 4 hours. Starting 24 hours after initiation of the methotrexate infusion leucovorin is given every 3 to 6 hours (first IV and then possibly by mouth) until the drug decreases to a target level in the blood. HAART is begun as soon as possible. The specific HAART regimen for each patient is determined individually. All patients are hospitalized the first week of every 2-week treatment cycle for safety monitoring. In addition to HAART and chemotherapy patients undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  Intellectual functioning: Before starting treatment patients are tested for their ability to understand basic concepts and coordination in order to be able to evaluate how the brain lymphoma affects thinking and concentration. After the lymphoma appears to have resolved more formal and intensive tests are done. The intensive tests are repeated each year and shorter interim tests are done about every 6 months. Also a specialist periodically monitors patients' understanding of HAART and the importance of this therapy.   -  Blood tests: Blood is drawn every day during hospitalizations to measure methotrexate levels and to evaluate kidney and liver function and blood counts. Blood is also drawn before starting therapy when the lymphoma disappears 6 months after completing treatment and any time it appears that the lymphoma may have recurred to test for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) a virus that is almost always present in AIDS-related primary brain lymphoma.   -  Imaging tests: Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans periodically to monitor the effects of treatment on the lymphoma. MRI scans are done after the 2nd 4th 6th and 8th treatments then every 2 months for three times every 3 months for six times every 6 months for four times and then every year for 5 years or sooner if there is a concern about the brain. PET scans are done after the first cycle after the MRI suggests the lymphoma is gone and then yearly.   -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This test is done to look for EBV in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Under local anesthetic a needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord and a small amount of fluid is collected through the needle. This test is done at the same times as the blood tests for EBV.   -  Eye examinations: Patients' eyes are examined periodically because brain lymphoma can sometimes spread to the eye and because some people with AIDS-related primary brain lymphoma are at risk of certain eye infections.

HIV,Assessment of CMV-specific ELISPOT Assay for Predicting CMV Co-infection in Patients With Pneumocystitis Pneumonia (ACE-PCP), PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) is one of the important opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients including HIV-infected patients transplant recipients and immunosuppressant users. About one third of non-HIV patients with PCP have the evidence of co-infection with CMV. In this difficult clinical situation physicians have difficulty to decide on whether anti-CMV treament will help patients with any evidence of CMV co-infection. However there is no objective test to differentiate true co-infection of CMV from innocent bystander of CMV in those with PCP. The investigators thus evaluate the usefulness of CMV-specific ELISPOT assay in patients with PCP to differentiate true co-infection of CMV from inocent bystander of CMV. This findings may guide physicians to decide anti-CMV treatment in patients with PCP and CMV co-infection.    ,NCT02109887
HIV,Utilizing Computed Tomographic Angiography to Evaluate Coronary Artery Disease in Patients on Long-Term Antiretroviral Therapy, Utilizing Computed Tomographic Angiography to Evaluate Coronary Artery Disease in Patients on Long-Term Antiretroviral Therapy Intro: It is well known that HIV treated with antiretroviral drugs increases the risk for coronary artery disease. Studies have documented this with various methods including analyzing the effects of retroviral therapy on cardiac risk factors such as diabetes lipids and hypertension. Still other studies have looked at carotid and brachial artery intimal thickness. Our study then aims to evaluate the relationship between HIV medications and coronary atherosclerosis using a novel method. Coronary artery CT angiography is a relatively new diagnostic procedure to evaluate heart disease in cardiac patients. We will apply this test to HIV patients on longstanding antiretroviral therapy to directly examine their coronary arteries to assess heart disease. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy will have increased coronary artery disease compared to the general population. Methods: This project will be conducted in collaboration between Florida Heart Center and Associates in infectious Disease - two communities based infectious disease and cardiology practices. We will identify all the HIV positive patients seen within a 1 month timeframe at the infectious disease office. These patients will then be filtered by our exclusion/inclusion criteria. After obtaining informed consent we will draw blood from each patient to gather lab values such as A1C cholesterol inflammatory markers and other markers associated with coronary artery disease. Each enrolled patient will then schedule and receive a 64 slide coronary CTA at Florida Heart Center. The results of the CTA scans will be categorized in mild moderate and severe coronary artery disease. The data then will consist of the parameters measured on blood work and the results of the coronary CTA. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Patients aged 35 to 50 with HIV and on retroviral therapy for at least 5 years. Exclusion Criteria: 1. Patients with prior documented coronary artery disease heart attack stent placement or heart surgery. Statistical Analysis: We will conduct a multivariate analysis on the cardiac risk factors taken from patient history and the bloodwork (diabetes lipids etc) to correlate them with the results of the CTA. We will also conduct basic analysis to support our hypothesis that long term antiretroviral therapy increases coronary artery disease. Funding: The bloodwork and CTA tests ordered in this study will be payed for by insurance companies where available. In cases where insurance companies will not pay Florida Heart Center will pay for the CTA tests and Associates in infectious Disease will fund the bloodwork. Humans Subjects Protection: This will be a projective chart review study that will require access to protected health information. Thus we will seek full IRB approval from the FSU IRB committee with informed consent. An informed consent document will be given to each patient explaining all the risks and benefits of the study in addition to the methods. Recruitment will be done by an office staff or medical assistant not on the research team. After patient recruitment their medical records will be flagged for study and they will undergo the required testing. At completion of testing their results will be recorded in the final data sheet and their medical record will no longer be flagged for study. No identifying data will be recorded in the final data sheet and the data will be stored in an encrypted excel sheet on a secure password protected personal laptop running antivirus and firewall. Third parties (such as family members) will not have access to any research data regardless of authorizations received from the study subjects. All the test results and labwork performed for the study will go into the patient's individual medical record at their respective offices. Thus if an authorized third party wishes to view any test results they can do so via the normal methods at the doctor's office.    ,NCT02191306
HIV,Pediatric HIV Disclosure Intervention, With increased availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and improved care increasing numbers of perinatally infected children are surviving into adolescence. While HIV care and treatment programs are expanding growing challenge faced by health providers and caregivers is diagnosis disclosure to HIV infected children. The investigators propose a 4 year project to test the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioural intervention that the investigators have designed to support developmentally appropriate disclosure to HIV infected children by their caregiver. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will lead to increased disclosure rates and will over time improve health and mental health outcomes among caregivers and children in the intervention group compared to those receiving standard care. The findings of the study will inform Ugandan and other countries' national policies on pediatric HIV care and treatment.    ,NCT01773642
HIV,Couple-oriented Prenatal HIV Counseling in Low and Medium HIV Prevalence Countries, ANRS 12127 Prenahtest is an intervention trial conducted in four countries (Cameroon Dominican Republic Georgia and India) where pregnant women are randomized during prenatal care to receive either standard post-test HIV counseling or an innovative intervention called couple-oriented post-test HIV counseling (COC). The aim of the COC intervention is to empower women to communicate with her male partner about HIV and HIV testing in particular and encourage him to return for HIV testing and/or couple HIV counseling (where both couple members are counseled together). Prenahtest is the first randomised trial testing a prenatal intervention to increase partner HIV testing.    ,NCT01494961

HIV,Equivalence of Boosted Atazanavir Based Regimens and Currently Effective HAART Regimens, The hypothesis for this study is will a treatment regimen containing Atazanavir in combination with Ritonavir work as well as other regimens containing a protease inhibitor (PI one of 5 classes of HIV Medications) and/or a Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI another of the classes of HIV medications) at controlling HIV disease in children who are HIV+ and have high cholesterol or high triglycerides. . In this study children who have high cholesterol or high triglycerides as a result of their HIV medicines will have the PI or NNRTI in their medication regimen changed to Atazanavir which is a PI in combination with a low dose of Ritonavir (another PI). Atazanavir has been shown in adults to result in lower cholesterol and triglycerides than other PI's and NNRTI's. The dose of atazanavir and ritonavir will be according to the Package Insert for this drug that is FDA approved for children. They will continue taking the other medications from the pre-study regimen. Children will take study drug for 24 weeks and will be able to continue study drug after the study using commercially available drug. Lab tests and a physical exam will be undertaken at 4 weeks 12 weeks and 24 weeks after starting study drug to determine how effective the new drug is and to monitor for possible side effects.    ,NCT00940771

HIV,Effectiveness of an HIV-adapted IMCI Training and Supervision Programme for Community Health Workers, This is a cluster randomized controlled trial (C-RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a Community-Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (C-IMCI) training for community caregivers (CCGs) adapted to include HIV-related interventions on the delivery of maternal newborn and child health interventions within households in rural communities in Ugu District KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province South Africa. The intervention includes two components: (1) a 2-week HIV/C-IMCI training for CCGs and their associated facilitators and supervisors and (2) continuous support and supervision following the continuous quality improvement (CQI) framework a low-technology approach to management and supervision of health programs. The primary objectives of the proposed evaluation are to measure the effect of the intervention on key outcomes including early uptake of antenatal care facility based delivery postnatal visits coverage of exclusive breastfeeding and uptake of HIV PCR testing in infants at 6 weeks. We will also examine the effects of the intervention on immunization uptake up to 12 months and knowledge and practices of CCGs and mothers pertaining to maternal newborn and child health.    ,NCT01774136
HIV,Primary HIV Prevention in Pregnant and Lactating Ugandan Women, This study aims to test the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention aimed at preventing the primary acquisition of HIV by uninfected pregnant and lactating women in Uganda East Africa where HIV transmission is high. Women who acquire HIV during pregnancy or lactation are at higher risk of adverse health and pregnancy outcomes and their baby is at high risk of acquiring HIV and dying. Keeping HIV-uninfected women uninfected during pregnancy and lactation is an important component of the global World Health Organization (WHO) strategy to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV but there has been no study to date to assess interventions that can effectively keep these women uninfected. In this study the investigators will test the hypotheses that:   1. extended repeat HIV testing and enhanced counseling (ERHTEC) during late pregnancy (>36 weeks) and breastfeeding can increase and sustain risk reduction behaviors and prevent incident STI and HIV infections among HIV-uninfected pregnant women and   2. that couple HIV testing and counseling (HTC) can further enhance this effect through improved couple communication and emotional and economic support from male partners.    ,NCT01882998

HIV,Reducing Heavy Drinking to Optimize HIV/AIDS Treatment and Prevention, This is a double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of Naltrexone (NTX) and counseling on highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) medication adherence in a cohort of HIV-infected patients who report heavy drinking or meet criteria for alcohol abuse and/or dependence and inadequate (< 95%) HAART adherence. All patients will receive a behavioral intervention termed Medical Management/Medication Coaching or MM/MC. MM/MC incorporates the behavioral platform Medical Management (MM) from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)-funded COMBINE Study to reduce heavy alcohol use with Medication Coaching (MC) a manualized treatment designed to improve HAART medication adherence in HIV-infected patients with substance use disorders.    ,NCT01227044
HIV,Impact of a Raltegravir-based Regimen on Early Mortality of Severely Immunocompromised AIDS Patients, The current available antiretroviral (ARV) agents make possible a successful treatment of virtually all HIV-infected patients but some problems related to early mortality are still of concern mainly in resources-limited settings. There are several published reports showing that such patients are at a significantly higher risk of death during the first months of treatment in comparison with the observed outcomes in developed countries. One of the consistently detected risks for early mortality across these reports is the baseline low CD4 count although it does not seem to be the only reason for such outcome. In Brazil and other developing countries there is still a large proportion of AIDS patients who are diagnosed with AIDS or only seek health care for HIV infection late in the course of disease. Raltegravir (RAL) the first HIV-1 integrase inhibitor is a potent and safe ARV drug. The available evidence suggest it promotes a faster decline in HIV-1 plasma viremia and a higher increase in CD4 cells count in comparison with those in Efavirenz (EFV) arm. The investigators propose to compare the impact of RAL versus EFV in the early mortality rates for severely ill (CD4+ cells count <50 cells/mm3) patients starting ARV therapy.    ,NCT01837277

HIV,Improving Identification of Social Harm Among Substance Abusers in HIV Trials, This two-phased project will develop a comprehensive audio computer assisted self-administered interview social harm questionnaire (ACASI-SHQ) that will allow researchers to more easily identify and monitor social harms experienced by substance abusers participating in HIV-related trials. The ACASI-SHQ will (1) reduce the likelihood of socially desirable responding (2) include items with high levels of specificity to increase the likelihood of identifying social harms (construct validity) and (3) utilize a self-interview format that will increase the likelihood of its adoption by HIV researchers. The investigators will then evaluate its feasibility acceptability and preliminary utility and construct validity in an ongoing HIV-related trial.    ,NCT02148276
HIV,Safety Tolerability & Efficacy on LDL-C of Evolocumab in Subjects With HIV & Hyperlipidemia/Mixed Dyslipidemia, The study is divided into 2 parts. The first part of the study will be double-blinded and will last for 24 weeks. During this time subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either Repatha (evolocumab) QM or placebo QM. The second part of the study is a 24-week open label extension period. During this time all subjects will receive Repatha (evolocumab) QM. The clinical hypothesis is that subcutaneous Repatha (evolocumab) QM will be well tolerated and will result in greater reduction of LDL-C defined as percent change from baseline at week 24 compared with placebo QM in HIV-positive subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.    ,NCT02833844

HIV,Targeted Nurse-driven HIV Screening in Emergency Departments, To reduce late HIV diagnosis that remains common in France the national health agency has promoted non-targeted HIV screening in health care settings including emergency departments (EDs). In our previous survey non-targeted nurse-driven HIV screening by rapid tests was feasible well-accepted but identified only a few new HIV diagnoses mostly among patients at high-risk. Our findings consistent with results from other international groups suggest that a targeted strategy could be feasible efficient and cost-effective with fewer tests required. However the feasibility and the efficacy of this strategy remain unknown in France. The main aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of 2 strategies: 1) the combination of the nurse-driven HIV targeted screening and the current practice (physician-directed HIV diagnostic testing) versus 2) the current practice alone. The strategies will be compared during 2 randomly assigned periods (cluster randomization and cross-over) in 8 EDs of metropolitan Paris. During targeted period nurses will offer screening to all patients at EDs aged 18-64 years old identified as high-risk by a self-administered questionnaire not know to be HIV positive not being seen for post-exposure prophylaxis or unstable medical illness and accepting to participate by providing an informed consent. In case of confirmed reactive rapid test result a follow-up visit with an on-site infectious disease specialist will be arranged within the following 48 hours.    ,NCT02127424

Melanoma,Anti-gp100 Cells Plus ALVAC gp100 Vaccine to Treat Advanced Melanoma, Background:   -  gp100 is a protein that is often found in melanoma tumors.   -  An experimental procedure developed for treating patients with melanoma uses anti-gp100 cells designed to destroy their tumors. The anti-gp100 cells are created in the laboratory using the patient's own tumor cells or blood cells.   -  The treatment procedure also uses a vaccine called plaque purified canarypox vector (ALVAC) gp100 made from a virus that ordinarily infects canaries and is modified to carry a copy of the gp100 gene. The virus cannot reproduce in mammals so it cannot cause disease in humans. When the vaccine is injected into a patient it stimulates cells in the immune system that may increase the efficiency of the anti gp 100 cells. Objectives: -To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anti-gp100 cells and the ALVAC gp100 vaccine in treating patients with advanced melanoma. Eligibility: -Patients with metastatic melanoma for whom standard treatments have not been effective. Design:   -  Patients undergo scans x-rays and other tests and leukapheresis to obtain white cells for laboratory treatment.   -  Patients have 7 days of chemotherapy to prepare the immune system for receiving the gp100 cells.   -  Patients receive the ALVAC vaccine anti-gp100 cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) (an approved treatment for advanced melanoma). The anti gp100 cells are given as an infusion through a vein. The vaccine is given as injections just before the infusion of gp100 cells and again 2 weeks later. IL-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion every 8 hours for up to 5 days after the cell infusion for a maximum of 15 doses.   -  After hospital discharge patients return to the clinic for periodic follow-up with a physical examination review of treatment side effects laboratory tests and scans every 1 to 6 months.    ,NCT00610311
Melanoma,Chemotherapy Irradiation Cell Infusions and Interleukin-2 to Treat Metastatic Melanoma, Background:   -  In a study in humans with melanoma patients given total body irradiation to suppress the immune system in conjunction with chemotherapy showed a significant clinical response.   -  In previous studies about one-half of patients given tumor-fighting cells (cells created from the patient's tumor cells and grown in the laboratory) showed some anti-tumor response. Objective: To determine whether tumor-fighting cells taken from a melanoma tumor and grown in the lab can more effectively at fight melanoma when the patient's immune system is suppressed and cannot attack them. Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic melanoma who have tumor reactive cells available. Design: -Patients are assigned to one of two groups - those having received prior therapy with Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and those who have not. After five days of injections of filgrastim a medicine to stimulated the growth of white blood cells patients undergo apheresis or bone marrow harvesting or both to collect stem cells for later re-infusion. For apheresis whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and circulated through a cell-separating machine where the stem cells are extracted. The rest of the blood is returned through the same needle or a needle in the other arm. Bone marrow harvesting is done under general anesthesia. Stem cells are collected through a large needle inserted into the hipbone.-Patients' immune system cells and bone marrow function are eliminated with chemotherapy (7 days) and total body irradiation (3 days) so the patient's immune system cells will not fight the tumor-fighting cells they are given in treatment.   -  1 to 3 days after total body irradiation patients receive the tumor-fighting cells by intravenous (IV) infusion. After the cells are infused they receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) infusions every 8 hours for 5 days.   -  2 days after infusion of the tumor-fighting cells patients receive the stem cells collected earlier by apheresis.   -  Patients are evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after cell infusion to look for tumor response to treatment. Patients whose tumor has not grown return to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) every 1 to 3 months for blood tests scans and x-rays.    ,NCT00314106
Melanoma,Anti-MART-1 F5 Cells Plus ALVAC MART-1 Vaccine to Treat Advanced Melanoma, Background:   -  Melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART)-1 is a protein present in melanoma cells.   -  An experimental procedure developed for treating patients with melanoma uses the anti-MART-1 F5 gene and a type of virus to make special cells called anti-MART-1 F5 cells that are designed to destroy the patient's tumor. These cells are created in the laboratory using the patient's own tumor cells or blood cells.   -  The treatment procedure also uses a vaccine called plaque purified canarypox vector (ALVAC) MART-1 made from a virus that ordinarily infects canaries and is modified to carry a copy of the MART-1 gene. The virus cannot reproduce in mammals so it cannot cause disease in humans. When the vaccine is injected into a patient it stimulates cells in the immune system that may increase the efficiency of the anti-MART-1 F5 cells. Objectives: -To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anti-MART-1 F5 and the ALVAC vaccine in treating patients with advanced melanoma. Eligibility: -Patients 18 years of age with metastatic melanoma for whom standard treatments have not been effective. Design:   -  Patients undergo scans x-rays and other tests and leukapheresis to obtain white cells for laboratory treatment.   -  Patients have 7 days of chemotherapy to prepare the immune system for receiving the anti-MART-1 F5.   -  Patients receive the ALVAC vaccine anti-MART-1 F5 cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) (an approved treatment for advanced melanoma). The anti-MART-1 F5 cells are given as an infusion through a vein. The vaccine is given as injections just before the infusion of anti-MART-1 F5 cells and again 2 weeks later. IL-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion every 8 hours for up to 5 days after the cell infusion for a maximum of 15 doses.   -  After hospital discharge patients return to the clinic for periodic follow-up with a physical examination review of treatment side effects laboratory tests and scans every 1 to 6 months.    ,NCT00612222
Melanoma,Natural Killer Cells Plus IL-2 Following Chemotherapy to Treat Advanced Melanoma or Kidney Cancer, Background:   -  Natural killer (NK) cells are large lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) that are important in the immune response to cancer.   -  IL-2 (Aldesleukin) is a substance the body makes that controls the growth and function of many types of cells. The Food and Drug Administration has approved IL-3 for treating metastatic melanoma and kidney cancer. (Metastatic disease is cancer that has spread beyond the primary site.) Objectives: To determine the safety and effectiveness of treating metastatic melanoma and kidney cancer with laboratory-treated NK cells and IL-2. Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic melanoma or kidney cancer who have previously been treated with high-dose IL-2. Design:   -  Leukapheresis. Patients under leukapheresis to obtain NK cells for the treatment regimen. Blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and directed through a cell separator machine where white blood cells are extracted. The rest of the blood is returned to the patient through a needle in the other arm. NK cells are removed from the white blood cells and treated for re-infusion into the patient.   -  Chemotherapy. Starting 8 days before infusion of the treated NK cells patients receive intravenous (IV through a vein) infusions of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to suppress the immune system.   -  NK cell infusion. Patients receive a 30-minute IV infusion of NK cells 2 days after the last dose of chemotherapy.   -  IL-2 therapy. Within 24 hours of the NK cell infusion patients receive high-dose IL-2 as a 15-minute IV infusion every 8 hours for up to 5 days. A second cycle of IL-2 is given about 14 days after the first.   -  Blood tests and biopsy. Patients have frequent blood tests during the treatment period and may be asked to undergo a biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of tumor or lymph node) at the end of treatment to look at the effects of the treatment on the tumor immune cells.   -  Follow-up evaluation. Patients are evaluated 4-6 weeks after completing treatment. They have a physical examination scans of tumor sites blood tests and blood sampling (or leukapheresis) to examine the response to treatment. Patients who improve with treatment return for evaluations every month. Those whose tumor grows again after originally shrinking may receive one additional treatment course.    ,NCT00328861
Melanoma,Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Background:   -  The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors growing them in the laboratory in large numbers and then giving the cells back to the patient with aldesleukin (IL-2) a drug that keeps the white blood cells active. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma.   -  This study will use chemotherapy to prepare the immune system before this white blood cell treatment. Our prior studies indicate that aldesleukin may not be required for cell transfer. Objectives: - To see if chemotherapy and white blood cell therapy without aldesleukin is a safe and effective treatment for metastatic melanoma. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age and less than or equal to 70 years of age with metastatic melanoma. Design:   -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institute of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination scans x-rays lab tests and other tests as needed.   -  Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.   -  Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}   -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.   -  Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam review of side effects lab tests and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.    ,NCT01468818
Melanoma,Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Background:   -  The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors growing them in the laboratory in large numbers and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 400 patients with melanoma.   -  In this trial we are determining if there is a difference in the response between patients who have received prior anti-PD1 treatment to those who have not received this prior ant-PD1 treatment. Objectives: - To determine if there is a difference in the rate of response between patients who have received prior anti-PD1 and those who have not. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years of age who have metastatic melanoma. Design:   -  Work up stage: Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.   -  Surgery: Surgery or biopsy will be performed to obtain tumor from which to grow white blood cells. White blood cells will be grown from the tumor in the laboratory.   -  Leukapheresis: Participants will have leukapheresis to collect additional white blood cells. (Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.)   -  Treatment: Participants will receive standard dose chemotherapy to prepare their immune system to accept the white blood cells. Participants will receive an infusion of their own white blood cells grown from tumor. They will also receive aldesleukin for up to five days to boost the immune system s response to the white blood cells. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.   -  Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam review of side effects lab tests and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking.

Melanoma,Prospective Randomized Study of Cell Therapy for Metastatic Melanoma Using Short-Term Cultured Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Plus IL-2 Following Either a Non-Myeloablative Lymphocyte Depleting Chemotherapy Regimen Alone or in Conjunction w/1200 TBI, Background: - An experimental treatment for metastatic melanoma involves cell therapy in which researchers take white blood cells (lymphocytes) from the tumor tissue grow them in the laboratory in large numbers and then use the cells to attack the tumor tissue. Before receiving the cells chemotherapy is needed to temporarily suppress the immune system to improve the chances that the tumor-fighting cells will be able to survive in the body. In some studies of cell therapy individuals who have received total body irradiation (TBI) in addition to the chemotherapy (in order to increase the length of time that they do not produce white blood cells) seem to have a slightly better response to the treatment but it is not known if adding radiation to the cell therapy will cause a better response for all individuals. Researchers are interested in comparing cell therapy given with the usual chemotherapy to cell therapy given with the usual chemotherapy and TBI.

Melanoma,Use of IL-15 After Chemotherapy and Lymphocyte Transfer in Metastatic Melanoma, Background: - Researchers have developed an experimental cancer treatment called cell therapy. White blood cells called lymphocytes are taken from a tumor grown in large numbers in the lab and then given back to the patient. Interleukin-15 given to the patient after the cells (now called Young tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of Young TIL cells) are replaced helps the cells to grow and boosts the immune system. This process changes your normal cells into cells that are able to recognize your tumor has been studied in the lab. These cells can destroy tumor cells in the test tube but scientists want to see if they work inside the body. Objectives: -To test the effectiveness of lymphocytes drawn from tumor cells combined with interleukin-15 in treating metastatic melanoma. Eligibility:   -  Patients must be 18 - 66 years of age and have a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.   -  They will have heart and lung function tests lab tests and imaging procedures.   -  Patients may not have conditions such as active systemic infections blood clotting disorders or other active major medical illnesses.   -  Patients may not be pregnant or nursing.    ,NCT01369888
Melanoma,Melanoma Treatment With White Blood Cells That Destroy MART Expressing Tumor Cells, Background: - Some cancer treatments collect a patient s own blood cells to use as specialized cancer-fighting cells. Collected white blood cells known as PBL (peripheral blood lymphocytes) can use to isolate special cells that can fight tumors. Before treatment with PBL chemotherapy is given to destroy existing white blood cells so that the new cells can survive and attack the tumors. After PBL treatment aldesleukin is given to help the new cells grow. Researchers want to see if special white blood cells that recognize a specific protein that is present in melanoma cells (melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART)) can cause tumors to shrink. These white blood cells will be tested with and without aldesleukin. Objectives:   -  To test the safety and effectiveness of white blood cells that target MART in the treatment of melanoma.   -  To test white blood cells that target MART with and without aldesleukin. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have melanoma that has not responded to standard treatments. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine samples will be taken. Imaging studies such as x-rays or magnetic resonance imaging scans will be performed.   -  Participants will provide white blood cells through leukapheresis. Researchers will attempt to isolate white blood cells that recognize MART   -  Seven days before the start of treatment participants will have chemotherapy.   -  After the last dose of chemotherapy participants will receive the MART reactive PBL cells. Filgrastim doses will also be given to help white blood cell counts return to normal. Participants will have frequent blood tests.   -  Participants who are able to have aldesleukin treatment will start within 24 hours after receiving the MART reactive PBL cells. Treatment will continue for up to 5 days.   -  Participants may have an optional tumor or lymph node biopsy to study the effects of treatment.   -  If the tumor continues to grow after MART PBL treatment participants may have one more round of cell collection and treatment.   -  Participants will have followup visits for up to 6 months after receiving the MART reactive PBL treatment.    ,NCT01495572
Melanoma,Modified Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Metastatic Melanoma, Background: - Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are white blood cells that have been taken from tumor tissue. The cells are modified to help them kill tumor cells then given back to the person with cancer. By giving these cells to patients researchers hope to improve the current treatments available for patients with melanoma that has not responded to standard therapies. The TIL will be given after treatments that will suppress the immune system. This makes it easier for the TIL to attack the cancer cells. The TIL will also be given with aldesleukin (IL-2) which is designed to help keep the TIL cells alive in the body. Objectives: - To study the safety and effectiveness of specially modified tumor infiltrating lymphocytes to treat melanoma that has not responded to other treatments. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have metastatic melanoma that has not responded to other treatments. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood tests and imaging studies.   -  A piece of tumor will be collected and white blood cells will be separated to make the TIL for the treatment.   -  Participants will take drugs to suppress the immune system for 7 days before the start of treatment.   -  Participants will receive the TIL in a single dose. Then they will receive IL-2 every 8 hours for up to 15 doses. Participants will remain in the hospital for up to 2 weeks after treatment. They will be monitored with frequent blood tests and other studies.   -  After leaving the hospital participants will have regular followup visits every 1 to 4 months for the first year. Then they will return for followup every 3 to 4 months as directed by the study researchers.    ,NCT01369875
Melanoma,Vemurafenib and TIL Therapy for Metastatic Melanoma, Background: Adoptive T cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has been reported to induce durable clinical responses in patients with metastatic melanoma. From patients own tumor material T cells are extracted expanded and activated in vitro in a 4-6 weeks culture period. Before TIL infusion patients are preconditioned with a lymphodepleting chemotherapeutic regimen. After TIL infusion patients are treated with IL-2 to support T cell activation and expansion in vivo. The BRAF inhibitor is an approved treatment of metastatic melanoma and functions by selectively inhibiting the BRAF mutated enzyme consequently halting the proliferation of tumor cells. Furthermore in vitro tests have shown that vemurafenib has immunomodulatory effects that are hypothesized to synergize with TIL therapy which has been confirmed in animal studies. Objectives:   -  To evaluate safety and feasibility when combining vemurafenib and ACT with TILs.   -  To evaluate treatment related immune responses   -  To evaluate clinical efficacy Design:   -  Patients will be screened with a physical exam medical history blood samples and ECG.   -  Patients will start vemurafenib 960 mg BID and will continue during TIL preparation.   -  7 days after start of vemurafenib patients will undergo surgery to harvest tumor material for TIL production.   -  Patient stops vemurafenib and is admitted day -8 in order to undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludara starting day -7.   -  On day 0 patients receive TIL infusion and shortly after starts IL-2 infusion continually following the decrescendo regimen.   -  The patients will followed until progression or up to 5 years.    ,NCT02354690
Melanoma,Mechanism of Action of High-Dose IL-2 (Aldesleukin) in Metastatic Melanoma and Kidney Cancer, Background: -Although IL-2 can shrink tumors in about 20 percent of patients with metastatic kidney cancer and in 15 percent of patients with metastatic melanoma it is not fully known how the drug works. Objectives: -To better understand how IL-2 causes tumors to shrink. Eligibility: -Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic kidney cancer or metastatic melanoma Design:   -  135 patients with melanoma and 110 patients with kidney cancer may be enrolled.   -  Patients are hospitalized for about 7 days for each treatment. They receive IL-2 intravenously (through a vein) over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 4 days or 12 doses. This constitutes one treatment cycle.   -  Research blood samples are collected daily during the first treatment cycle and for one or two days following the last dose.   -  Patients may be asked to undergo leukapheresis a procedure for collecting large quantities of white blood cells. This involves collecting blood through a needle in an arm vein. The blood is directed through a cell separator where the white cells are extracted. The rest of the blood (red cells platelets and plasma) is returned to the patient through the same needle or through a needle in the other arm.   -  About 7-10 days after discharge from the hospital patients return for a second treatment cycle but without research blood sampling.   -  2 months after therapy patients are evaluated with scans and x-rays and blood tests to evaluate the tumor and the effects of the treatment on immune cells.   -  Patients whose tumors shrink or remain stable may continue treatment (without repeating the full set of research blood samples) as long as they benefit from the treatment and do not develop unacceptable side effects. Patients who continue treatment are evaluated every 2 months for 3 to 4 times and then every 3 to 6 months.    ,NCT00304460
Melanoma,Chemotherapy Followed by ESO-1 Lymphocytes and Aldesleukin to Treat Metastatic Cancer, Background: -This study uses an experimental cancer treatment that uses the patient s own lymphocytes (type of white blood cell) which are specially selected and genetically modified to target and destroy their tumor. Objectives: -To test the safety of the treatment and determine if it can cause the patient s tumor to shrink. Eligibility:   -  Patients greater than 18 years and less than or equal to 66 years of age whose cancer has spread beyond the original site and does not respond to standard treatment.   -  Patients have tissue type human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201.   -  Patients cancer cells have the ESO-1 gene. Design:   -  Workup: Patients have scans x-rays laboratory tests and other tests as needed.   -  Patients have leukapheresis to collect cells for laboratory treatment and later reinfusion. For this procedure whole blood is collected thorough a tube in a vein the desired cells are extracted from the blood and the rest of the blood is returned to the patient.   -  Chemotherapy: Patients have low-dose chemotherapy for 1 week to prepare the immune system to receive the treated lymphocytes.   -  Cell infusion and aldesleukin (IL-2) treatment: Patients receive the lymphocytes by a 30-minute infusion through a vein. Starting within 24 hours of the infusion they receive high-dose aldesleukin infusions every 8 hours for up to 5 days (maximum15 doses).   -  Recovery: Patients rest for 1 to 2 weeks to recover from the effects of chemotherapy and aldesleukin.   -  Tumor biopsy: Patients may be asked to undergo a biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of tumor) after treatment to look at the effects of treatment on the immune cells in the tumor.   -  Follow-up: After treatment is completed patients return to the clinic once a month for several months for physical examinations a review of side effects laboratory tests and scans. They may undergo leukapheresis at some visits to look at the effect of treatment on the immune system and check the viability of the infused cells. Patients then return to the National Institute of Health (NIH) clinic once a year for 5 years and then complete a follow-up questionnaire for another 10 years.   -  Retreatment: Patients whose tumor shrinks or disappears following treatment and then recurs may receive one additional treatment using the same regimen of chemotherapy lymphocyte infusion and IL-2 treatment.    ,NCT00670748
Melanoma,Study of Everolimus With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Based on data demonstrating synergy between paclitaxel and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition the investigators propose that the addition of everolimus to paclitaxel with carboplatin should lead to improvements in efficacy as measured by progression-free survival and response rate.    ,NCT01014351
Melanoma,Combination Therapy With Nivolumab and PD-L1/IDO Peptide Vaccine to Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Combination therapy is becoming more and more general in the treatment of oncological diseases. In this clinical trial combination the standard immunotherapeutic treatment; the programmed death 1 (PD-1) regulatory antibody Nivolumab and a peptide vaccine consisting of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Indoleamine 23-dioxygenase (IDO) peptides will be tested in patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients will be treated with Nivolumab every second week as long as there is clinical benefit. The PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine is given from start of Nivolumab and every second week for the first 6 vaccines and thereafter every fourth week up to 1 year.    ,NCT03047928
Melanoma,Dendritic Cell Vaccines + Dasatinib for Metastatic Melanoma, Current therapeutic approaches available for patients with advanced-stage melanoma remain inadequate and existing approaches including those involving immunotherapy with cytokines and/or targeted strategies have resulted in disappointingly low rates of durable and complete responses. Correcting immune dysfunction in advanced-stage melanoma patients using tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as dasatinib is proposed to relicense the patient's immune system to respond optimally to specific immunization. The integration of antigens expressed by tumor-associated blood vessel cells provides a means to selectively target the genetically-/antigenically-heterogeneous population of tumor cells in the advanced-stage melanoma patient. This is a single-center prospective randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the activity safety and immune effects of dasatinib given in combination with an autologous type-1 polarized Dendritic Cell (Î±DC1) vaccine. The current trial represents a randomized Phase 2 study to determine the activity and safety of intradermal (id) administration of Î±DC1s loaded with a mixture of six TBVA-derived peptides at the time of or immediately after an initial therapy cycle with the TKI dasatinib. Dasatinib will be administered at the standard dose and schedule recommended by the FDA (70 mg BID). The autologous type-I DC vaccine will be administered either prior to or concomitant with the initiation of dasatinib administration. All patients will receive dasatinib at a starting dose of 70 mg twice daily by mouth in the outpatient setting approximately every 12 hours at the same time each day. The DC vaccine will be administered by a single intradermal injection of approximately 10e7 cells with all the DCs being administered on days 1 and 15 of every cycle on an outpatient basis in the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Research Center (UPCI-CTRC). Patients on Arm A will start dasatinib administration on cycle 2 day 1 (week 5) while those patients in Arm B will start dasatinib administration on cycle 1 day 1 (week 1). Men and women at least 18 years of age must be HLA-A2+ and have histologically confirmed melanoma that is metastatic (Stage IV) or unresectable Stage IIIB/C and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.    ,NCT01876212
Melanoma,Peptide Vaccination Associated With Tumoral Immunomodulation in Patients With Advanced Metastatic Melanoma, Human cancers express tumor antigens that can be targeted by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). These antigens consist of a small peptide derived from endogenous proteins that is presented at the cancer cell's surface by an HLA class I molecule. Such antigenic peptides including MAGE-3.A1 and NA17.A2 have been tested in experimental therapeutic vaccines to elicit CTL responses in cancer patients mainly with metastatic melanoma. Up to now only rare tumor responses have been observed. Tumor resistance to CTL killing is the most likely explanation for the poor effectiveness of cancer vaccines. This resistance is probably acquired by the tumor during its development and selected by its repetitive challenge with spontaneous anti-tumoral immune responses. The precise molecular mechanisms of tumor resistance remain unknown. The observation that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) purified from melanoma metastases can recognize and kill autologous tumor cells in vitro whilst they seem unable to control tumor growth in vivo suggests that this resistance is hosted by the tumor environment rather than being the result of a generalized immune suppression. The investigators have developed a murine model of cutaneous graft rejection that mimics the situation in melanoma. Female CBA mice do not reject syngeneic male skin grafts even though they mount a spontaneous CTL response against H-Y a male specific minor histocompatibility antigen following grafting. The investigators have tested various experimental procedures aimed at inducing effective graft rejection in these mice. This was obtained with a combination of IFN-Î± IL-2 GM-CSF each administered separately under the skin graft associated with topical applications of imiquimod. All these agents are available as registered drugs. Based on this murine model of cutaneous allograft rejection the investigators postulate that local immunomodulation with this combination can trigger an effective tumor rejection process and induce a more efficient and long-lasting anti-tumoral immune response following peptide vaccination.    ,NCT01191034
Melanoma,Study Comparing TIL to Standard Ipilimumab in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, In this randomized controlled phase III study the investigators will evaluate whether TIL infusion preceded by non-myeloablative chemotherapy and followed by high dose bolus interleukin-2 can result in an improved progression free survival when randomly compared to ipilimumab in 168 stage IV melanoma patients. A health technology assessment (HTA) will be performed to evaluate the impact of the TIL treatment on patients and organizational processes and cost-effectivity.    ,NCT02278887
Melanoma,Study of Immune Responses in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, In this study anti-OX40 will be given to patients with melanoma to find out how the immune system responds to treatment with anti-OX40. It is hoped that this treatment will cause an immune response against melanoma resulting in tumor regression but this is not known at this time. Anti-OX40 is a large protein that can help immune cells that fight bacteria viruses and cancer cells.    ,NCT01416844
Melanoma,Isolated Limb Perfusion of Melphalan for Melanoma and Sarcoma Treatment, In-transit metastases occur in approximately 3% of melanoma patients can be very symptomatic and the survival in this group may be prolonged. In-transit melanoma metastases are often confined to a limb. In this circumstance treatment by isolated limb perfusion or isolated limb infusion can be a remarkably effective regional treatment option. Isolated limb infusion (ILI) was introduced in 1992 and is a technique used to deliver regional chemotherapy to treat advanced melanoma confined to a limb. Regional chemotherapy with melphalan delivered by isolated limb perfusion (ILP) or ILI are effective treatment options for in-transit melanoma and are generally well tolerated. ILI is a less invasive and simpler alternative to ILP. Complete response rates are 45- 69% for ILP and 23-44% for ILI. The limb is often warmed to lower temperatures in ILI compared to ILP and the limb becomes progressively more hypoxic and acidotic during ILI each of these parameters potentially having an effect on outcome. ILP & ILI are used primarily as palliative options when excision of in-transit metastases is unfeasible but can be used as an adjunctive procedure to surgery for other tumour types such as merkel cell carcinoma and can be repeated if indicated. For ILI correction of melphalan dose for ideal body weight has been shown to substantially decrease the rates of severe local toxicity while maintaining complete response rates but overall response rate is reduced. Response to ILI moreover is different in upper and lower limbs. ILI for Upper limbs disease is associated with similar complete response rates but lower toxicity than ILI for Lower limbs E disease and with different physiologic sequelae despite comparable methods. The Upper limbs appears relatively resistant to toxic effects of melphalan-based ILI as currently performed which suggests a potential for further optimization of drug dosing for Upper limbs ILI. Regional therapy is an excellent therapeutic modality for disease limited to a limb and furthermore serves as an excellent model for scientific investigation both clinical and translational. In this study we want to collect data on isolated limb infusion of chemotherapy to monitor efficacy and tolerability in patients with melanoma metastases of the arm or leg that cannot be removed by surgery.    ,NCT01920516
Melanoma,A Phase 3 Study to Compare Efficacy and Safety of Masitinib to Dacarbazine in the Treatment of Patients With Non-Resectable or Metastatic Stage 3 or Stage 4 Melanoma Carrying a Mutation in the Juxta Membrane Domain of C-Kit, Masitinib is a novel TKI that potently inhibits wild type (WT) c-kit and its activated form mutated in the juxtamembrane region (JM c-kit) PDGFRs the intracellular kinase Lyn and to a lesser extent fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Pre-clinical data suggest that masitinib is a strong candidate for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma carrying a c-kit JM mutation.    ,NCT01280565
Melanoma,Interest of the 18F-DOPA-PET Imaging in Metastatic Melanoma Treated With B-RAF Inhibitors: a Pilot Study, Melanoma incidence is increasing in most developed countries. At the metastatic stage the prognosis is usually poor. Major advances have been obtained over the last 3 years with the development of therapies targeting the MAP kinases pathway. Vemurafenib (zelborafÂ®) is approved in France since 2012 as first treatment of metastatic melanoma carrying a B-RAF mutation. For growth the tumor needs an adequate supply of nutrients to allow the synthesis of macromolecules and a contribution in carbon elements to ensure the production of energy. The nutrition demand is met through greater availability of nutrients via tumor angiogenesis and through increased intracellular penetration of nutrients via specific upregulation of transport systems and metabolic pathways. Scanner is the imaging method most commonly used for the evaluation of therapeutic response. Such a method gives a morphological indication but does not evaluate the metabolic response. With the development of functional imaging techniques and the advent of positron emission tomography (PET) it is now possible to obtain an assessment of the metabolic activity of tumors. The use of 18F-FDG to assess therapeutic responses to targeted therapies is fairly recent. The advantage of this approach is well documented for GIST and non-small cell lung cancer. In melanoma the metabolic response to 18F-FDG is much faster than the response to TAP scanner. 18F-FDG tracer that targets glucose metabolism is the most sensitive functional imaging in melanoma which has hindered the development of other tracers such as 18F-FDOPA and 18F-FLT. The 18F-FDG TEP can thus be used in the initial staging and follow-up of the disease a situation in which it can replace the TAP scanner additional brain imaging remaining necessary. The use of metabolic imaging to study the response to targeted therapies in melanoma has been the subject of only one publications. There was a trend toward improved progression-free survival in patients with high metabolic response at day J15. For melanoma the diagnostic sensitivity of PET 18F-FDOPA is lower than that of 18F-FDG (64% versus 95%). In contrast the 18F-FDOPA tracer has the advantage of allowing a brain assessment which is critical in melanoma that gives frequent metastases in the central nervous system. There has never been any evaluation of the metabolic response to targeted therapies such as BRAF inhibitors PET with 18F-FDOPA. The investigators propose to conduct a monocentric prospective preliminary study to explore the potential usefulness of the metabolic PET imaging with 18F-FDOPA in the evaluation of metabolic response of B-RAF mutated metastatic melanoma treated with vemurafenib.    ,NCT02038348
Melanoma,The Role of Peptide-loaded Dendritic Cells to Augment the Therapeutic Effect of Interleukin-2, Melanoma is the main cause of death in patients with skin cancer. Once it has metastasized this cancer has been shown to respond to chemotherapy only in rare cases. Immunotherapy represents an approach to treatment based on the immune response to cancer antigens. The principal objective of the study is to identify whether a dendritic cell-based vaccine can increase the moderate therapeutic effect of bolus high dose IL-2 in patients with metastatic melanoma. For this purposepatients with metastatic melanoma who have a certain blood type (HLA-A201+) will be treated systemically with high dose IL-2. In one group of patients the IL-2 will be preceded by three doses of autologous dendritic cell pulsed with melanoma antigens appropriate for their blood type. Two cycles of three DC vaccines will be administered every 14 days by intra-lymph node injections followed by high dose IL-2 treatment. Responding patients will receive additional DC vaccines at 1 month and 2 months intervals. In a second group patients will receive the standard high dose IL-2 protocol within a comparable period of time. Each group will include 12 patients. A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be performed prior to accrual after initial 3 DC vaccines six weeks after first IL-2 treatment after a total of 6 DC vaccines and 6 weeks after second cycle of IL-2 treatment.    ,NCT00279058
Melanoma,Adoptive Cell Therapy Following Non-myeloablate Chemotherapy in Metastatic Melanoma Patients, Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive and highly malignant cancer. The five-year survival rate of patients with metastatic disease is less than 5% with a median survival of only 6-10 months. Drugs like Dacarbazin (DTIC) as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents have a response rate of 15-30% but the duration of response is usually short with no impact on survival. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) based immunotherapy has shown more promising results. This form of therapy has a similar response rate with some patients achieving a durable complete response. Recently the National Institute of Health (NIH) reported that by using lympho-depleting chemotherapy followed by an adoptive transfer of large numbers of anti-tumor specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) an objective regression was achieved in 51% of patients with metastatic melanoma. Objectives: To introduce the TIL technology to advanced metastatic melanoma patients in Israel.    ,NCT00287131

GMX1777 is rapidly converted to GMX1778 in vivo. GMX1778 has potent anti-tumor activity against a variety of cell lines and models from different tumor origins.    ,NCT00724841
Melanoma,Local Modulation of Immune Receptors to Enhance the Response to Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Metastatic Melanoma, Our proposed study is designed to test the safety of a new vaccine against melanoma. The induction of immune activity against cancers such as melanoma is a promising approach to cancer treatment but to date only a few clinically significant immune responses have been seen following vaccine therapy. This is an important problem since there are very limited treatment options for patients with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread to lymph nodes and organs). Studies suggest that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block inhibitory receptors on immune cells can enhance the immune responses against cancer but the intravenous injection of such mAbs has caused severe side effects in animals and humans. In our laboratory we have developed a method to deliver mAbs and other proteins that block such inhibitory receptors locally at the site where immune responses against melanoma proteins are stimulated by vaccination enhancing anti-melanoma immunity while avoiding the side-effects associated with intravenous injection of these immune modulators. This is achieved by loading dendritic cells a type of immune cell with RNA that encodes the immune modulator. The RNA-loaded dendritic cells then make the immune modulatory proteins and release them locally. By mixing these dendritic cells with additional dendritic cells loaded with melanoma proteins the immune modulators are released at the site where anti-melanoma immune cells are stimulated. In this phase I trial subjects with metastatic melanoma will undergo the process of leukapheresis in which white blood cells are removed from the body. Monocytes a type of immune cell will then be purified from the white blood cells and cultured under conditions that will change them into dendritic cells. Half of these dendritic cells are then loaded with melanoma antigen RNA which will lead to the production of melanoma antigen proteins within the dendritic cells. The remaining half of the dendritic cells will be either untreated or loaded with RNA encoding immune modulators so that these dendritic cells will release immune modulators at the site of vaccination. These dendritic cells will be mixed with the melanoma antigen-loaded dendritic cells and injected as a vaccine into lymph nodes. Each subject will receive six weekly injections of their own dendritic cells. Safety and toxicity will be closely monitored. In addition immune responses against melanoma as well as clinical responses will be assessed.    ,NCT01216436
Melanoma,Whole Brain Radiotherapy Following Local Treatment of Intracranial Metastases of Melanoma, People with brain metastases from melanoma are offered different treatment options after local treatment of their brain metastases via surgery or stereotactic irradiation. Depending on the treating institution and the clinician involved a patient may or may not be offered whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) after their brain metastases are excised or treated with stereotactic irradiation. This trial seeks to determine if WBRT reduces the spread of brain metastases and lengthens the time to recurrence. The trial also examines the effect of WBRT on quality of life and brain functions such as memory speech and concentration. Participants will be randomised after local treatment of their brain metastases to either WBRT or observation. 220 people will be recruited from sites in Australia Norway the UK the US and other international sites.    ,NCT01503827
Melanoma,HD IL-2 + Ipilimumab in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Phase IV open-label randomized two-arm multi-center study in patients with metastatic melanoma who are treatment naÃ¯ve or have previously received a single non-immunologic therapy. Treatment Arm 1: Patients will receive two courses (four cycles) of High Dose Interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) followed by one course (four doses) of ipilimumab. Treatment Arm 2: Patients will receive one course (four doses) of ipilimumab followed by two courses (four cycles) of HD IL-2. HD IL-2 and ipilimumab dosing regimens will comply with the instructions in the most current package inserts institutional guidelines and medical expertise of the treating physician. However neither the ipilimumab nor the HD IL-2 should be dose reduced. If necessary doses should be either held or permanently discontinued (per package insert instructions). Protocol specific dosing guidance is included in the 12PLK02 Work Instructions. Patients will be scheduled for four response assessments. Response assessment timing should be targeted to fall within the following time points: between 5-11 weeks 13-19 weeks 24-30 weeks and one year after initiating therapy in either treatment arm. Timing of the response assessments may be adjusted to facilitate clinical procedures and treatment decisions. Patient treatment tolerability and safety events will be monitored and managed while enrolled in the 12PLK02 study. Patients who receive HD IL-2 in the 12PLK02 study will be enrolled in the PROCLAIM study (Registry Protocol 10PLK13) for the collection of long-term assessment data including response and disease status and treatment decisions. Patient treatment data will be entered in to the PROCLAIM database for a minimum target of 2 years and potentially up to 5 years after the patient completes the 12PLK02 study.    ,NCT01856023

Melanoma,Treatment of Metastatic Melanoma With Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes and IL-2 Following Lympho-depleting Chemotherapy, Prior preclinical and clinical studies have shown that tumors from patients with advanced melanoma contain tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with anti-tumor reactivity. These TIL can be expanded in the laboratory to large numbers and reinfused to the patient. Using a chemotherapy regimen that selectively kills lymphocytes a single institution Phase II study of 35 patients showed a 51% objective response rate to TIL and interleukin-2 injection. In the present trial we would like to investigate whether we can achieve similar results in a Hadassah Phase II study and to determine the feasibility of applying this approach to patients with advanced melanoma who currently have few treatment options.    ,NCT00604136

Melanoma,Study of MAGE-3/Melan-A/gp 100/NA17 and rhIL-12 With/Out Low Dose IL-2 in Metastatic Melanoma, Purpose of investigation: Primary hypotheses: Immunization of patients with 4 melanoma antigen peptides will induce augmented specific IFN-y-producing CD8+ T cells against all 4 antigens simultaneously. Immunization with 4 melanoma antigen peptides will increase the response rate from 10% to 30%. Administration of low-dose IL-2 following each vaccine will result in a greater than 3-fold increase in specific T cells compared to no IL-2. Secondary hypotheses: Immunization will clear the blood of detectable circulating melanoma cells. Tumors that grow despite induction of melanoma antigen-specific T cells may lack expression of antigens class I MHC or the TAP peptide transporter or may fail to show increased expression of mRNA for IFN-y or perforin. Tumors that resist vaccination may express a different array of genes than those that are susceptible to vaccination.    ,NCT00203879

Melanoma,Phase I/II Study of High-Dose Calcitriol Plus Temodar for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as temozolomide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Calcitriol may help temozolomide kill more tumor cells by making them more sensitive to the drug. Calcitriol may also stop the growth of melanoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the best dose of calcitriol the side effects of calcitriol when given together with temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating patients with metastatic stage IV melanoma.    ,NCT00301067
Melanoma,Temozolomide and Sunitinib Malate in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Malignant Melanoma, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as temozolomide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving temozolomide together with sunitinib malate may kill more tumor cells. Phase II was never conducted due to toxicity in phase I. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sunitinib malate when given together with temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III or stage IV malignant melanoma.    ,NCT01005472
Melanoma,Study of Molecular Mechanisms Implicated in the Pathogenesis of Melanoma. Role of Exosomes, Recent progresses have been made in the treatment of metastatic melanoma nevertheless improved patient survival is still limited because of primary resistance and relapses. It is therefore important to continue to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in melanoma development and progression to improve the management of patients. Drugs such as the alkylating agents (temozolomide and fotemustine) or vemurafenib trigger senescence-like phenotypes in melanoma cells. It is now known that senescent cells secrete some factors that exert a pro-tumoral role but the potential existence and the role of insoluble factors remain undetermined. Preliminary results from the investigators laboratory indicate the presence in the senescent secretome of exosomes; microvesicles involved in intercellular communication immunomodulatory functions and tumorigenesis. Several studies showed that these vesicles shape the tumor microenvironment and contribute to the migration of cancer cells. Their interest in oncology as a prognostic factor and marker of therapeutic response is increasing. Thus our project aims to study the effect of exosomes produced by senescent melanoma cells in the development and progression of melanoma in vitro and in vivo using cell cultures and animal models. In addition the investigator propose a pilot study whose objective is to determine the effect of vemurafenib on nanovesicles produced by patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The investigator hope to show that exosomes participate in the process of drug resistance and relapse with the goal of developing (with the exosomes study) theranostic tools for personalized care in patients.    ,NCT02310451

Melanoma,Standard Palliative Care Versus Standard Palliative Care Plus Polychemotherapy in Metastasized Malignant Melanoma, The purpose of this multicenter study is to examine whether the proposed randomized treatment regime results in a significantly longer survival time and higher quality of life than any additionally applied multiple chemotherapy according to the CVD- scheme. So far neither established treatment regimes nor reliable data exist for the second-line chemotherapy of metastatic malignant melanoma. Patients are therefore mostly treated with single or multiple chemotherapeutics or/and immunomodulatory therapeutics. These regimes however imply often not only a higher toxicity but show rarely a response rate higher than 10%.    ,NCT00226473
Melanoma,Study of Gene Modified Immune Cells in Patients With Advanced Melanoma, The purpose of this phase 2 study is to find the best way to give this new experimental regimen and determine if it can treat metastatic melanoma in humans. In this phase 2 study the experimental products are given initially to a group of 8 people. If safe and found to have significant anti-tumor activity it will be given to up to 14 other people for a total of 22 people in this study. Physicians watch subjects carefully for any harmful side effects. Although the experimental regimen has been well tested in laboratory and animal studies and a similar regimen has been given to a group of patients at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda MD the side effects in people cannot be completely known ahead of time. This protocol is offered only to people whose condition cannot be helped by other known treatments. The study procedures will start with the collection of white blood cells through apheresis (a procedure in which blood is drawn from a patient and separated into its components some of which are retained such as white blood cells and the remainder returned by transfusion to the patient). Subjects will be asked to undergo two aphereses one to make the gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs and the dendritic cell vaccines and a second one after the subject receives the gene modified cells to later study them in the blood. On the day of the first apheresis subjects will be admitted to the hospital and will receive chemotherapy over the next five days which decreases the risk of rejection of the transferred cells by the subject's immune system and facilitates their expansion and attack of the melanoma lesions. During this time the gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs and the dendritic cells will be manufactured in the laboratory from the apheresis product and will be extensively tested to assure that they express the appropriate TCR and that they do not contain any contaminating bacteria or virus. Then the gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs will be given back to the subject through a vein in the arm. It will be followed by vaccination with the dendritic cells under the skin. During the next fourteen days subjects will also receive interleukin 2 (IL-2) which is a standard treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. During the next 2 to 3 weeks subjects will stay in the hospital until the study investigators determine that the subject has fully recovered from all of the procedures and it is safe for the subject to go home. Chemotherapy frequently causes a decrease in the platelet or red blood cells and therefore subjects may require platelet and/or red blood cell transfusions.    ,NCT00910650

Melanoma,A Study of Everolimus in Combination With Imatinib in Metastatic Melanoma, The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of everolimus and imatinib will slow the growth of or cause a reduction in the size of the cancer and to determine the side effects of the combination in patients with melanoma. Each of the drugs in this combination if used alone would not be expected to have an effect against the cancer. However when used together there is a possibility that they could work together to damage the cancer cells or to block the formation or function of the blood vessels that feed the cancer either of which could result in slowing the growth of or shrinking the cancer. Both drugs work by blocking signals that are sent from outside of a cell to the inside of the cell that direct the cell to make certain substances to keep the cell alive. Cancer cells or blood vessels that feed cancer cells may be more sensitive to drugs that block these signals.    ,NCT00402662

Melanoma,Radiotherapy & Combi in Metastatic Melanoma, The purpose of this study is to investigate the side effects and safety and effectiveness of combining dabrafenib and trametinib with radiotherapy. Previous and ongoing clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of combining both dabrafenib and trametinib compared with dabrafenib alone. This has led to the approval for the use of both drugs in combination in people with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF mutation. Melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body may also benefit from radiotherapy to help reduce symptoms from melanoma. Previous studies have shown that melanoma may be sensitive to radiotherapy and that it can help to improve quality of life. The intention of the CombiRT study is to establish if dabrafenib trametinib and radiotherapy combined is a safe and effective treatment for metastatic melanoma.    ,NCT02392871
Melanoma,Clinical Trial of Sutent to Treat Metastatic Melanoma," The purpose of this study is to investigate whether an investigational drug called sunitinib malate is safe and effective in treating metastatic melanoma in patients with KIT mutations. KIT is a gene that ""codes for"" (contains the genetic code that the body uses to make) a protein on the surface of cells in your body that is important in cell growth and cell division. The KIT protein seems to play a role in abnormal cell growth seen in acute leukemia germ cell tumors gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and certain melanomas. Melanomas that arise on acral skin (palms soles nail beds) mucosal membranes and chronically sun damaged skin have recently been found to frequently contain mutations or increased copy numbers of the KIT gene. Your tumor tissue has previously been tested and has been found to contain abnormalities in the KIT gene. Sunitinib malate is drug that has been shown to inhibit the activity of the KIT protein. The FDA approved sunitinib in 2006 for patients with GIST. It has been shown that sunitinib malate works in these patients because of its activity against the KIT protein. The FDA also approved Sunitinib malate in 2006 for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer where its effectiveness is probably due to its ability to block a different set of proteins. Sunitinib malate has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.    ",NCT00631618

Melanoma,Phase I/II Study of ADI-SS PEG 20000mw in Patients With Advanced Metastatic Melanoma, The purpose of this study is to test a new drug called ADI-SS PEG 20000 mw in patients with melanoma. The study drug (ADI-SS PEG 20000 mw) is being used because it causes a nutrient called arginine to break down. Arginine is an amino acid. Amino acids are the building blocks that our bodies use to make proteins. Normal cells do not require arginine. Melanoma cells however seem to need arginine to survive. ADI-SS PEG 20000 mw will be used as a way to starve melanoma cells and stop them from growing.    ,NCT00520299
Melanoma,A Phase I/II Open-Label Study of Ipilimumab and GM-CSF Administered to Unresectable Stage IIIC and Stage IV Melanoma Patients, The purpose of this study is to test the combination of Ipilimumab and GM-CSF.

Melanoma,A Phase I/II Study of Dasatinib and Dacarbazine, The purpose of this study is to: Phase I Objectives:   -  Find the most tolerated dose to use for Phase II   -  Collect information on how the body responds to this combination of study drug Phase II Objectives:   -  To determine the overall response of participants using this combination of study drug The expression of proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (Src) a substance present in a significant proportion of melanomas plays a role in the growth multiplying and dividing of cancer cells. Melanoma cells appear to be sensitive to these agents that block the action of Src in concentrations that can be achieved in patients. We suggest that Src inhibitors (such as Dasatinib) may be a good choice for treatment of melanoma in combination with Dacarbazine (a chemotherapy drug that can cause the shrinkage of melanomas). We wish to to evaluate the Src inhibitor Dasatinib in combination with the chemotherapy drug Dacarbazine. The novel oral Src inhibitor Dasatinib may be able to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy for melanoma compared to chemotherapy alone. Dacarbazine is a standard treatment for melanoma currently. The effectiveness of this chemotherapy drug may be increased by combination with Dasatinib. Dacarbazine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating melanoma; Dasatinib has been approved by the FDA to treat leukemia but it has not been approved alone or in combination with Dacarbazine to treat melanoma.    ,NCT00597038

Melanoma,Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation and Bevacizumab or Ipilimumab as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery, This randomized phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and bevacizumab or ipilimumab works as first-line therapy in treating patients with stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by binding to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and by preventing the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Ipilimumab blocks a substance called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) on the surface of T cells and may help the immune system kill cancer cells. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and bevacizumab is more effective than ipilimumab in treating melanoma.    ,NCT02158520

Melanoma,Evaluation of Photosensitivity in Dabrafenib or Vemurafenib Treated Metastatic Melanoma Patients - a Phase IIa/IIb Study, The BRAF inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib belong both two a new class of potent anti-cancer drugs and are highly efficacious in tumors harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. Both drugs seem to be equally efficacious; however their toxicity profile seems to differ. Serious phototoxicity has been observed in ~ 30% of patients treated with vemurafenib and in ~2 percent of patients treated with dabrafenib. These phototoxic reactions have developed in spite of informing the patients of this possible adverse event and instructing them to protect themselves. Manifestation of phototoxic reactions depends on the patient's habits of exposure and their efforts to protect themselves. The true frequency of photosensitivity can only be established by systematic photo-testing. In dermatology standard test procedures with different UV-wavelengths and dosages have been established and the primary goal of this study will be to clarify the true rate of photosensitivity by these two BRAF-inhibitors. Furthermore systematic experience will be collected how to best protect patients from phototoxic events. Dabrafenib and Vemurafenib are commercially available and considered standard of care for BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma in Germany. As the number of patients will not allow any conclusion with regard to efficacy or safety of vemurafenib patients randomized to vemurafenib in part 2 will only remain on study until completion of phototesting.    ,NCT02052193
Melanoma,Pilot Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Metformin in Melanoma, In western countries melanoma represents a major mistake of public health by its frequency lethality and the increasing of incidence. Surgery can cure melanoma diagnosed very early. In other cases it exists a risk of recurrence of lymph node and visceral. At the stage of visceral metastases the prognosis of melanoma is catastrophic with a median survival of 6 months. Indeed the reference chemotherapy by dacarbazine induces a very limited response rate of 10-20% the ipilimumab which has been authorized in the second intention has a response rate of 10% and other available treatments don't have a superior efficiency. Metformin is an oral antidiabetic of biguanides family which acts by inducing the activation of AMPK a molecule which is inactivated in many cancers including the melanoma. In agreement with these data several preclinical studies suggested that metformin has antineoplastic activity. In the case of melanoma a study published recently has showed that metformin inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro and we confirmed for our part these results in our laboratory (INSERM U895).    ,NCT01840007

Melanoma,Evaluation of Groin Lymphadenectomy Extent For Metastatic Melanoma, BACKGROUND: Spread of metastatic melanoma to the groin lymph nodes (LN) is a common event affecting about 350 people a year in Australia. Globally it has been shown that patients with involved groin LN without proven pelvic LN disease on imaging receive 1 of 3 management strategies in equal proportions - inguinal lymphadenectomy (IL); ilio-inguinal lymphadenectomy (I-IL); or variable use of either depending on circumstances. Different experts have strong and polarised opinions favouring either IL or more extensive I-IL with existing cases series reporting conflicting data on best cancer outcomes. No high level evidence proves which operation is best. HYPOTHESIS: There will be no significant difference in DFS between patients having IL or I-IL conditional on PET/CT scan showing no evidence of pelvic disease at the time of diagnosis of groin LN metastatic melanoma. AIMS: To provide a rational evidence base for management for melanoma to the groin LNs by randomly assessing the effect of each operation on DFS distant DFS overall survival (OS) morbidity - including early complications and longer-term rates of lymphedema as well as comprehensively assessed QOL. Also to clarify the reliability of PET/CT scans for staging pelvic LNs and evaluate any health economic benefits of I-IL over IL. TARGET POPULATION: To recruit 634 patients in 5 years.

Melanoma,Study of Nilotinib in Metastatic Melanoma With KIT Aberrations, Major response was observed to imatinib mesylate in KIT-mutated metastatic rectal melanoma (Hodi FS et al J Clin Oncol 26:2046-2051 2008). In the ASCO annual meeting in 2009ar KIT mutations were reported to be present in 23% of acral and 15.2% of mucosal melanomas (Heinrich MC et al J Clin Oncol 26:2008 abstr 9016). Nilotinib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting KIT PDGFR and Bcr-Abl and inhibiting the proliferating of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant cells in vitro. Phase I study of nilotinib alone and in combination with imatinib in patients with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) demonstrated significant activity (72% stable disease for nilotinib alone and 56% for nilotinib/imatinib combination) (Blay JY et al J Clin Oncol 26:2008 abstr 10553). Thus we propose to conduct a phase II study of nilotinib in metastatic melanoma with KIT mutations.    ,NCT01099514
Melanoma,High-Dose Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2B Ipilimumab or Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Stage III-IV High Risk Melanoma That Has Been Removed by Surgery, This randomized phase III trial studies how well high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B or ipilimumab works compared with pembrolizumab in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that has been removed by surgery but is likely to come back or spread. High-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B may help shrink or slow the growth of melanoma. Monoclonal antibodies such as ipilimumab and pembrolizumab may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. It is not yet known whether high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B or ipilimumab is more effective than pembrolizumab in treating patients with melanoma.    ,NCT02506153
Melanoma,Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Metastatic Ocular Melanoma, Background: - The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors growing them in the laboratory in large numbers and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. This study will use chemotherapy to prepare the immune system before this white blood cell treatment. After receiving the cells the drug aldesleukin (IL-2) may be given to help the cells stay alive longer. Objectives: - To see if chemotherapy and white blood cell therapy is a safe and effective treatment for advanced ocular melanoma. Eligibility: - Individuals at least greater than or equal to 16 years to less than or equal to 75 years who have advanced ocular melanoma. Design:   -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination scans x-rays lab tests and other tests as needed.   -  Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.   -  Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}   -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.   -  Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam review of side effects lab tests and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.    ,NCT01814046

Melanoma,Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes And Low-Dose Interleukin-2 Therapy Following Cyclophosphamide And Fludarabine In Patients With Melanoma, This is a phase II clinical study for patients with metastatic (the cancer has spread to other parts of the body) melanoma. Patients will receive an infusion (given by vein) of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). TILs are a type of white blood cells that recognizes tumor cells and enter them which causes the tumor cells to break down. Prior to the cell infusion patients will receive a two drugs cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to prepare the body to receive the TILs. After cell infusion patients will receive low-dose interleukin-2 therapy which is an approved drug to treat melanoma. This study will see how useful this regimen is in treating metastatic melanoma.    ,NCT01883323
Melanoma,A Phase II Study of Sunitinib Versus Dacarbazine in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Uveal Melanoma, Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma with radiotherapy or surgery. But if this cancer spreads it is more difficult to treat. Doctors usually treat uveal melanoma that has spread with a chemotherapy called dacarbazine but they are always looking to find new ways to treat uveal melanoma. This study aims to find out how well Sunitinib works to treat uveal melanoma and to see how long Sunitinib and Dacarbazine can help to prevent the cancer from getting worse.    ,NCT01551459

Pembrolizumab is an antibody that helps the immune system to attack cancer cells. Although pembrolizumab has proven clinical efficacy in treating patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma an effect on metastatic uveal melanoma has not been established. Entinostat is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that has effects on both cancer cells and immune regulatory cells thus potentially enhancing the effects of immunotherapy.    ,NCT02697630
Melanoma,Nilotinib in TKI Resistant or Intolerant Patients With Metastatic Mucosal Acral or Chronically Sun Damaged Melanoma, Given the poor prognosis and limited treatment options available for patients with mucosal or acral/lentiginous melanomas who develop metastatic disease genetic discoveries of KIT mutations in these cancers present the need to test multi-targeted kinase inhibitors with potent KIT inhibitory activity in this patient population. Imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have the potential to be effective in this patient population but patients may develop resistance to treatment. Therefore in this study we propose to test nilotinib in patients with metastatic mucosal acral or chronically sun-damaged melanoma following treatment with another TKI.    ,NCT00788775

Melanoma,PET Imaging of Patients With Melanoma and Malignant Brain Tumors Using an 124I-labeled cRGDY Silica Nanomolecular Particle Tracer: A Microdosing Study, Current tests to detect cancer including CAT scans and MRI scans are limited. PET scans use special dyes that are injected into a vein and can better localize possible cancer. The investigators have developed a new particle that can carry a radioactive dye to a very specific area of the tumor. When using a PET scan the radioactive dye can be viewed in areas of possible disease. This particle has been studied in mice and was safe. The particles will not treat the cancer and any images or information found during this study will not be used for your treatment. The information collected may be used to guide the design of future studies to detect and/or treat tumors.    ,NCT01266096

Melanoma,THE IPI - Trial in Advanced Melanoma: Melanoma Patients With Advanced Disease," This is an open-label multi-center single-arm clinical phase II study to further characterize the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab in patients with or without systemic pretreatment metastatic ocular melanoma. The DeCOG-MM-PAL11-Trial will be continued only for patients with ocular melanoma because sufficient numbers of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma patients have already been recruited. In order to allow the separate subgroup analysis as planned in the protocol for ocular melanoma it is mandatory to focus the recruitment to this patient population. Only this will guarantee a valid evaluation of all cohorts. Ocular melanoma is defined as melanomas originated from uvea the choroid the ciliary body and conjunctiva. (see McCartney ACE ""Pathology of ocular melanomas"" British Medical Bulltta 1995 Vol 51 No 3 pp 678-693) The same criteria and treatment procedure as those used before will be applied for the patients with advanced ocular melanoma. Since no treatment standard in those patients does exist also patients without prior systemic treatment can be included in this study. Therefore the 5th inclusion criterion has been adapted in order to enrol the eligible patients.    ",NCT01355120
Melanoma,The Role of Inflammation in Ocular Tumours, This prospective non-therapeutic study will determine whether a novel imaging technique can identify presumptive tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) in patients with ocular tumours. In this study we will modify the standard angiography protocol by having patients return twice in the week following angiography for additional photographs. Photographs will be obtained 2-7 days after angiography but without further injection of dye. This technique contrasts with normal angiography in which photographs are taken during the transit phase of dye circulation and in the minutes thereafter. Of note both the dye and the cameras used for its detection have been approved for clinical use for several decades and are routinely used in the evaluation of patients with ocular tumours. We will evaluate 5 groups:   1. Choroidal nevus (low-risk features): requires distinction from melanoma through diagnostic testing   2. Choroidal indeterminate melanocytic lesion (high-risk features): requires diagnostic testing for identification and distinction from nevus and melanoma   3. Choroidal melanoma: requires confirmation of diagnosis and evaluation for potential metatstases   4. Suspected metastatic tumour (ie primary tumour elsewhere): requires identification of primary tumour   5. Locally treated ocular tumours: requires followup to evaluate response to treatment and potential change or repeat therapy    ,NCT02909517

X-ACT treatment involves removing a participant's lymph node(s) close to a melanoma tumor. These lymph nodes contain special kind of cells (called T cells) which can be activated (getting the cells to start up certain responses in the immune system) outside of the body in an approved laboratory. The activated T cells are then injected back into the same participant using an i.v. to help the participant's immune system to target melanoma. The participant will undergo regular blood testing to determine whether the X-ACT treatment has resulted in changes to the immune system and also whether the T cells which were given back to the patient persist in the blood stream over time. In addition the effect of the X-ACT treatment on the growth or shrinkage of the participant's melanoma will be measured.    ,NCT02327390
Melanoma,Disulfiram in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Melanoma remains a malignancy that is largely resistant to chemotherapy. Metastatic disease responds poorly to the treatments used today with only 2 out of 30 drugs tested DTIC and nitrosoureas showing response rates greater than 10% and complete responses are rare. DTIC-based regimen has been recognized as a standard chemotherapy for advanced melanoma and temozolomide demonstrated efficacy equal to that of DTIC and is an oral alternative agent that also crosses the blood brain barrier. Randomized phase III trials have shown no survival benefit of adding other agents (cisplatin BCNU and tamoxifen). Biochemotherapy is being developed extensively with moderate improvement in the responsive rate (approximately 50%) and is under evaluation in randomized trial to identify whether there is survival benefit to this strategy compared with chemotherapy alone. Recently a randomized phase III study comparing chemotherapy (cisplatin dacarbazine and tamoxifen) with biochemotherapy (the same chemotherapy regimen plus high-dose IL-2 and interferon alfa) have shown 44% response rate for biochemotherapy vs. 27% for chemotherapy. However the tendency toward an increased response rate in patients who received biochemotherapy did not translate into an increase in overall survival and there was in fact a trend for a survival advantage in patients receiving chemotherapy alone (median survival: 10.7 vs 15.8 months). New agents (or combinations) need to be developed for this refractory malignancy. The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate and evaluate the toxicity of disulfiram (DSF) in the treatment of Stage IV melanoma. The advantages of using DSF in this phase I/II trial are the following:   -  DSF has been used as a drug for many years for the treatment of alcoholism. Its mechanism pharmacokinetics toxicity/tolerable dose are well known and this drug is relatively non-toxic by itself at therapeutic dose. Doses of greater than 3000mg/m2 can cause reversible confusion.   -  DSF can be taken orally; therefore it is convenient to administer.   -  DSF can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (unlike dacarbazine and many other chemotherapy agents); therefore it might have an active effect on CNS metastasis. This study is designed to include women and minorities but is not designed to measure differences of intervention effect.    ,NCT00256230

Melanoma,A Safety Study of Two Intratumoural Doses of Coxsackievirus Type A21 in Melanoma Patients, The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of two doses of Coxsackievirus A21 administered 48 hours apart into a superficial melanoma tumour. Injected and non-injected tumours will be observed regarding change in tumour size. Coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21) is a naturally occurring virus that is known to cause self limiting upper respiratory infections. CVA21 has been shown in cell culture to infect and kill human melanoma cancer cell lines. This property of CVA21 is due to the specific receptors CVA21 uses in order to attach to and infect a cell. The 2 receptors CVA21 uses to infect a cell are Intracellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and Decay Accelerating Factor. Both of these surface proteins are expressed on melanoma cell lines as well as human melanoma tumours. Animal models of human melanoma tumours have demonstrated that CVA21 injection either intratumour or intravenous causes infection in the tumours resulting in reduction of tumour size and growth.    ,NCT00438009
Melanoma,Autologous Dendritic Cell-Tumor Cell Immunotherapy for Metastatic Melanoma," The purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell therapy. This research study is evaluating if a patient-specific experimental therapy for metastatic melanoma will lengthen survival with minimal harmful effects. It is called an experimental therapy (or ""study therapy"") because it is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This research study will use the patient's own tumor cellsthe patient's own dendritic cells (a type of immune cell) and a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF a type of growth factor). GM-CSF is a natural growth factor that stimulates growth of white blood cells in the body. Since 1991 GM-CSF has been used as a standard treatment to help increase the number of white blood cells after chemotherapy. The patient's dendritic cells are grown in a test-tube with the patient's tumor cells and the growth factor. The resulting solution is called the study therapy. The intent of the study therapy is to make the dendritic cells more effective at fighting the tumor when they are injected back into the patient.    ",NCT01875653

Melanoma,Efficacy of Propranolol Treatment to Prevent Melanoma Progression, Melanoma's incidence is increasing worldwide. The efforts made in melanoma screening led to an earlier detection of the primary tumour and a better prognosis but melanoma remains an aggressive cancer when it comes to its metastatic stage. Three recent retrospective studies compared groups of patients diagnosed with primary melanoma and treated with betablockers for another indication to patients who never received betablockers. In these three studies the outcome of the disease is significantly better for people under betablocker treatment with a decreased rate of recurrence and a better 5 years survival rate. Here we want to investigate the efficacy and the tolerability of an adjuvant treatment with propranolol for patients suffering from a primary melanoma with a high risk of recurrence.    ,NCT01988831

Melanoma,Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Transfected Dendritic Cell Vaccination in High Risk Uveal Melanoma Patients, 1. Rationale Immunotherapy applying ex vivo generated and tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DC) has now successfully been introduced in the clinic. A limited but consistent number of objective immunological and clinical responses have been observed. Most of the successful results have been observed in patients with minimal residual disease rather than patients with advanced metastatic disease. Moreover the investigators' preliminary results show that presence of tumor epitope specific T cells in biopsies taken from delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction sites highly correlates with prolonged progression free survival (PFS). Within uveal melanoma patients a group with high risk of metastatic disease can be identified on basis of tumor specific genetic changes in loss of chromosome 3. At present no standard adjuvant or systemic treatment is available. Applying DC-based immunotherapy in this group of high risk patients might reduce the risk of recurrence without interference in the current treatment guidelines.   2. Objectives In this joint clinical study of Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RUNMC) and Rotterdam Eye Hospital the investigators aim to determine the in vivo immunological response induced in high risk uveal melanoma patients vaccinated with mRNA-transfected DC.   3. Study design This study is an open label non-randomized phase II intervention study.   4. Study population The investigators' study population consists of HLA-A2 positive patients with a high risk uveal melanoma with proven expression of melanoma associated antigens tyrosinase and/or gp100.   5. Main study endpoints This is an exploratory study aiming to demonstrate proof of principle. The first study endpoints are in vivo immunological response induced in high risk uveal melanoma patients vaccinated with mRNA-transfected DC administered i.v./i.d. and toxicity. Secondary study endpoints are progression free survival overall survival and toxicity.    ,NCT00929019

It will also track outcomes or the uveal melanoma population that received DecisionDx-UM testing.    ,NCT02376920
Melanoma,Intravitreal Ranibizumab for the Prevention of Radiation Maculopathy Following Plaque Radiotherapy, Uveal Melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adulthood. Eye preserving treatments can deliver equivalent life prognosis in the management of small and medium sized uveal melanomas as compared to enucleation. Plaque radiotherapy has emerged as the most common eye-preserving treatment in the current management of uveal melanoma but is complicated by visual loss in approximately 70% of patients at 10 years follow-up. Strategies for the prevention and early treatment of radiation retinopathy/maculopathy need to be developed to improve visual outcomes following plaque treatment. Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is the antigen binding fragment of a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody which inhibits the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor A a mediator in the development of choroidal neovascularization. Lucentis is commonly used in the eye for eye conditions such as age related macular degeneration. This study will investigate the possible benefit of Anti-VEGF therapy (Lucentis) in reducing the incidence of radiation complications following plaque radiation for uveal melanoma.    ,NCT00540930
Melanoma,A Study of Sorafenib in Patients With Chemonaive Metastatic Uveal Melanoma, Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intra-ocular malignancy in adults with an incidence of 0.6 - 0.7 per 100000 per year. Prognosis of metastatic uveal melanoma is poor. In retrospective analyses a median survival time after detection of metastases of 5 months (Flaherty et al 1998) and 7 months (Kath et al 1993) was reported. For patients receiving no treatment reported median survival was 2.0 months compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (Gragoudas et al 1991). Up to now there is no established treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma. Some therapeutic approaches with locoregional treatment or systemic chemotherapy have been undertaken: In case of metastatic disease which is confined to the liver in about 85% of patients with uveal melanoma surgical resection led to a median survival of 14 months (Mariani et al 2009) or 19 months and a 5-year survival rate of 22% in a selected patient population (Adam et al 2006). As locoregional treatment option treatment with fotemustine via direct intra-arterial hepatic infusion was investigated and led to a median survival of 15 months (Peters et al 2006). This was not a randomized trial but a report on 101 consecutive treated patients. Additional debulking surgery was performed whenever feasible. A randomized phase III trial comparing intra-arterial hepatic fotemustine administration with intravenous systemic fotemustine and overall survival as primary endpoint is still ongoing (EORTC 18021). Thus no systemic chemotherapy is approved for metastatic uveal melanoma. Although no specific genes have been linked to the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma preclinical studies suggest potential benefit of inhibitors of Bcl-2 ubiquitin-proteasome histone deactylase mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-AKT pathways and receptor tyrosine kinases. Thus sorafenib as inhibitor of b-Raf and Raf-1 (c-Raf or c-Raf-1) pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) may potentially lead to a benefit for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in terms of disease control and prolongation of survival.    ,NCT01377025
Melanoma,Assessing the Clinical Effectiveness of Serum Biomarkers in the Diagnosis of Metastatic Uveal Melanoma, Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adults. The local treatment is effective but patients still die of metastatic disease. It has been shown that early diagnosis of a few isolated metastases can result in a clean surgical excision of the metastases and an extension of the expected survival from 7-12 months to over 10 years on some patients. Many serum biomarkers are employed in Oncology. It makes sense to try the relevant ones in the diagnosis of metastatic uveal melanoma. The investigators hypothesis is that a soluble serum biomarker level changes upon development of metastatic disease either by secretion by the tumor cells themselves or by their environment. Detection of changes in biomarker level may lead to the diagnosis of metastases before they can be detected by imaging modalities thus allowing for early treatment of the metastases and a better chance of success.    ,NCT01438658

Prostate Cancer,Cooking Class Intervention Project for Men With Prostate Cancer and Their Partners, Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in Canada with 24000 new cases estimated for 2015. Prostate cancer patients often live with uncomfortable side effects of treatment such as a decrease in bone health weight gain and challenges to their interpersonal relationships. Nutrition can improve outcomes for PCa survivors; however dietary interventions for prostate cancer patients are limited. Therefore this is a feasibility study that tests the impact of an innovative intervention to promote healthy nutrition and weight control for prostate cancer survivors and their partners. The objectives are to assess the feasibility of the intervention specifically:   -  Accrual retention and adherence and participant satisfaction   -  Candidate measures for primary outcomes in future studies The intent is to evaluate how well the classes work and identify ways to make them more successful. At the end of the study the investigators will know if this approach shows merit to be tested further through a randomized controlled trial.    ,NCT02954289
Prostate Cancer,PROstaTe Cancer - Exercise-STudy (PRO-TEST), Background and purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of exercise on intratumoral natural killer (NK)-cell variability in patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. The primary hypothesis is that exercise induces epinephrine-mediated intratumoral natural killer (NK)-cell infiltration in patients with localized prostate cancer and that the infiltration is greater in patients performing High Intensity Interval Training compared to moderate intensity training. Currently there is a lack of randomized controlled trials examining different types of exercise in patients with localized prostate cancer. Moreover there is a need for studies including biological measurements to allow a full assessment of the effect of exercise on diverse biomarkers and mechanistic pathways which may influence cancer survival. Subjects: Patients with histologically verified prostate adenocarcinoma scheduled for radical prostatectomy at Urologic Department Rigshospitalet Copenhagen Denmark. Methods: In this randomized controlled pilot study 30 patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy will be included and randomized to either High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) exercise intervention Moderate-Intensity Aerobic Exercise and Resistance Training (MI-AT+RT) intervention (standard recommendations) or observational control receiving usual care for a total period of 8 weeks. All patients will undergo assessments at inclusion (baseline) and after 8 weeks (5-7 days prior to surgery) respectively. Assessments include: anthropometrics; blood pressure; resting hearth rate; cardiorespiratory fitness by cardiopulmonary exercise test (VO2 peak.); body composition by DXA scan; quality of life by self-report questionnaires; oral glucose tolerance test; fasting blood sample measuring cholesterol triglycerides insulin c-peptide HbA1c glucose hormones and inflammatory markers. Also the investigators will collect blood samples before during and after an acute exercise bout in order to explore the acute systemic changes in exercise-regulated biomarkers. Biological tissue from tumor (primary prostate biopsies) will be retrieved from the respective local pathological departments and from the perioperative prostate specimen and sent to protocol analyses.    ,NCT02954783

Prostate Cancer,A Phase Ib Study of Intravenous Copper Loading With Oral Disulfiram in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and optimal dosing of intravenous copper chloride and disulfiram in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Eligible men will have neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) adenocarcinoma CRPC with non-liver/peritoneal metastases (lymph nodes bone or lung) or adenocarcinoma CRPC with liver and/or peritoneal metastases. Subjects will receive three doses of intravenous copper chloride and take disulfiram and oral copper gluconate until disease progression (up to two years). Subjects will also undergo a PET scan with radioactive copper 64 to measure the levels of copper in their tumor. The central hypotheses of this project are that (a) copper chloride and disulfiram are safe to give together and that (b) the combination of disulfiram with copper will have efficacy for both mCRPC and NEPC.    ,NCT02963051

Prostate Cancer,Assess Gamma H2AX Positivity in Circulating Prostate Cancer Cells Before and After Radium 223, This is a prospective biomarker study on prostate cancer patients receiving Radium 223 as standard of care. Participants will take part in this research study because they have chosen Radium 223 treatment for their prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and causing pain. Investigators want to find out if a blood test performed before and after the Radium 223 treatment will help to understand how prostate cancer cells react to this therapy. In this pilot study researchers want to find out if Radium 223 given as part of standard treatment for prostate cancer can decrease the number of circulating prostate cancer cells. Radium 223 kills prostate cancer cells by damaging their DNA. Other than looking at the changes in the number of circulating prostate cancer cells before and after Radium 223 researchers would also like to look at the changes in a DNA damage marker called gamma H2AX in the circulating prostate cancer cells before and after treatment with Radium 223. Assessing the DNA damage marker gamma H2AX is investigational. It is performed in the same tube of blood that is used for assessing the changes in the number of circulating prostate cancer cells.    ,NCT02981797

Prostate Cancer,Collection and Measurement of Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy Patients, Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men and nearly 30000 deaths occur from the disease each year. Not only is there significant mortality there is also considerable morbidity from primary and salvage therapies. Understanding which patients require intensified treatment as well as those who might not require treatment would improve outcomes on multiple levels. The cohort to be investigated will be comprised of men with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer who are candidates for radiotherapy (RT). The overarching objective of the CoMBINe trial is to identify pretreatment and post-treatment prognostic and predictive factors derived from quantitative imaging prostate features tumor tissue gene expression signatures and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The CoMBINe trial is a sister trial to another study termed BLaStM (IRB# 20140627) in men who are candidates for radiotherapy. CoMBINe also allows for men with oligometastasis who are sometimes treated with RT to the prostate and limited metastatic sites.    ,NCT02997709
Prostate Cancer,PSMA PET/CT in Prostate Cancer, The objectives of this study are to replicate the safety and efficacy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and as a diagnostic and decision making tool in the management prostate cancer patients.The primary endpoints of the study are the incidence of adverse events (AE) in the study population up to 7 days following the scan and the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT vs CT on a per-patient and per-lesion basis.    ,NCT03001869
Prostate Cancer,Correlation Between SUV on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and Gleason Score in Prostate Cancer, Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a unique membrane bound glycoprotein which is overexpressed manifold on prostate cancer cells and is well-characterized as an imaging biomarker of prostate cancer. Positron emission tomography / computer tomography (PET/CT) is a nuclear medicine procedure based on the measurement of positron emission from radiolabeled tracer molecules. 18F-DCFPyL is a tracer for prostate cancer PET imaging which binds to PSMA. The strength of functional imaging methods is in distinguishing tissues according to metabolism rather than structure. Studies have shown that PET/CT imaging with 18F-DCFPyL can detect prostate cancer lesions with excellent contrast and a high detection rate even when the level of prostate specific antigen is low. The objective of this study is to evaluate if the patient-wide SUVmax on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in locoregional and metastatic prostate cancer correlates with histopathologic Gleason score at initial biopsy. It is hypothesized that SUVmax will correlate positively with Gleason score. This is of interest because non-invasive risk stratification may be possible in the future.    ,NCT03001895
Prostate Cancer,Trial of Rad-223 Activity in Asymptomatic Patients With mCRPC While on Abiraterone or Enzalutamide Besides AR-V7 Status, Radium-223 is indicated for the treatment of patients with mCRPC with symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease. However very few data have been reported in patients with mCRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Recently results from an International Expanded Access Program have also suggested a benefit of radium-223 in asymptomatic patients with mCRPC. In addition the mechanism of action of radium-223 should not be correlated with the presence/absence of the AR-V7 mutation although this issue has not yet been evaluated. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of radium-223 in asymptomatic patients with mCRPC and to establish the association between AR-V7 status and radium-223 activity.    ,NCT03002220

Prostate Cancer,Robotic Surgery After Focal Ablation Therapy, The toxicity of traditional prostate cancer therapies including radical surgery and external beam radiation is well known. This has prompted a move towards focal therapy where only the cancerous part of the prostate is treated. To date studies have demonstrated very promising outcomes following focal therapy with the majority of men maintaining their urinary and sexual function after therapy. In a small proportion of men disease recurs after focal therapy. The optimal treatment for men with recurrent disease after focal therapy is yet to be defined. Patients may undergo further focal therapy to the recurrent disease undergo radiation therapy whole-gland therapy using a minimally invasive approach such as High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) or cryotherapy. Alternatively patients may undergo radical surgery where the whole prostate is removed. To date the side-effects or toxicity of any treatment for recurrent prostate cancer after focal therapy has not been formally studied. Traditionally the side effects of surgery and radiation therapy performed in patients that have already undergone previous prostate cancer treatment have been considerable with high rates of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. However as focal therapy leaves a significant area of the prostate untreated the investigators believe surgery after focal prostate therapy will be associated with a much lower incidence of urinary and sexual dysfunction. The aim of the RAFT study is to characterise the side effects of prostate cancer surgery in men that have undergone prior focal ablation therapy. In addition the investigators wish to perform a number of basic science studies to attempt to better understand why the patient has experienced recurrent prostate cancer after focal therapy.    ,NCT03011606

Prostate Cancer,PC 360 Survivorship, Prostate Cancer Survivorship 360Âº is a collaboration-based initiative involving prostate cancer (PC) and survivorship researchers/clinicians from three Canadian prostate centers with the goal of identifying and tracking unmet supportive care needs of patients with localized PC and responding to these needs through survivorship care. The current randomized control trail (RCT) will focus on the development and evaluation of a facilitated electronic Prostate Cancer Survivorship Care Plan (PC-SCP). The aims of this project are: 1) to develop an appropriate and tailored SCP and transition care delivery process; and 2) to conduct an RCT to evaluate whether a personalized PC SCP intervention is more effective than usual care (UC) on patient activation (primary outcome) and access to services self-Management support satisfaction with information HRQoL and cancer worry (secondary outcomes). Data from a multi-site prospective database- Prostate Cancer Survivorship Information System (PC360-IS) will be used to electronically populate the survivorship care plans. Overall this proposal represents initial steps in uniting the country in sharing programmatic resources data expertise and enthusiasm to transform survivorship care for men with PC and their families.    ,NCT03017456
Prostate Cancer,Evaluation of Neuroendocrine Differentiation as a Potential Mechanism of Tumor Recurrence Following Radiotherapy in Prostate Carcinoma, This is a pilot study to test a hypothesis that a greater increase in serum chromogranin A (CgA) after a definitive radiotherapy (RT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer recurrence after RT. Serum CgA level is measured before the start of RT and/or the start of neoadjuvant ADT for patients undergoing a definitive RT with or without ADT. CgA is also measured at various pre-defined post-RT time points. The study will analyze the followings: 1. Change in CgA level at various pre-defined post-RT time points from the baseline 2. Correlation between the extent of post-therapy CgA change and Gleason score of malignancy 3. Correlation between the extent of post-therapy CgA change and treatment outcome.    ,NCT03017794
Prostate Cancer,Explaining the Invisible, Radiotherapy uses high doses of x-rays directed at tumours to kill them an unfortunate side effect is healthy surrounding tissue will receive some of the x-ray dose and is damaged. Approximately 22% of radiotherapy patients receive treatment to cure prostate cancer. The technique used requires patients to maintain full bladder and empty bowel because they are next to the prostate the aim of radiotherapy planning is to minimise the radiation dose received to healthy organs and tissues as this will reduce side effects. PEARL is commercial interactive PC software that shows realistic and functional 3D models of Linac's (machines that deliver radiotherapy treatment). Using PEARL it's possible to display realistic patient treatments including how an individual would be laid on a treatment couch and how the machine will move and sound during treatment. Additionally PEARL provides the opportunity to look inside the body to view internal anatomy and show where the radiotherapy treatment is directed. Information prior to treatment in radiotherapy is normally given verbally one to one. The investigators believe this information can be more easily understood if PEARL is used in conjunction with this verbal exchange. PEARL gives visual and audio representation of the treatment experience and demonstrates the reasons behind required preparations. Research aim is to demonstrate patients who receive information using PEARL have greater understanding reduced anxiety and reduced radiation dose. This will be tested using two groups of patients receiving radiotherapy to the prostate. Group A - Verbal information Group B - Verbal information and PEARL demonstration. Data collection is via patient questionnaires and review of Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT) images that are taken prior to each radiotherapy treatment as standard practice. CBCT's are used to locate the treatment area and assess bladder and bowel status and ensure all of these are suitable to deliver treatment accurately.    ,NCT03025633

Prostate Cancer,Nivolumab in Prostate Cancer With Mutations in DNA Repair Defects (ImmunoProst Trial), Prostate Cancer (PC) is the most frequent cancer in men accounting for 21% of new cases of cancer in men in the United States. Among the four most incident tumors (breast lung and colorectal cancer); prostate cancer is the only that does not have any predictive biomarker to guide the treatment. Even though the molecular heterogeneity of PC is well-documented treatment has not been molecularly stratified and the need for genetic prognostic and predictive markers is critical. DNA repair defects (DRD) mainly in the Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway (such as BRCA1 BRCA2 ATM and CHEK2) are emerging as potential biomarkers in prostate cancer. It is well known BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers have better Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) than non-carriers in ovarian cancer. Differently than ovarian tumors that BRCA mutations provides a good prognosis PC patients who harbor HR defects have a higher Gleason score 6 an increased risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. The predictive role of DRD in PC was demonstrated in a recent trial using Olaparib a PARP inhibitor in DRD carriers. This trial showed 88% of response rate with Olaparib a PARP inhibitor that acts in HR pathway by synthetic lethality. Recent data demonstrated important association between HR deficient high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) high neoantigen load and high expression of PD-1/PD-L1 compared with HR proficient HGSOCs 10. This study showed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations increase the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and confer a better prognosis. The unprecedented success of immunotherapy in malignant disorders has provided evidence that the patient's immune system can be improved to attack established tumors mainly melanoma non-small cell lung cancer and kidney cancer. A high mutational burden increases the likelihood of the development of specific neoepitopes that would confer clinical benefit from CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade. These data showed that specific DNA repair defects increase the mutational burden the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and TILs; and could improve the response to immunotherapy in cancer. This rationale was already tested in a trial that evaluated the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor Pembrolizumab in mismatch-repair deficient patients a kind of DNA repair defect by definition. This important trial showed that this DRD predicted clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade in many types of cancer especially colorectal cancer.    ,NCT03040791

Prostate Cancer,Cohorts of Docetaxel or Cabazitaxel in Combination With the Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitor Clarithromycin, This clinical trial is being conducted to recommend a safe and tolerable phase 2 dose of docetaxel or cabazitaxel when combined with clarithromycin in men who have developed castrate-resistant prostate cancer. In the castrate-resistant setting resistance to taxane therapy inevitably develops. Men who develop resistance to taxanes have a very poor prognosis and few treatment options. It is believed that CYP enzymes contribute to docetaxel and cabazitaxel resistance in metastatic prostate cancer and this resistance can be mitigated through pharmacologic CYP inhibition. In this study a potent CYP3A inhibitor clarithromycin will be co-administered concurrently with either docetaxel or cabazitaxel whose systemic metabolism is dependent of CYP3A4 with the intent to overcome resistance to taxanes.    ,NCT03043989
Prostate Cancer,Discerning Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Transperineal Targeted Biopsy Compared to Standard Transrectal Biopsy, Prostate biopsies are currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Many biopsies however are unnecessary or cannot detect significant prostate cancer (PCa). With multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) we now potentially have a way of increasing the detection of detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) while decreasing the detection of non-significant PCa. The goals and the objective of this study are as follows keeping this in mind.    ,NCT03044197

With the aim to improve the urinary continence recovery after robotic prostatectomy we evaluate the impact of the use of a 6-branch retropubic suburethral autologous sling created and placed during the procedure in association with intraoperative evaluation of the retrograde leak point pressure by means of retrograde perfusion sphincterometry for proper sling tensioning.    ,NCT03050996
Prostate Cancer,Trial of ADT and SBRT Versus SBRT for Intermediate Prostate Cancer, Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a very precise form of radiation therapy that allows the physician to deliver more radiation dose in a single session. Because of this the number of radiation sessions can be reduced from the typical 45-48 sessions as in conventional daily session radiation to 5 sessions given every other day over a week and a half. Giving the radiation at a higher dose during each treatment may be more effective in killing the prostate cancer cells than the standard way of using external radiation therapy where a small amount of radiation is given over many sessions. Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) or hormonal therapy is one of the methods to treat intermediate risk prostate cancer. This therapy works by reducing the level of testosterone and stopping them from affecting your cancer. The ADT used in this study is known as Degarelix. Degarelix is an approved medication that reduces the body's production of testosterone; this medication is usually given to all men with intermediate risk prostate cancer getting external radiation. This study is a randomized study to find out whether combining stereotactic (also known as precision) radiation to the prostate cancer combined with a short course of Degarelix will result in a greater likelihood of killing the cancer in the prostate compared to stereotactic radiation therapy given alone. It has been shown that the combination of radiation with medications that interfere with testosterone production and its effects makes prostate cancer cells more sensitive to the radiation.    ,NCT03056638

Prostate Cancer,The IMPACT Study - Identification of Men With a Genetic Predisposition to ProstAte Cancer, The IMPACT study is an international targeted prostate screening study of men at increased prostate cancer risk due to the presence of known pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. There are only approximately 150 men with a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation in the UK. Research has shown that these men are at an increased risk of developing prostate cancer but more information is needed about the pathogenesis of prostate cancer in this defined group and the role of screening in these men. The study will offer annual PSA screening to these men to determine the incidence of prostate cancer in this group. The study will also look at new markers of early prostate cancer in this cohort. The power calculations for this study are 850 carriers and 850 controls (age-matched men without BRCA1/2 mutations). It is therefore essential to gain international collaboration to meet the target of recruiting 850 men with these known mutations and a control group of 850 men who have tested negative for a known familial mutation.    ,NCT00261456

Prostate Cancer,Prehabilitation for Prostate Cancer Surgery, Radical prostatectomy is the most common and effective treatment for localized prostate cancer. Unfortunately radical prostatectomy is associated with significant adverse effects such as urinary incontinence sexual dysfunction and reduced physical function that collectively diminish health-related quality of life which may persist for up to two years postoperatively. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the feasibility of conducting of a multi-site randomized controlled trial to test the effect of a comprehensive prehabilitation program versus standard care for men with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. We hypothesize that men with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy in the comprehensive prehabilitation program (full-body exercises and pelvic floor muscle exercises) will report better health-related quality of life urological symptoms and physical fitness physical activity and pain as well as a shorter postoperative length of stay than participants receiving standard preoperative care (pelvic floor muscle exercises alone). Our secondary objective is to report estimates of efficacy on several clinically important outcomes for this population that will be used for sample size calculations in an adequately powered trial.    ,NCT02036684
Prostate Cancer,Advanced Pelvic Floor Training Program for Prostate Cancer Surgery, Radical prostatectomy is a common and effective treatment for prostate cancer but is associated with urinary incontinence that can persist for several months after surgery and significantly reduce quality of life. Studies have shown that routine performance of pelvic floor exercises after radical prostatectomy can aid in the recovery of urinary control; however conventional pelvic floor exercises do not produce consistent results. Research indicates that incorporating other deep abdominal muscles can further activate the pelvic floor making it stronger than by activating the pelvic floor alone. Specifically 'Pfilates' and 'Hypopressives' are two new techniques that combine traditional pelvic floor exercises with activation of supportive muscles. Our proposed study will be the first to test the effect of an advanced pelvic floor exercise training program that includes Pfilates and Hypopressives to treat urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy. Our primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale RCT of an advanced pelvic floor exercise training program including standard pelvic floor exercises Pfilates and Hypopressives techniques on urinary incontinence. Feasibility will be determined by measuring recruitment success retention outcome capture and intervention adherence tolerance and safety. We hypothesize men under going radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in the advance pelvic floor training program will report greater improvement in urinary incontinence and health-related quality of life.    ,NCT02233608
Prostate Cancer,Identifying Prostate Brachytherapy Seeds Using MRI, This study will look at the feasibility of using a type of Magnetic Resonance Imaging called Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) to detect your implanted radioactive seeds.

Prostate Cancer,Pilot Study of Whole Gland Salvage HDR Prostate Brachytherapy for Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer, Radiation therapy is considered a standard treatment option for the management of localized prostate cancer. Among the 20-30% of patients who recur there is no consensus on the optimal salvage therapy. Salvage options available for isolated local recurrence include; temporary or permanent implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate complete removal of the prostate gland use of low temperatures to treat the disease (cryotherapy) and high frequency ultrasound to treat the disease. There are risks of complications associated with all these treatments and there is presently no consensus as to which treatment is the best. The aim of this pilot study is to look at the feasibility and toxicities of whole gland salvage treatment of the prostate using temporary implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate.    ,NCT02560181
Prostate Cancer,PET-MR-PSA Prostate Cancer Recidive Study, Simultaneous PET/MRI has the potential to improve the detection accuracy in recurrent prostate cancer since it combines the excellent soft-tissue contrast of MRI with the high molecular sensitivity of PET in a single imaging session.

Prostate Cancer,Salvage Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer Patients With Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy, Despite continuous technical improvements in urologic surgery up to 40% of prostate cancer patients will develop biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) potentially because of micro metastasis at the time of the primary surgery. With improved radiological modalities and nuclear medicine tracers like 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT which allow the localization of the site of recurrence there is increasing interest in metastasis directed therapies such as salvage lymph node dissection. The pelvic extended salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) is a promising option for treating prostate cancer patients with local recurrence after radical prostatectomy with curative intent. Several retrospective series has been published to determine the local value of sLND. Despite the first data seem to be feasible and promising to date no prospective evaluation has been made. Thus sLND is still experimental according to the guidelines and is considered as an off label therapy. This prospective single center phase I/II study was conducted to investigate the safety and early efficacy of salvage lymph node dissection in prostate cancer patients with local pelvic recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) with curative intention.    ,NCT02974075
Prostate Cancer,A Pragmatic Trial of the Effect of a Mailed Patient Flyer About Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Testing Prior to an Annual Exam, 1. Does a one-page American College of Physicians educational flyer about the pros and cons of prostate cancer screening sent to men within two weeks of their scheduled annual health examinations in a general medicine clinic result in a different rate of prostate cancer screening than among men who were not sent the flyer?   2. Do patients find the flyer useful and understandable? Context: The use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer is controversial because of a lack of evidence that such screening saves lives when applied within a population and because such testing can lead to invasive downstream biopsies and aggressive treatment that is associated with a high risk of permanent side effects (e.g. impotence incontinence). Almost all professional societies (American Cancer Society American Urologic Association American College of Physicians United States Preventive Services Task Force) advocate that patients receive education and complete an informed decision-making discussion with their medical providers about the pros and cons of the PSA test as well as their personal preferences before proceeding with this test. Unfortunately despite these recommendations there is seldom sufficient time during clinic visits to achieve this goal.    ,NCT01516801

Prostate Cancer,Phase 2 Study of G-202 in Patients With Chemotherapy-NaÃ¯ve Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer that has returned after local treatment usually responds to hormone blocking treatment but most patients eventually experience disease progression. Further chemotherapy does not normally lead to a cure or dramatic improvement in the disease and there is a need to identify new drugs that are beneficial for these patients without unacceptable side effects. Prodrug chemotherapy is an approach in which an inactive non-toxic agent is administered to the patient and gets activated within the body at specific locations resulting in a higher concentration of the cytotoxic form at a tumour location whilst avoiding general side effects. G-202 is an example of prodrug chemotherapy. It does not have many general side effects because it is converted to a cell toxin only at the tumour or other specific locations in the body. G-202 is activated by Prostate Specific Memory Antigen (PSMA) a substance expressed by prostate cancer cells and in the blood vessels of most solid tumours but not by normal cells or blood vessels in normal tissue. It is believed that activation of the prodrug G-202 will allow the drug to kill cancer cells particularly prostate cancer cells. This study will evaluate the activity and safety of G-202 in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which means the cancer has progressed after hormone blocking treatment but who have not yet received chemotherapy and who have no or only a few symptoms from their CRPC. The study will evaluate clinical activity and safety of G-202 administered on three consecutive days of a 28-day cycle.    ,NCT01734681
Prostate Cancer,FACBC Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography(PET/CT) Used in the Diagnosis of Primary Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this research project is to test if a compound (chemical substance) has a natural tendency to go to prostate cancer. This compound has a small amount of radioactivity attached to it and is called a radiotracer. The name of the radiotracer is FACBC and can be detected on a special imaging device called a PET scanner (positron emission tomography). The radiotracer is treated in the body much like an amino acid which is a nutrient required for normal functioning. Tumors also use these nutrients. Earlier studies have shown that this radiotracer may be able to detect prostate cancer. The investigators will perform a study with 20 patients in whom they know have prostate cancer after a biopsy and who are scheduled for an operation in which the prostate is removed and the nearby lymph nodes are examined. This operation is called prostatectomy. The investigators think that this radiotracer can help us determine where exactly the prostate cancer is present in the prostate or if it has spread. This information may be useful in the future to help with other non-surgical therapy such as radiation beam therapy. The investigators will compare the results of the FACBC PET scan to the results of the pathology analysis of the removed prostate. In this way the investigators can determine how good a test FACBC PET is for finding out where and if prostate cancer is located in the prostate or nearby lymph nodes. The investigators will also do more advanced analysis on the biopsy samples to see if they can tell why FACBC goes into prostate cancer cells. This radiotracer has been tested in over 100 human subjects without incident. It has also been chosen by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a promising radiotracer. The NIH is funding this study.    ,NCT00917865

Prostate Cancer,Study of Metformin With Simvastatin for Men With Prostate Carcinoma, The purpose of this study is to find out whether the two drugs used in the study metformin and simvastatin can slow down the speed of rise of prostate specific antigen (PSA) or stop its rise or even bring the level down. Recently scientists noticed that men who take metformin to treat their high blood sugar or simvastatin to treat their high cholesterol are less likely to develop prostate cancer. Also scientists found that when these drugs are used in preclinical studies they can slow down the growth of the prostate cancer cells. This study will try to find out whether these drugs can actually slow down the growth of prostate cancer in men.    ,NCT01561482
Prostate Cancer,Preoperative Staging and Dose Escalated Radiotherapy of Prostate Carcinoma With PET and MRI, Prostate cancer (PCa) is currently the most common neoplastic disease among men in well-developed countries with 350 000 new cases diagnosed annually in Europe and 4 800 in Finland. Due to widespread use of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) in asymptomatic men most patients present initially with localized disease. Radical prostatectomy radiotherapy (RT) and active surveillance are the most common management options for patients with localized PCa. Proper preoperative staging for patients with adverse features on biopsy who are candidates for radical prostatectomy is urgently needed. For elderly men external beam RT is the preferred modality which can be safely performed utilizing modern techniques such as intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy (IMRT and IGRT). Since randomized studies suggest a dose response effect beyond 78-80 Gy newer techniques aim at dose escalation provided that toxicity can be controlled. Therefore ultra high dose IMRT/IGRT requires visualization of intracapsular disease which will receive the highest dose. Taken together the use of accurate anatomical and functional imaging modalities are essential for planning both nerve sparing radical prostatectomy and ultra high dose IMRT/IGRT Fluorine-18 labeled L-leucine analogue 1-amino-3-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (FACBC) has shown to preferentially accumulate in PCa and its nodal metastases. By assisting in localization of intraprostatic and pelvic disease FACBC with hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) has potential to improve selection of patients for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and IMRT/IGRT. Anatomical MRI at 1.5 Tesla (T) compared with transrectal ultrasound has demonstrated a higher sensitivity for tumor detection but almost the same specificity stressing the need for additional metabolic MRI. Advanced application of MRI such as proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (DCE-MRI) are increasingly being used for detection and characterization of PCa. The use of 3T scanners and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) consisting of anatomical MRI DWI 1H MRS and DCE-MRI demonstrated very promising result for staging and detection of PCa.    ,NCT02002455

Hydroxychloroquine may block this process from happening.    ,NCT02421575
Prostate Cancer,68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin PET/MRI in Imaging Patients With Prostate Cancer," This clinical trial studies the use of gallium-68 (68Ga)-DOTA-Bombesin positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in imaging patients with prostate cancer. PET uses a radioactive substance called 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin which attaches to tumor cells with specific receptors on their surfaces. The PET scanner takes pictures that capture where the radioactive drug is ""lighting up"" and attaching to tumor cells which may help doctors recognize differences between tumor and healthy prostate tissue. MRI uses radio waves and a magnet to make a picture of areas inside the body. Using 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin in diagnostic procedures such as PET/MRI may allow doctors to identify smaller tumors than standard imaging.    ",NCT02440308

Prostate Cancer,F-18 Sodium Fluoride in Prostate Cancer, Background: - Sodium fluoride (NaF) is a common compound that is found in various foods and can be used to increase bone strength. When this compound is added to a small dose of radiation (F-18) it collects in the bones with higher amounts in areas where the bone is rapidly changing such as the site of a healing fracture or a tumor. By giving F-18 NaF before a combined positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) scan researchers hope to be able to better measure the changes in the bone that may indicate that a certain type of cancer (such as prostate cancer) has spread to the bones. Objectives:   -  To evaluate the effectiveness of F-18 NaF in imaging studies to measure bone tumors and their change over time and compare with clinical course in individuals with prostate cancer.   -  To determine the smallest amount of change in the bone tumors that F-18 NaF can accurately measure. Eligibility: - Men at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have had imaging studies to determine whether the cancer has spread to their bones. Both patients with and without known bone involvement will be enrolled. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination medical history and imaging studies and will provide baseline blood samples to evaluate kidney function.   -  For the study participants will have two F-18 NaF PET/CT scans on separate days for baseline. These repeat scans will be used to determine the amount of change that is due to the imaging process alone (i.e. not due to the disease getting better or worse. Participants will receive a dose of F-18 NaF intravenously and will have PET/CT scanning over the body (mid ear to upper thighs) over 1 hour the body followed by a complete whole-body PET/CT scan at approximately 2 hours after F-18 NaF injection. Participants will be watched closely for side effects from the F-18 NaF until the scans are done and will be asked to drink plenty of water to void the F-18 NaF from the body after the scans.   -  As a followup study participants will have two more F-18 NaF PET/CT scans one 4 to 8 months after the first scans and then one 10 to 14 months after the first scans. Participants will provide additional blood samples before the followup scans.    ,NCT01240551

Prostate Cancer,Effect of TachoSilÂ® on Incidence of Symptomatic and Radiographic Lymphoceles After Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate and Bladder Cancer., Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is the most accurate staging tool to determine lymph node involvement in prostate and bladder cancer. The main complication of PLND is development of a lymphocele which can cause symptoms including lower abdominal pain leg or penile/scrotal edema bladder outlet obstruction deep venous thrombosis or infection/sepsis. The incidence of radiographic (asymptomatic) and symptomatic lymphoceles following PLND varies between 126-63% and 16-33% respectively. Medicated sponges such as TachosilÂ® are indicated in surgery for improvement of haemostasis and to promote tissue sealing. They could reduce lymphocele development by increased tissue sealing due to a mechanical effect of the sponge itself and a lymphostatic effect of the included thrombin and fibrinogen. Our goal is to prospectively assess the lymphostatic effect of Tachosil(r) in patients undergoing transperitoneal PLND with or without radical prostatectomy or PLND with bladder cancer surgery.    ,NCT02001857

Prostate Cancer,Comparison Study of Two Different Surgical Clips During Laparoscopic Urologic Surgery, Intracorporeal suturing and knot tying during robotic prostatectomy and laparoscopic and robotic renal surgery have historically been considered the most technically challenging and time consuming aspects of these procedures. With improved operative technique as well as the use of innovative surgical devices vascular control during these surgeries is often less cumbersome as compared with traditional techniques. Current standard methods of hemostasis include the use of clips of which the most popular design is the Hemolock a locking nonabsorbable plastic clip or the use of the very expensive endomechanical stapler. Unfortunately while they are associated with time savings in the operating room there is a great deal of disposable costs associated with these various devices as well as a not insignificant device malfunction rate reported in the literature. The aim of this case-controlled study is to evaluate the Aesculap U-clip device compared to our current technique of vascular control using the Teleflex Hemolock clip device during minimally invasive genitourinary surgery.    ,NCT01008709

Prostate Cancer,Open Anterograde Radical Prostatectomy Compared to Open Retrograde Technique, Prospective randomized study performing open anterograde anatomical radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP2A) using the same technique of minimally invasive surgery described by the Pasadena consensus for the procedure assisted by robot compared with the anatomical radical prostatectomy technique described by Patrick Walsh (RRP). Recent studies have shown benefits in the minimally invasive surgical techniques approaches laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and more recently robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). These minimally invasive techniques were associated with advantages in complications like intraoperative bleeding transfusion rates and in earlier recovery of important genitourinary functions such as urinary continence and penile erection. But still has not been demonstrated conclusively advantages as oncological control and it is believed that there are about 200 to 250 cases of learning curve so that the rates of complications and positive surgical margins become stable and similar to the open radical prostatectomy. These facts associated with the high cost of robotic technology still have limited the generalization of this approach in many developing countries such as Brazil. While the majority of studies made by comparing the radical prostatectomy (RP) robot X laparoscopic X open show a slight advantage in the first two there is a significant bias in these studies which is that the surgical technique used in each procedure differs significantly from minimally invasive and open surgical techniques. The evolution of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy was based on an entirely different anatomical benchmark of that described by Patrick Walsh. While robotics and laparoscopic techniques dissect the prostate bladder neck and the neurovascular bundle in an antegrade way from bladder neck to the apex the Walsh RRP technique is completely different in several ways the dissection is made from prostatic apex to the bladder neck so the retrograde direction the posterior layer of Denonvilliers' fascia is always included with the specimen and urethrovesical anastomosis usually performed with multifilament interrupted suture only for indicating the major differences. The RRP2A will be performed by incision (open surgery) and will be compared with the anatomical radical prostatectomy technique described by Patrick Walsh RRP and performed by the same surgeons.    ,NCT02687308

Prostate Cancer,Imaging of High Grade Prostate Cancer, Management of prostatic carcinoma varies according to stage of disease. Trans-rectal ultrasound guided biopsy is known to underestimate the degree of tumor due to undersampling and random non-targeted technique. Methods to improve pre-operative tumor localization and grading including multi-parametric (MP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an active area of research but requires further validation. High grade tumors can undergo comedo-type necrosis with malignant calcifications which only occurs in Gleason pattern 5 tumors and which we hypothesize can be reliably detected using computed tomography (CT) and/or MRI. Detection of malignant calcification within tumor foci will improve the accuracy of localization and grading in prostatic carcinoma.    ,NCT02177526

Prostate Cancer,AMG 386 and Abiraterone for Advanced Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  Advanced prostate cancer is treated with surgery or drugs that lower the levels of androgens (male hormones) in the body. However some cancers become resistant to this treatment. These types of cancers are known as castration-resistant prostate cancers.   -  Interfering with the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors can slow prostate cancer growth. AMG 386 a new anticancer drug targets the blood vessels that feed tumors. It has been tested for different types of cancer but not for prostate cancer. Researchers want to see if AMG 386 can slow disease progression in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. AMG 386 will be given with abiraterone and prednisone two drugs that are also used to treat advanced prostate cancer. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of AMG 386 with abiraterone for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Eligibility: - Men at least 18 years of age with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam medical history and imaging studies. Blood and urine samples will also be collected.   -  Participants will be separated into two groups.   -  The first group will have AMG 386 once per week for a total of four doses during a 28-day cycle. They will also take abiraterone once a day and prednisone twice a day every day of the cycle.   -  The second group will not have AMG 386. They will take abiraterone once a day and prednisone twice a day every day of the 28-day cycle.   -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.   -  Participants will continue to take the study drugs as long as the disease does not progress and there are no severe side effects.    ,NCT01553188

Long-term vaccination may be needed to control tumors. Researchers gave a group of men a series of vaccine injections over 2 years. Now they want to give those same men the new version of the vaccine. They want to see if it produces different types of immune responses and also ensure that repeated vaccinations are safe. <TAB> Objectives: - To find out the long-term safety of repeated TARP peptide vaccinations. Eligibility: - Men who took part in NCI protocol 09-C-0139. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with blood tests scans physical exam medical history and an evaluation of how well they perform everyday activities.   -  Participants will have apheresis. Blood will be removed with a needle from one arm. A machine will separate the white blood cells. The blood minus the white cells will be returned through a needle in the other arm.   -  Participants will have 14 visits. At each visit they will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will discuss any side effects.   -  Participants will get vaccine injections at weeks 3 6 9 12 15 and 24. The vaccine will be made from the participants own cells.   -  Participants will get a Vaccine Report Card to complete after receiving vaccine.   -  The study lasts 96 weeks.    ,NCT02362464
Prostate Cancer,A Phase II Trial of Leuprolide + Flutamide + Suramin in Untreated Poor Prognosis Prostate Carcinoma, One current hypothesis as to what limits duration of initial hormone response is the rapid emergence of hormone resistant prostate carcinoma cells. Suramin has shown effectiveness as a treatment for hormonally refractory prostate carcinoma. Survival was less in patients with high rather than low circulating androgen levels. Thus suramin might slow the emergence of hormone refractory tumor cells while combined androgen ablation may maximize the effectiveness of suramin. In this trial we will pilot this concept.    ,NCT00001266

Prostate Cancer,Pd-103 Dose De-Escalation for Early Stage Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Randomized Trial, The purpose of this study is to determine the most appropriate radiation implant dose for palladium-103 monotherapy. Radiation dose is related to potential cure. From previously published studies it appears that the prescribed radiation dose can be reduced by 14-20% without any difference in potential cure (in this study the dose is being decreased 10%). Although most patients tolerate brachytherapy well complications to appear to be related to radiation exposure to normal structures (i.e. urethra rectum and proximal penis). By reducing the prescribed dose it is conceivable that fewer patients will experience side effects and complications.    ,NCT00247312
Prostate Cancer,Preop Conformal Radiotherapy - Prostate, Radical prostatectomy and radical radiation therapy remain the standard treatment approaches for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (T1 T2).Radical prostatectomy is most effective when the disease is organ confined at the time of surgery. However in many series up to 60% of patients have positive resection margins at the time of surgery and there is evidence to suggest that these patients may not be curable by surgery alone. A number of preoperative clinical variables including clinical stage serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and Gleason scorea re helpful in determining the probability of finding organ confined disease at the time of syrgery.    ,NCT00252447
Prostate Cancer,CT/MRI Co-registration Prostate Cancer, The target volume in prostate cancer radiotherapy typically consists of the entire prostate gland which is localized by contours drawn on axial computed tomography (CT) radiation planning images. Compared with CT magnetic resonance (MR) can provide better definition of the prostate gland with respect to the surrounding tissues and the use of multi-plannar reconstruction avoids the problem of partial volume averaging inherent in CT. CT has been shown to significantly overestimate the volume of the gland using the MR-defined prostate volume as the gold standard. Co-registration of MR and CT datasets matched on fixed bony landmarks has enabled radiation planning using a MR-defined clinical target volumes combined with CT-based electron density information necessary for radiation treatment planning. Rationale and Hypothesis: Co-registration may allow better delineation of tumour volumes in prostate cancer. This investigation is a fesibility study designed to evaluate and optimize imaging parameters and co-registration techniques for CT planning and MRI Simulator.    ,NCT00252460
Prostate Cancer,Exercise for Physical Health in Men With Prostate Cancer, The purpose of this study is to conduct a 12-month randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of strength and impact exercise training to flexibility/relaxation training on body composition (bone muscle and fat mass) physical function (strength gait power balance and self-report physical function and symptoms) in men currently treated with hormone therapy for prostate cancer.    ,NCT00660686

Prostate Cancer,Study of Radioimmunoguided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) for Prostate Cancer, The current study involves a novel and aggressive therapeutic approach for patients' prostate cancer. In addition the investigators propose to administer hormonal therapy to patients with an especially high risk: those with initial Gleason scores of > 6 PSA > 10 ng/ml T3/T4 primary tumors and those found to be node positive (N+). The use of hormonal therapy in these specific settings correlates with our current standard of care. IMRT is better able to spare and protect normal tissues from receiving radiation than 3-D conformal RT. The radiotherapy would be followed by continued hormonal therapy for a total of 6 months in those who have one of the following Gleason 7 and PSA 10-20 and as per the previous version of this trial 1 year similar to that delivered by the EORTC for higher risk patients (those with initial Gleason scores of > 8 PSA > 20 ng/ml or T3/T4 tumors). Those found to be N(+) would have the hormonal therapy continued indefinitely or until disease progression occurred in a manner analogous to the Messing et. al. series in prostatectomy patients. The goals are to develop and administer a program of treatment that includes the most recent developments in imaging integrating data from both the CT scan and the ProstaScint scan to optimize prostate cancer RT. The CT scan will be used for staging and to determine the exact location of the entire prostate which will receive a reasonable dose of RT. The ProstaScint will be used to assess the spread of disease to lymph nodes as well as to determine the exact location of the tumor within the prostate gland. This region will then be boosted to a tumorcidal dose. The investigators then plan to monitor the toxicity and outcome of this treatment. The investigators expect that this program of radioimmunoguided IMRT will likely result in similar or less toxicity and increased cure rates when compared to conventional radiotherapy and standard IMRT programs.    ,NCT00956228

Prostate Cancer,Prevention of Metabolic Syndrome and Increased Weight Using Metformin Concurrent to Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, In current clinical practice an acceptable standard treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer is radiation therapy in combination with hormone therapy (called Treatment B or Group B in this study). However despite our best treatments there is a risk that the prostate cancer may eventually return. As well the hormonal therapy that is given to treat the prostate cancer is known to cause some harmful effects with some patients using the hormones gaining weight developing diabetes having increased cholesterol levels having increased blood pressure and/or heart problems. This study is looking at whether Metformin a drug that is commonly used to treat diabetes can prevent patients from developing some of the harmful effects of the hormonal therapy. In treating diabetes Metformin is known to decrease patients' sugar levels and also prevents patients from gaining weight decreases their cholesterol levels decreases the number of heart problems and allows patients to live longer. As a result the researchers in this study are hopeful that Metformin will also be beneficial for men with prostate cancer on hormonal therapy by preventing them from developing these problems.    ,NCT01996696

Prostate Cancer,Does Bloody Urine Predict Urethrovesical Anastomosis Leakage After Radical Prostatectomy, Traditionally the watertightness of urethrovesical anastomosis after robotic radical prostatectomy is controlled by cystogram. However clinical observations and one previous study showed that patients with anastomotic leakage have red coloured urine. If the investigators can verify this finding the most of the cystograms can be avoided. In this study the investigators estimate urine colour after cystogram and take a picture from urine collecting pag. Later on the pictures are digitally analyzed and compared to cystogram finding.    ,NCT02526589

Prostate Cancer,Ketoconazole Plus Docetaxel to Treat Prostate Cancer, This study will determine the maximum dose of docetaxel that can be given safely in combination with ketoconazole for treating advanced prostate cancer. Docetaxel is approved for the treatment of several other types of cancers; ketoconazole is an approved antifungal medication that is also commonly used in high doses to treat prostate cancer. Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced prostate cancer that does not respond to hormone therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with blood tests to evaluate liver kidney and other organ function and with x-rays scans or other imaging tests to determine the extent of disease. Participants will take the following medications:   -  Docetaxel daily infused through a vein over 30 minutes in 4-week cycles-3 consecutive weeks of drug followed by one week of rest   -  Dexamethasone 12 hours and 1 hour before and 12 hours after docetaxel infusions to help prevent fluid retention caused by the docetaxel   -  Ketoconazole 3 times a day   -  Hydrocortisone twice a day to replace a loss of natural steroids caused by the ketoconazole Patients will be hospitalized 1 to 2 days each for the first and second doses of docetaxel to allow for frequent blood draws to measure blood levels of the drug. Ketoconazole will be started about 2 weeks after the first dose of docetaxel and the second dose of docetaxel will be given 2 days after that. In order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel the first few patients in the study will be given a low dose of the drug and subsequent patients will get increasingly higher doses until unacceptable side effects occur. Because prostate cancer cells may grow if exposed to testosterone patients may have to have their testosterone production suppressed either surgically (removal of the testicles) or medically with an injection of leuprolide or goserelin which are luteinizing hormone-release hormone agonists that reduce the amount of testosterone. Imaging studies such as x-rays bone scans or computed tomography (CT) scans will be done about every 3 months to examine how the tumor is responding to therapy. After six treatment cycles patients will have monthly chest x-rays to check for fluid around the lining of the lungs which may occur as a result of docetaxel therapy. Treatment is expected to continue for at least 3 to 6 months although this time could be shortened or extended depending on the tumor response to therapy or side effects of the drugs. Patients who do not experience bad side effects and whose tumor does not grow during the first 3 treatment cycles will continue treatment; those who experience unacceptable side effects will be taken off the study.    ,NCT00032825

Prostate Cancer,A Phase I Feasibility Study of an Intraprostatic PSA-Based Vaccine in Men With Prostate Cancer With Local Failure Following Radiotherapy or Cryotherapy or Clinical Progression on Androgen Deprivation Therapy in the Absence of Local Definitive Therapy, Background:   -  Pox viral vectors can induce a PSA-specific T-cell responses and clinical responses in patients with advanced prostate cancer.   -  Intratumoral vaccines of recombinant fowlpox vectors appear to be more potent in inducing antitumor effects than the s.c. route of administration especially when the recombinant rF-vector given intratumorally is preceded by a rV-recombinant given s.c. This may be due to:   -  Making the tumor cell an antigen presenting cell via upregulation of both antigen (signal 1) and costimulatory molecules (signal 2).   -  Making the tumor cell more susceptible to killing via upregulation of ICAM.   -  The increased expression of perforin in peptide-specific T cells that came into contact with the TRICOM-infected targets.   -  Potentially allowing the immune system to select for other tumor encoded antigens to generate a polyvalent immune response. Objectives:   -  1: Safety and feasibility of an intraprostatic vaccine strategy.   -  2: To assess the change in PSA-specific T-cell response as measured by ELISPOT assay.   -  2: To evaluate T-cell infiltration histologically in patients who have pre- and post-vaccine prostate biopsies. Eligibility:   -  Must have either a) biopsy proven locally recurrent prostate cancer following local radiation as defined by the ASTRO consensus criteria as 3 consecutively rising PSA levels or b) have refused or not be candidates for local definitive therapy (surgery or radiation therapy) and have clinically progressive disease on androgen deprivation therapy (eg. three increases in PSA over nadir separated by at least one week). For patients with previous RT the biopsy confirming local recurrence must be done at least 18 months after the completion of RT.   -  Since this may also generate a systemic immune response patients with minimal extraprostatic disease may be enrolled.   -  Hepatic function: Bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dl AST and ALT< 2.5 times upper limit of normal Design:   -  Dose escalation Phase I design. Each cohort will consist of 3-6 patients with cohorts 4 & 5 restricted to include only HLA-A2 + patients; maximum accrual is 30   -  Patients in all cohorts receive initial priming with rV- PSA(L155)/TRICOM and rF-GM-CSF s.c.   -  The first two cohorts utilize a booster intraprostatic with dose escalation of rF-PSA(L155)/TRICOM.   -  Third and fourth cohorts add dose escalations of rF-GM-CSF along with the highest dose of rF-PSA(L155)/TRICOM   -  Last (5th) cohort u...    ,NCT00096551
Prostate Cancer,Gene Therapy for Prostate Cancer That Returns After Radiation Therapy, The purpose of this research study is to test a new treatment for prostate cancer. We have been exploring the use of cytokine (immune stimulating) gene therapy by directly injecting a virus which produces a cytokine called interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the prostate gland to control tumor growth. We propose to explore the use of adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12 (Ad.hIL-12) in patients with recurrent non-metastatic prostate cancer following radiation therapy in a Phase I trial. Participants will be placed in rising dose groups with the primary endpoint of learning the maximum dose that can safely be given by injection directly into the prostate gland. Toxicity will be determined through physical examination laboratory values and blood levels of cytokines. Evidence of an immune response against prostate proteins will also be monitored. If the treatment works the cancer will shrink or not grow. This will be monitored by prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in the blood. However we do not know if this treatment will be effective. If the PSA continues to rise after treatment participants will be taken off study and offered other treatment. There is no compensation for participation in this research study. There will be no charge for the treatment with gene therapy or the monitoring associated with this research study. Monitoring will occur in a specially designated clinical research center.    ,NCT00110526
Prostate Cancer,Vaccine and Antibody Treatment of Prostate Cancer," This study will evaluate the side effects of a fixed dose of vaccine and GM-CSF with increasing doses of anti-CTLA-4 antibody in patients with advanced prostate cancer. The vaccine consists of a ""priming vaccine"" called PROSTVAC/TRICOM made from vaccinia virus and a ""boosting vaccine"" called PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM made from fowlpox virus. GM-CSF is a chemical that boosts the immune system and anti-CTLA-4 antibody is a protein that may improve anti-tumor activity and the response to the vaccines. DNA is inserted into the priming and boosting vaccine viruses to cause production of proteins that enhance immune activity and also to produce prostate specific antigen (PSA)-a protein that is normally produced by the patient's tumor cells. Patients 18 years of age and older with androgen-insensitive prostate cancer that has spread beyond the original site may be eligible for this 7-month study. Candidates must have disease that has worsened despite treatments with hormones and up to one chemotherapy regimen. Their tumor must produce PSA and they must have no history of allergy to eggs or egg products Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination blood and urine tests electrocardiogram pathological confirmation of the diagnosis and presence of the PSA marker chest x-rays imaging studies to assess the extent of tumor and if clinically indicated a cardiologic evaluation. Participants receive the priming vaccination on study day 1. After 2 weeks and then again every 4 weeks while on the study they receive a boosting vaccine. All vaccines are injected under the skin. On the day of each vaccination and daily for the next 3 days patients receive an injection of GM-CSF to increase the number of immune cells at the vaccination site. On the day of the first six boosting vaccinations they receive anti-CTLA-4 antibody as an infusion through a vein over 90 minutes. Patients are monitored for safety and treatment response with the following tests and procedures:   -  Blood and urine tests monthly or more often if needed to monitor liver kidney and other organ function.   -  Imaging studies to assess the tumor before starting treatment again around study days 99 and 183 and then every 3 months after that while on study.   -  Apheresis (a procedure for collecting immune cells called lymphocytes) to measure the immune response to treatment. Apheresis is done three times: before starting the study and again around study days 99 and 183. For this procedure blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components by spinning and the lymphocytes are extracted. The rest of the blood is returned to the patient through the same needle. This will only be done in participants who have the tissue marker HLA-A2 (about 50% of patients). Patients whose disease responds to treatment and who do not develop severe side effects may continue treatment beyond the initial 7-month study period on vaccine alone (without the antibody). After treatment is completed patients are monitored for up to 15 years. This includes a medical history and physical examination for 5 years following the last vaccination. Information beyond 5 years is collected once a year by telephone.    ",NCT00113984

In men with negative biopsies the prostate tissue oxygen measurements will be compared with the peri-prostatic tissue oxygen measurements.    ,NCT00152789
Prostate Cancer,Mobicox: Study of Meloxicam to Reduce Prostate Swelling in Permanent Seed Prostate Brachytherapy, Swelling of the prostate can occur during and after a brachytherapy. This swelling can cause urinary problems ranging from difficulty voiding to urinary retention. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Mobicox started one week before brachytherapy and then continued afterwards is more effective in reducing the risk of needing a catheter than Mobicox given only afterwards.    ,NCT00152919
Prostate Cancer,Endorectal Coil Magnetic Resonance Images (ERC-MRI), When we acquired MR images of the prostate gland using a coil (receiver antenna) inside the rectum we can see areas with tumour in the prostate gland and well as details of the anatomy. The coil inside the rectum changes the shape of the prostate gland. In order to use this images to help target radiation therapy to the tumour better we need to deform the images to the original shape of the prostate gland without the coil. In this study we will develop a way to deform the images accurately.    ,NCT00160953
Prostate Cancer,Transrectal Tumour Oxygen - US Army, Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed tumor among men in the United States. Most patients have tumors that are confined to the prostate gland at diagnosis and are suitable for treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) that is aimed at curing the disease. Nevertheless despite recent improvements in these treatments a large number of men continue to die of prostate cancer. These patients often have spread of tumor to other areas of the body and are treated with hormones that produce initial tumor shrinkage. However over time the tumor learns to grow despite continued hormonal treatment. Effective therapy for patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer is lacking and patients often deteriorate quickly and die. Thus there is a need for better treatment that cures prostate cancer at an early stage and a better understanding of the biology of prostate cancer specifically with respect to factors that determine the effectiveness of RT the spread of tumor and the development of hormone-resistant disease. Low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) are known to exist in many human tumors and studies have shown that hypoxic tumors are less likely to be cured by RT. In addition hypoxia may lead to lower cure rates following surgery spread of cancer to other areas of the body and changes in the genetic characteristics of the cancer cells that cause them to behave more aggressively. The importance of hypoxia in prostate cancer has not previously been evaluated. The aims of this study are to determine how often hypoxia occurs in early prostate cancer and whether hypoxia influences the success of RT tumor spread beyond the prostate to bones and other organs and the development of hormone-resistant disease. Patients will have tumor oxygen levels measured using a special fine-needle electrode system prior to beginning treatment with either RT or the combination of hormones plus RT. The measurements will be made through the rectum using ultrasound to position and guide the electrode. A biopsy of the tumor will be obtained at the site of the measurements and this will be used to determine how oxygen influences changes in the genetic character of prostate cancer cells. A total of 195 patients will be evaluated in this way over 3 years. This study will provide unique information about the behavior of prostate cancer which may help explain why currently available treatments including surgery RT and hormones fail to cure patients. Assuming that this study shows hypoxia to be important in prostate cancer future work will focus on new anti-hypoxia treatments to be used in combination with surgery or RT with the aim of overcoming this obstacle and improving cure rates.    ,NCT00160979
Prostate Cancer,Exisulind Versus Placebo After Surgical Removal of the Prostate, This is a study in which patients with prostate cancer treated by surgical removal of the prostate and considered to be at risk for prostate cancer recurrence will receive Exisulind 250 mg twice a day or placebo twice a day for two years.    ,NCT00166426
Prostate Cancer,Exisulind Prior to Radical Prostatectomy, This trial will compare no treatment to exisulind therapy. Patients enrolled on the treatment arm will begin treatment 4 weeks prior to the scheduled date of surgical removal of the prostate and will take 375 mg by mouth daily for the 4 weeks prior to radical prostatectomy. Participants will be followed for total of 2 months from the time of starting study drug.    ,NCT00166478
Prostate Cancer,Evaluating the Effect of the VCD on Erectile Function and Penile Length Post RRP, The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized prospective study to evaluate whether the vacuum erection device facilitates an earlier return of erectile function post radical prostatectomy. A secondary measure will be to evaluate if the vacuum erection device can help prevent penile shortening.    ,NCT00177125
Prostate Cancer,Prevention of Osteoporosis in Men With Prostate Cancer on Androgen Deprivation Therapy (POP Study), The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the effectiveness and safety of once weekly alendronate (Fosamax) in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy and to evaluate maintenance of bone mass following termination of therapy after one year.    ,NCT00177619
Prostate Cancer,Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Evaluate Prostate Cancer, This study will determine whether scanning the prostate using special magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can detect prostate cancers with greater accuracy than other methods. MRI uses a strong magnet and radio waves to produce images of body tissues. Unlike many cancers prostate cancer is difficult to see on most imaging studies like x-rays computed tomography (CT) scans and conventional MRI scans. This study will use a magnet twice as strong as the magnets commonly used in MRI tests. Patients 18 years of age and older with prostate cancer confirmed by prostate biopsy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination and review of pathology reports. Participants undergo MRI of the prostate and possibly a biopsy of the prostate gland as follows: Prostate MRI Before coming to the NIH Clinical Center for the biopsy patients take a Fleets enema to empty the rectum of fecal matter. For the MRI an endorectal coil (a tube containing a specially designed antenna) is placed in the rectum which is just behind the prostate. The coil increases the amount of signal received by the MRI unit. Additional coils may be wrapped around the pelvis to further improve the quality of the scan. The patient lies on a stretcher that moves into the scanner. A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in an arm vein for injection of a contrast agent called gadolinium which brightens the images. Patients may also be asked to breathe an oxygen-rich gas through a mask during the scan to test the use of oxygen as a contrast agent in MRI. Patients may be asked to repeat the MRI to test the reproducibility of the procedure. The repeat test is optional. Prostate Biopsy Depending on the MRI findings patients may be asked to undergo a prostate biopsy to obtain a sample of tumor tissue. The tissue is obtained with a needle placed through the rectum. Medicines may be used to reduce pain during the biopsy and to reduce the chance of infection.    ,NCT00182624
Prostate Cancer,MR-Lymphography and Lymph Node Staging in Prostate Cancer, This proposal is targeted at all patients with prostate cancer who are candidates for either curative surgery or curative radiotherapy in whom lymph node staging is indicated. Recently it has been shown that in patients with PSA <10 ng/ml and Gleason score < 7 the risk of lymph node metastases is low. Therefore unnecessary PLND and non-invasive imaging can be avoided safely in this group. PLND is nowadays performed only in patients with intermediate or high risk for nodal metastases. Thus the subgroup of patients targeted in this study consists of patients with prostate cancer with a PSA >10 ng/ml and Gleason score > 6.   -  If the high sensitivity (90%) and negative predictive value (96%) of MRL can be validated in the 8 participating centres in patients with a negative MRL invasive PLND may be avoided.   -  In patients with a positive MRL with enlarged nodes (larger than 8 mm) histological diagnosis may be obtained by imaged guided biopsy and thus also in these patients avoid PLND. A limitation of image guide biopsy however is the 30% false negative rate. [Barentsz Oyen Wolf]   -  In patients with positive small nodes (smaller than 8 mm) the urologist may focussed by the MRL findings of a positive node outside his ?œsurgical field-of-view??extend his dissection and thus improve his accuracy.   -  Based on the expected higher sensitivity of MRL this technique will completely replace CT-scanning.    ,NCT00185029
Prostate Cancer,Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy - Prostate Cancer, There are several different treatment schedules being used across the world for treatment of prostate cancer with radiation therapy. In order to determine the best radiation treatment for this disease a study is being performed by the doctors at the Princess Margaret Hospital. This study will try to measure the effectiveness and side effects of an increased dose of radiation to the prostate that is also given over a shorter number of weeks than is usually done. In order to try to reduce the possible side effects of the radiation therapy the treatment will be given using special techniques to shield as much of your normal body tissues as possible. This method of treatment is called conformal intensity modulated radiation therapy or IMRT.    ,NCT00188513
Prostate Cancer,Effect of Casodex on Tumour Hypoxia - Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancers in common with many other tumours are often hypoxic; that is they have low levels of oxygen. It is thought that tumour hypoxia may hasten the progression of cancers and make them more resistant to treatment. One previous study has suggested that hormone therapy such as Casodex may improve the prostate oxygen level. This study is designed to test that finding.    ,NCT00188708
Prostate Cancer,Cone Beam CT for Daily Image Guidance - Prostate Cancer, Conformal dose escalated radiation therapy (CRT) is standard treatment for patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. CRT requires accurate daily localization of the prostate prior to treatment to correct for prostate motion and set-up errors. Cone beam computed tomography (CT) can accurately localize fiducial markers within the prostate. Cone Beam CT also provides important information on daily position of organs within the pelvis. This study aims to assess the feasibility of cone beam CT for daily localization of the prostate as well as document changes in size and location of pelvic organs during an entire course of CRT.    ,NCT00188786
Prostate Cancer,Xray Volume Imaging (Cone Beam CT) - Prostate Cancer, Conformal dose escalated radiotherapy was adopted as the standard treatment technique at PMH for intermediate risk patients with localised disease in 1997. This technique provides a much smaller margin of error for treatment set-up and delivery than with conventional techniques. One way to ensure the accuracy of treatment delivery is to image the prostate position daily prior to therapy to allow for appropriate set-up corrections. To do so imaging markers are implanted into the prostate under guided ultrasound (a standard procedure at PMH). However there are disadvantages in using imaging markers which include added time to the treatment planning process and an invasive procedure with a potential for discomfort bleeding and infection. This study will investigate and compare X-ray volume imaging to the gold standard imaging markers.    ,NCT00188799
Prostate Cancer,Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Perfusion to Detect Disease in Prostate Carcinoma, This is a pilot study of 50 patients to establish whether there is a potential role for MRI perfusion in the detection of locally recurrent or persistent prostate carcinoma after previous treatment with radiotherapy. All subjects will be patients who have had localised prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and have already agreed to undergo a biopsy of the prostate to look at local control within the prostate as part of their management. The objective of the study is to establish whether there is a relationship between recurrent or persistent disease within the prostate and increased perfusion on MRI at these sites.    ,NCT00230386
Prostate Cancer,External Beam Radiation Therapy - Target Volume, Delivery of conformal radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy is limited by the inability to define the clinical target volume (CTV). This stems from a poor understanding of patterns of local recurrence and limitations of standard imaging techniques.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising modality for imaging the prostatic bed following radical prostatectomy. MRI provides more detailed postoperative anatomy to guide CTV delineation the ability to document local recurrence patterns and a method to assess intrafraction prostatic bed motion and deformity to define appropriate planning target volume margins. The aim of this pilot study is to develop a technique for external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) following radical prostatectomy based on MRI-delineation of the CTV. Twenty patients will be enrolled in this pilot development phase.    ,NCT00230438

Prostate Cancer,Erectile Dysfunction/Prostate/RT/Androgen, The optimal duration of hormonal therapy is yet to be determined in the treatment of locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate. The RTOG performed a trial of 4 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent hormones(consisting of Goserelin and Flutamide) compared to radiation alone and found that there was an improvement in local control and progression-free survival but no improvement in overall survival. The EORTC performed a similar trial but used Goserelin alone for a period of 3 years. This trial showed an improvement in local control disease-free survival and in contrast to the RTOG trial an improvement in overall survival. The rate of erectile dysfunction in men who receive a prolonged period of Gosereline (i.e. 2 yrs) is not known but suspected according to expert opinion to be significantly higher than a shorter course of hormonal ablation. Therefore the price of of a survival advantage in locally advanced prostate cancer maybe at a cost of increased rates of erectile dysfunction.    ,NCT00242138
Prostate Cancer,Prostate Localization During Radiotherapy Using a Ni-Ti Stent and Electronic Portal Imaging - Protocol II, A new method for localization of the prostate during external beam radiotherapy.

Prostate Cancer,Adjuvant Leuprolide With or Without Docetaxel in High Risk Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy, This is a prospective multicenter open-label randomized phase III study in participants at high risk of recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. The study will investigate   -  Treatment with docetaxel (TAXOTEREÂ®) every three weeks (q3w) plus leuprolide acetate (ELIGARDÂ®) versus leuprolide acetate alone (ELIGARDÂ®)   -  Immediate treatment following prostatectomy versus deferred treatment at the time of relapse Using a 2x2 factorial design participants will therefore be randomized to   -  Immediate adjuvant treatment with docetaxel plus leuprolide acetate (chemotherapy and hormonal therapy)   -  Immediate adjuvant treatment with leuprolide acetate alone (hormonal therapy)   -  Deferred treatment with docetaxel plus leuprolide acetate (chemotherapy and hormonal therapy)   -  Deferred treatment with leuprolide acetate alone (hormonal therapy) Primary Objective:   -  The primary objective of the study is to compare progression-free survival using a 2x2 factorial design Secondary Objectives:   -  To compare the 5-year overall cancer-specific and metastasis-free survival after systemic treatment between the groups   -  To compare the safety and tolerability between Docetaxel in combination with leuprolide acetate and leuprolide acetate alone.   -  To evaluate quality of life as measured by the FACT-P questionnaire. Originally 1696 participants were planned in the study (with 424 participants randomized to each arm). However only a total of 211 participants completed the randomization procedure as of 26 September 2007. Thus sanofi-aventis in accordance with the Steering Committee decided to stop the participant recruitment as of 26 September 2007. Participants who had already signed their Informed Consent (IC) before September 26 2007 were allowed to enter the randomization if they met eligibility criteria. The final revised number of planned participants to be randomly assigned to the 4 treatment arms was 250 and 228 participants were actually randomized. The final sample size did not allow all the statistical analyses to be conducted on efficacy data. Therefore the protocol was amended to reflect the change in the plans for statistical analysis. The study was underpowered to serve as the basis for drawing conclusions regarding efficacy and quality of life (QoL) endpoints.    ,NCT00283062

Prostate Cancer,Collection of Blood From Patients With Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  It is not fully understood why prostate cancer in some men becomes androgen-independent (no longer responds to anti-androgen medication) but genetics likely plays an important role.   -  Genes contain the hereditary information that is passed down from parents to children. Although everyone has the same set of genes individuals can have different forms of the same gene.   -  Differences in genes may explain at least in part why some people develop a more aggressive form of prostate cancer than others. Objectives: -To obtain blood samples from patients with prostate cancer to try to identify gene differences associated with progression to the androgen independent state. Eligibility: -All patients participating in NCI prostate cancer protocols. Design:   -  Patients with prostate cancer are evaluated in the NCI s Medical Oncology Clinic.   -  Blood samples are collected at the initial visit or at follow-up visits.   -  DNA (genetic material) and white blood cells are extracted from these samples to be used for genotyping and establishment of cell lines.   -  Gene variations are correlated with prostate cancer prognosis and prognostic indicators.    ,NCT00923221

Prostate Cancer,A Pilot Study of Vaccination With Epitope-Enhanced TARP Peptide and TARP Peptide-Pulsed Dendritic Cells in the Treatment of Stage D0 Prostate Cancer, Background:   -  PSA (prostate specific antigen) is a protein found on normal and cancerous prostate cells. Levels of this protein are used to identify men who are at risk for prostate cancer and to monitor responses to treatment in men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer.   -  Research has shown that men who continue to have an elevated PSA level following primary treatment for prostate cancer are at increased risk for cancer progression. Studies have shown that the change in PSA levels over time or PSA doubling time (PSADT) can be accurate in predicting how quickly the cancer is likely to progress. Individuals with a PSADT of less than 3 months are at extremely high risk for disease progression and death from prostate cancer. Individuals with a PSADT of greater than 15 months have a very low risk of death from prostate cancer.   -  TARP is a protein that is found in about 95% of prostate cancers and is known to stimulate the immune system. The TARP prostate cancer vaccine is made from pieces of the TARP protein called peptides and includes peptides that have been modified to make them more effective at stimulating immunity. Although these TARP peptides have been shown to stimulate the immune systems of mice information is needed to determine if they also stimulate the immune system in humans. Since it is unclear what is the best way to give peptide vaccines the TARP peptides will be given with substances known to stimulate the immune system or in a vaccine made with the patient s own cells. Objectives:   -  To determine the immune system s response to vaccination with TARP peptides.   -  To determine the safety and toxicity of TARP peptide vaccination.   -  To determine if vaccination with the TARP prostate cancer vaccine can slow down PSADT in men with an intermediate PSADT of 3 to 15 months. Eligibility:   -  Males 18 years of age and older who have completed their primary treatment for prostate cancer have stage D0 disease are HLA A*0201 positive and who have a PSADT greater than 3 and less than 15 months. Design:   -  Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms:   -  Arm A will receive the TARP vaccine with other substances that stimulate the immune system.   -  Arm B will receive the TARP vaccine that includes a patient s own white blood cells.   -  First week of study after screening for eligibility has been completed:   -  Day 1: Apheresis procedure to extract white blood cells to test the immune response to the vaccine.   -  Day 3: Flu vaccine to allow researchers to determine how well a patient s immune system is working.   -  Clinic visits in Weeks 3 6 9 12 and 15 for physical examination blood samples and administration of the TARP peptide vaccine.   -  Physical examination and blood samples only in Weeks 18 and 36.   -  Additional blood samples and apheresis procedures in Weeks 24 and 48.   -  A 6th dose of TARP peptide vaccine will be administer to those patients who have a response to vaccination at week 24.   -  No follow-up or long-term study is associated with this study.    ,NCT00972309

Prostate Cancer,Vitamin C as an Anti-cancer Drug, Can high dose intravenous Vitamin C prolong life for patients with metastatic prostate cancer? Prostate cancer is the most common cancer (excluding skin cancer) in men in Denmark and the Unites States. When metastatic disease is present cure is no longer possible. The main treatment at this stage is castration either surgical or medical ending the patients testosterone production and causing a temporary regression in disease activity. Eventually the cancer will progress usually within 2 years from the castration with a more aggressive course and a survival of 2-3 years. The current treatment option for the patients who have undergone castration and have disease progression is chemotherapy with only limited gains in quality of life and survival. This clinical study is a phase 2 study to evaluate the effects of high dose intravenous vitamin c in subjects with early castration resistant prostate cancer. Primary endpoint:   -  Prostate specific antigen (PSA) changes after 12 to 20 weekly vitamin c infusions Secondary endpoints:   -  Bone metastases changes after 12 to 20 weekly vitamin c infusions   -  Changes in bone specific alkaline phosphates oxidative DNA-damage PINP NTX after 12 to 20 weekly vitamin c infusions   -  RNA-expression changes in prostatic tumor tissue after 12 to 20 weekly vitamin c infusions   -  RNA-expression changes in lymphocytes after 12 to 20 weekly vitamin c infusions Tertiary endpoints:   -  Pharmacokinetics of vitamin c in the elderly cancer patients Methods and material:   -  80 subjects are included (efficacy evaluation when 20 subjects have been evaluated for extension arm)   -  Each subject receives a weekly infusion of 60 grams vitamin c (in the form of ascorbate) for 12 to 20 weeks    ,NCT01080352

Prostate Cancer,Evaluation of Modern MRI in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in a Danish Setup, Clinical staging of prostate cancer in Denmark is determined solely by digital rectal examination and sometimes by TRUS even though the investigators know these examinations are inaccurate and have limitations. Since the majority of men diagnosed with prostate cancer will die with their disease and not of their disease and the different treatment-options may imply greater side effects it is important to improve the diagnostic localization and staging of the tumour for optimal clinical management and therapy selection. The development of modern multiparametric-high-field-magnetic-imaging (mMRI) offers new possibilities and approaches in detection localization and staging of prostate cancer due to its high resolution and soft-tissue contrast. mMRI can provide information about the morphological metabolic and cellular changes and characterize tissue- and tumour- vascularity and correlate it with tumour aggressiveness. This helps to locate and stage a possible tumour and to guide targeted-biopsies towards disease-suspicious areas. Internationally published data support the rapidly growing use of multiparametric MRI as being the most sensitive and specific imaging tool for prostate cancer patients. While mMRI internationally is a well recognized and accepted method for detection localization and staging of prostate cancer the use of mMRI in the diagnosis of PCa in Denmark has never been applied. Therefore this project is carried out in order to evaluate the use of modern mMRI in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in a Danish setup.    ,NCT01640262

Prostate Cancer,Health Effects of Soccer Training in Men With Prostate Cancer Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy, Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is standard treatment for locally advanced or advanced Prostate Cancer (PC). The musculoskeletal toxicity associated with ADT is well established leading to a decrease in muscle mass increased fat percentage weight gain sexual dysfunction and increased risk of depression fatigue diabetes cardiovascular disease and reduced quality of life. Numerous studies have shown an association between physical activity physical capacity and quality of life in cancer patients and recent epidemiological research suggest that regular moderate-intensity physical activity may have a positive effect on survival in men with prostate cancer. Within exercise physiology there is new evidence pointing to recreational soccer as a unique form of intermittent exercise that effectively stimulates aerobic and anaerobic energy delivery systems leading to beneficial musculoskeletal metabolic and cardiovascular adaptations of importance for health. It is our overall hypothesis that 12 weeks of recreational soccer training 2-3 times per week will improve the health profile of PC patients receiving ADT treatment.    ,NCT01711892

Prostate Cancer,Metformin-Docetaxel Association in Metastatic Hormone-refractory Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in men representing 10 deaths about of 100 cancers (INVS 2009). Treatment for metastatic prostate cancer when becoming resistant to hormone-treatment is mostly resumed to a relatively ineffective chemotherapy (Docetaxel/TAXOTEREÂ®) (1). Recently numerous clinical and preclinical works showed that Metformin could represent an excellent candidate for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. This is a widely prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes with clinical advantage of exhibiting very rare serious side effects. On the other hand the use of this molecule in patients was associated with a decrease of tumors incidence in particular prostate cancer (2). Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies support its role as an anti-cancer drug in several cell lines (3). These experimental results are consistent with a clinical trial pilot study performed in colorectal cancer showing anti proliferative effect of Metformin (4). In the field of prostate F. Bost in J.F. Tanti's team (INSERM U895 Nice) demonstrated that Metformin inhibits cell viability of human prostate cancer cells via mTOR downregulation and decrease tumor growth in a xenograft model (5). Furthermore preclinical data performed by this team showed that Metformin increased significantly apoptosis induced by TAXOTEREÂ®. Therefore by targeting specifically cancer cell metabolism Metformin offers new promising therapeutic strategy. The primary objective of this randomized study is to evaluate the biological efficacy of Metformin combination with TAXOTEREÂ® in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. To achieve this purpose PSA response rate will be evaluated according to ASTRO definitions (Bubley Carducci et al. 1999). Concurrently secondary endpoints will be under investigation in order to evaluate the clinical response according to RECIST criteria the overall and free-progression survival and the quality of life. Toxicity assessment will also be performed regarding to this drug combination. Considering the well tolerability of Metformin and the first clinical and pre-clinical data reports of it use in cancer treatment combining Docetaxel (TAXOTEREÂ®) with Metformin may represent a promising strategy for treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.    ,NCT01796028

In 2013 about 238590 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 29720 men will die of the cancer. Overall about 1 in 6 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime but only 1 in 36 men will die. Currently there are over 2.5 million men in the US living with prostate cancer. Standard treatment for prostate cancer has involved either removal of the prostate (radical prostatectomy) or application of some type of energy to the entire prostate gland in order to kill all of the cells--usually with radiation or cryotherapy (freezing). Over the past decade it has become apparent that while some men will benefit from treatment for prostate cancer many will not. Particularly for men with a small amount of low-grade (not very aggressive) type of prostate cancer the risk of death from this very slow-growing cancer is very low. However the risk of harm from some of the treatments for prostate cancer is very high. Treatment for prostate cancer can cause erectile dysfunction urinary leakage difficulty urinating and overactive bladder and bowel symptoms. One strategy for men with low risk prostate cancer has been to avoid immediate treatment and wait until the cancer starts to grow. The risk of this strategy is that some men may not be able to be cured once the cancer starts to grow. In addition men who are on this active surveillance protocol can become very nervous fearing that the cancer will start to spread. A new strategy to avoid some of the treatment harms of prostate cancer while also attempting to avoid allowing the cancer to grow is called focal therapy. Many men with low-risk prostate cancer will have only a small piece of cancer within the prostate gland. These men may benefit from treating only this one area instead of the entire prostate. This will allow the physician to kill the cancer cells and to avoid some of the problems associated with treating the entire prostate. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of focal targeted treatment of prostate cancer that is to treat only the small area of cancer instead of the entire prostate. We hope to show that this strategy will reduce the amount of side effects without compromising cancer cure.    ,NCT01802307

Prostate Cancer,Imaging Studies to Check the Local Response of Prostate Cancer to Radiation Therapy, Background: - Radiation is a common treatment for prostate cancer. It helps damage tumor cells and causes them to die. Radiation can be effective but some tumors may be harder to treat with radiation or even with surgery. This happens to a small number of men who have either radiation or surgery for prostate cancer. Most men who have these hard-to-treat tumors do not know if the tumor has recurred only in the prostate or has spread to another area. Also men whose prostate cancer has recurred only after radiation may have different treatment options. This study will use improved imaging studies to better understand why some men do not respond as well to initial radiation treatments. Objectives: - To use detailed imaging studies to look at the results of local radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Eligibility:   -  Men at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have radiation for prostate cancer.   -  Men at least 18 years of age whose prostate cancer has returned after earlier treatments. Design:   -  All participants will have a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be used to evaluate the cancer at the start of the study.   -  All participants will have an initial full magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate. Tumor and healthy tissue samples will be collected.   -  Those whose cancer has recurred after treatment will discuss possible treatment options with the study doctors.   -  Participants who are scheduled to have radiation will have radiation therapy. This will be given according to the current standard of treatment.   -  After radiation participants will have regular follow-up tests and imaging studies. They will have another full MRI scan 6 months after the end of radiation treatment.    ,NCT01834001

Prostate Cancer,Re-treatment Safety of Radium-223 Dichloride in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer With Bone Metastases, Eligible subjects must have completed 6 doses of treatment of radium-223 dichloride and experienced no radium-223 dichloride-related SAEs (serious adverse events) or CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 3 or 4 adverse event during or after the initial course of radium-223 dichloride that led to the discontinuation of treatment. 40 Subjects will be enrolled and will receive up to 6 doses of radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg IV every 4 weeks. The subject will be evaluated for AEs (adverse events) and laboratory tests at each visit every 4 weeks prior to receiving radium-223 dichloride. After the end of treatment visit the subjects will enter the active follow up period. Related AEs and SAEs and Lab tests will be evaluated at each visit every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years after the last dose of radium-223 dichloride. After the 2 years of active follow-up subjects will enter the long-term follow-up period and will be followed via telephone follow-up at 6-month intervals for late toxicities and survival up to 7 years after the last dose of radium-223 dichloride or until death. Joint safety reviews will regularly take place to oversee safety of the subjects conducted at regular intervals. An interim analysis of the safety data will be conducted during the study.    ,NCT01934790

Prostate Cancer,Outpatient Radical Prostatectomy - Surgical and Anesthetic Considerations, Radical prostatectomy has become the gold standard treatment for prostate cancer. Regarding of morbidity of access on open retropubic radical prostatectomy a lot of centers around the world start to develop laparoscopic and robotic approach over the past years. The problems regarding this techniques is that the pure laparoscopic prostatectomy shows a steep learning curve with a high initial complication rate and the use of robotic assistance surgery despite of lower learning curve is associated with higher surgical supply and operative room costs. These costs may have a significant impact on overall cost of prostate cancer care especially in Brazil. In Brazil the open route for radical prostatectomy is still the most frequent approach. One of the disadvantages of open prostatectomy from the other surgeries is the longest hospital stay. However the question of what length of stay after this operation is optimal and necessary is unresolved. In this trial the investigators have compared a randomized group of patients that had discharged on postoperative day 2 1 and same day surgery. The investigators had intent to evaluate the feasibility of ambulatory open radical prostatectomy (patient discharge in the same day of surgery - average 12 hours of hospitalization) maintaining patient satisfaction and safety.    ,NCT01955863
Prostate Cancer,Dose Escalation With SIB to Intraprostatic/Lymphatic GTV in High Risk Prostate Cancer, A single arm phase 2 study to study the outcome of dose-escalation with simultaneous integrated boost to intraprostatic lesion and positive lymph nodes. Prostate cancer patients with high risk of lymph node metastasis or oligo positive nodes in true pelvic area can be included. The boost volumes will be outlined by usin PET-CT and MRI data. Our hypothesis is that we will have fewer relapses in this very high risk patient group compared to matched historical controls with acceptable side effects.    ,NCT01962324
Prostate Cancer,Functional MR-guided Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy of Prostate Cancer, To improve radiation therapy of prostate cancer the investigators must be able to accurately identify the tumour. By using advanced functional imaging techniques available on state-of-the-art MRI scanners to clearly show the specific location of the tumour inside the prostate the investigators can use advanced radiation therapy techniques to specifically target the tumor and control it with as few radiotherapy clinic visits as possible. This is different than current techniques which treat the whole prostate gland to the same dose delivered over 7-8 weeks of daily radiotherapy visits. By increasing the radiation dose to the active tumor while still maintaining adequate radiation dose to the rest of the prostate the investigators hope to better control prostate cancer and reduce complications to nearby normal tissues.    ,NCT01976962

Prostate Cancer,A Study for Patients With Prostate Cancer to See Whether Delivering an Extra Dose of Radiation to Parts of the Body With More Cancer is Better Than Standard Treatment in Which the Same Dose of Radiation is Given Throughout the Prostate Gland, Patients with localized prostate cancer are routinely treated with radiation therapy to the entire prostate gland. The investigators can identify where the cancer is concentrated in the prostate gland using a newer specialized imaging technique called 11C Choline PET (stands for choline positron emission tomography). This is different from the older type of PET scan that has been used in the past (called FDG PET) which has not been as accurate as the new PET scan for identifying where the cancer is in the prostate gland. It has also been shown that delivering higher doses of radiation to prostate cancer cells in the prostate have resulted in better cure rates in patients with prostate cancer. Therefore for goal number one the investigators want to give higher radiation dose to the prostate cancer cells. But the challenge has been that delivering higher doses of radiation to the prostate gland may also increase the chance of complications from the higher doses of radiation to the rectum bladder and surrounding area. Therefore for goal number two the investigators want to minimize radiation dose to the rectum bladder and surrounding area. 3-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T MRI) is a new kink of scan that will be used in this study to identify the urethra in the prostate so that the investigators can minimize the radiation dose to the urethra. The investigators believe the 3T MRI scan is able to point to the areas of cancer that may be able to predict how well the treatments may work as well as which areas of the tumor appear to be responding to failing. In this study the investigators will keep the dose of radiation to the rectum and bladder as low as possible while increasing radiation dose to parts of the prostate with more cancer cells. The investigators will compare the cure rates in this study with the cure rates of other patients receiving the standard treatment in which the same dose of radiation is delivered throughout the prostate gland. The investigators will also compare the rates of complications in this study with the rates of complications in patients receiving the standard treatment in which the same dose of radiation is delivered throughout the prostate gland.    ,NCT02004418
Prostate Cancer,Standard Dose Versus High Dose and Versus Extended Standard Dose Radium-223 Dichloride in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Metastatic to the Bone, This study will assess different doses and regimens of radium-223 dichloride on the incidence of symptomatic skeletal events. Eligible subjects must have castration resistant prostate cancer with 2 or more skeletal metastases documented within 8 weeks of randomization. Subjects will be randomized to one of 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:1 fashion: a standard regimen of radium-223 dichloride of 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) injections every month for 6 months a high dose regimen of 80 kBq/kg (88 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update)injections every month for 6 months or an extended duration regimen of 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) injections every month for 12 months. Following the treatment phase subjects will be followed up every 12 weeks for a minimum of 2 years at which point they will enter a long term follow-up period during which they are seen every 6 months for up to 7 years after the last dose of radium dichloride. Symptomatic skeletal event and safety endpoints will be assessed at each clinic visit. Pain and analgesic use data will be collected every 4 weeks through Week 48. Additionally radiological assessments including MRI/CT of the abdomen and pelvis and chest CT as well as technetium-99 bone scans will be performed at Weeks 8 16 and 24 and continue every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression is documented in either the bone or in soft tissue. Radiological imaging will be evaluated by blinded central review.    ,NCT02023697
Prostate Cancer,A Randomized Phase IIa Efficacy and Safety Study of Radium-223 Dichloride With Abiraterone Acetate or Enzalutamide in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), The primary objective in this study is to evaluate bone scan response at Week 24 based on the quantified technetium-99 bone scan lesion area (BSLA). The safety of radium-223 dichloride in combination with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide will be investigated. The study will evaluate radiological progression free survival overall survival and skeletal events. This study will also explore the clinical utility of different imaging modalities (whole body quantified technetium-99 bone scan DW-MRI and NaF PET-CT scan) and will have a separate central radiological review for applicable secondary and exploratory imaging endpoints. All subjects will be randomized as assigned randomly by the IXRS system in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of the treatment arms: radium-223 dichloride alone 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) every 4 weeks for up to 6 doses; radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) every 4 weeks up to 6 doses together with abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg bid; radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) every 4 weeks up to 6 doses together with enzalutamide 160 mg daily.The study will consist of screening treatment and follow-up periods. Study will continue until disease progression as determined by investigator or when patient meets criteria for withdrawal from study. Subjects in treatment arms with abiraterone/prednisone or enzalutamide will have the option to continue taking oral study therapy until the end of the study (2 years from the last dose of radium-223 dichloride) if the investigator deems the subject may benefit and there is no clinical or radiological progression. Subjects who discontinue all study treatment prior to 2 years from last radium-223 dichloride treatment will enter active follow-up. During the active follow-up period the subject will have a safety visit at the clinic every 12 weeks from the EOT for up to 2 years from the last dose of radium-223 dichloride. Beyond 2 years from last radium-223 dichloride treatmentsubjects will enter long-term follow-up and will be followed via phone contact at intervals to assess for safety (hematological toxicity and new primary malignancies) and overall survival. A separate long-term safety follow-up study protocol is planned. Once implemented the study subjects surviving after the end of the active follow-up will be transitioned to this separate long-term safety follow-up protocol.    ,NCT02034552
Prostate Cancer,Improving Adherence to Oral Cancer Agents and Self Care of Symptoms Using an IVR, Improving Adherence to Oral Cancer Agents and Self Care of Symptoms Using an IVR The goals of this study are to improve adherence to oral chemotherapeutic medications and self-management of symptoms among cancer patients. More than 40 oral agents currently are on the market with projections that in three years 30% of the cancer treatment agents will be delivered in oral form. As a result patients must assume responsibility for taking medications and self-management of associated side effects. This longitudinal randomized trial tests and compares 'two strategies' for improving patient adherence to their oral cancer medication prescriptions to standard care. Both strategies incorporate symptom management support using an interactive voice response system (IVR) for symptom assessment and a printed evidence-based Medication Management and Symptom Management Toolkit (Toolkit) with helpful strategies and information for symptom management. We will collaborate with NCI Comprehensive Cancer Centers to recruit patients into this study. Recruiters will identify patients as they are prescribed oral cancer medications present the study to the patient and ask them to consent to be part of the study. Study Aims Following are the Aims of the study.   1. Cancer patients assigned to the intervention will have greater adherence to their prescribed regimen: a) at week 4 (immediate effect) and b) at weeks 8 and 12 (sustained effect).   2. When compared with patients receiving weekly assessments only patients receiving weekly assessments plus daily adherence reminders and printed symptom management strategies for 4 weeks will report: lower symptom severity during weeks 2-4 that will be sustained at weeks 5-8 and at 12 weeks. Two exploratory aims are assessed:   1. To test how patient characteristics (age sex depression) dose variation symptom severity and concurrent infusion therapy moderate the impact of the novel intervention on adherence at 4 8 and 12 weeks.   2. To test the impact of the novel intervention on dose alterations emergency department visits and hospital admissions over the 12 weeks in order to support the translation of this system into oncology practices.    ,NCT02043184

Prostate Cancer,Testing Decision Aids About Early Stage Prostate Cancer, This is an educational intervention study testing the effects of decision aids in promoting patient participation in early stage prostate cancer treatment decision making. The purpose of this study is to compare patient-physician communication between patients who receive a DVD that models patient communication strategies vs. those who do not receive a DVD. All patients will also receive a written decision aid that describes treatment options for early stage prostate cancer. The Investigators hypothesize that the DVD will:   -  increase patients' perceptions of the importance of their preferences to their decision making   -  increase patients' perceptions of their intention to discuss their values and preferences with their urologists and radiation oncologists   -  increase patients' actual engagement with their physician during the clinical encounter   -  increase the concordance between patient decision making preferences and actual decision making outcomes   -  increase long term satisfaction with decision on type of treatment selected   -  increase patient satisfaction with their decision and the decision making process   -  influence patient perception of his physician (e.g. trust) and of the diagnosis visit    ,NCT02053389

Prostate Cancer,Multi-Center Trial of High-resolution Transrectal Ultrasound Versus Standard Low-resolution Transrectal Ultrasound for the Identification of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer, This trial uses a ultra high-resolution ultrasound system and specialized transducer intended for use in prostate imaging. The system's image resolution is significantly better than the standard of care due to its higher frequency. This allows the system to visualize suspicious areas and structures and for greater accuracy for guided biopsy. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that ultra high-resolution transrectal ultrasound (UHR-TRUS) is superior to conventional low-resolution transrectal ultrasound (LR-TRUS) in detecting clinically significant cancer among men without known prostate cancer and with an indication for prostate biopsy. The secondary objective of this study is to compare the difference in the rate of detection of clinically significant cancer between LR-TRUS and UHR-TRUS from before investigator training to after investigator training. The tertiary objective for the investigation is to compare the combined sensitivity and specificity in determining cancer detection overall for image-guided biopsy in UHR-TRUS vs. LR-TRUS.    ,NCT02079025
Prostate Cancer,Surgery Versus Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer, This prospective open randomized phase III surgical trial seeks to study whether radical prostatectomy (with or without the combination of external radiation) improves prostate-cancer specific survival in comparison with primary radiation treatment and hormonal treatment among patients diagnosed with locally advanced (T3) prostate cancer. Untreated or conservatively treated locally advanced prostate cancer is associated with high mortality. Modern curative treatment for advanced solid malign tumors include surgery and/or radiation plus attempted chemotherapy if available to achieve both local control and elimination of potential micro metastases. Whereas there is evidence that surgery can cure localized prostate cancer there are no clinical trials of multi-modal treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer that includes surgical removal of the prostate. One potential advantage of adding prostatectomy to the treatment of LAPC is that removing the prostate enables a full pathological assessment of the tumor characteristics and thus a better estimation of the risk of recurrence. Surgical treatment could thus reduce the numbers needed to treat with chemotherapy and radiation and thus improve quality of life after treatment. In addition evidence indicate that residual cancer in the prostate occurs in 25% after radiation treatment (56)and surgical removal of the prostate may improve survival beyond what can be achieved by radiation and ADT. On the other hand patients treated with surgery radiation and hormones will experience side effects of all three treatment modalities and might fare better if radiotherapy plus hormones can provide oncological control without prior surgery. A randomized clinical trial comparing two multimodal treatment regimens of which one includes a radical prostatectomy is therefore warranted.    ,NCT02102477

Prostate Cancer,18F-DCFBC PET/CT in Prostate Cancer, Background: - Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. A chemical called a radiotracer helps doctors get images of this type of cancer. Researchers want to test a radiotracer called 18F-DCFBC. Objective: - To see if the radiotracer 18F-DCFBC can identify sites of prostate cancer in the body. Eligibility: - Men ages 18 and over with prostate cancer. The cancer must be newly diagnosed have relapsed or has spread outside the prostate. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with physical exam and medical history. They will give a blood sample.   -  Participants will be divided into three groups. Group 1: people with cancer only in the prostate scheduled for surgical prostate removal or biopsy at NIH. Group 2: people who had their prostate removed or had radiation therapy and now have a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) without other signs of disease. Group 3: people whose cancer has spread to other areas of the body.   -  Participants will have 18F-DCFBC injected into a vein then imaged in a PET/CT camera. During the scans they will lie on their back on the scanner table.   -  Group 1 will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A tube will be placed in the rectum. Coils may be wrapped around the outside of the pelvis. Participants will have a contrast agent injected through an intravenous line.   -  Group 3 will have another PET/CT scan with a different radiotracer 18F NaF within 21 days of the 18F-DCFBC scan to look for prostate cancer in the bone.   -  Group 3 will repeat the two PET/CT scans 4-6 months after the initial scans.   -  A few days after each scan participants will be contacted for follow-up.    ,NCT02190279

Prostate Cancer,MRI / Ultrasound Fusion With Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Guidance, Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. It is most often detected by an abnormal digital rectal exam or an elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen -determine by a blood test. When it is suspected that someone may have prostate cancer a biopsy is ordered. This biopsy is performed by the Radiologist with ultrasound guidance through the rectum. In some patients a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate may be ordered to further evaluate the prostate. In some situations the MRI and Ultrasound images will be fused (digitally merged) together during the ultrasound procedure to help localize the questionable lesions. Recent research has used an additional component known as a contrast agent - an intravenously injected inert substance - which is identifiable by ultrasound. This inert substance is more obvious in areas of increased blood flow which is a common finding in cancerous lesions. In this research project we would like to determine whether the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound is beneficial in improving accuracy of the biopsies taken and the relative correlation to the MRI/ Ultrasound-fused images.    ,NCT02233725

Prostate Cancer,Contrast Enhanced MRI of the Prostate, Prostate cancer detection and disease progression monitoring relies on systematic multi-core biopsies. Minimal invasive imaging capacities for lesion targeting and monitoring are badly needed. The purpose of this study is to determine if a new MRI technique can identify prostate lesions or to monitor prostate disease progression. If so biopsy core number can be reduced to as small as one and frequency for biopsy repeat can be reduced.

Prostate Cancer,Interest of Indocyanine Green in Neoplastic Prostatic Tissue, Prostate cancer with more than 70000 new cases and 8900 deaths a year in France is a major public health problem. Until 28% of patients treated with surgery will present a positive surgical margin resulting in an incomplete clearance of the tumoral process and exposing so the patient at a local systemic recurrence and increased morbidity. An increasing number of international publications have shown (ICG) was interesting for the detection of the sentinel lymph node in the surgery of tumors of type hepatocarcinoma and liver metastases from colorectal diseases but also in the surgery of the kidney bladder or breast. ICG has affinity for tumor and tissues around the tumor related to micro-vascular histology for a localized and specific deposit (EPR effect). The detection of ICG 's deposits is now possible with to the use of a device which allow to visualize the infra-red fluorescence (NIR; Near Infra-Red) for objects larger than 0.15 mm. Thanks to this feature the location of residual tumor tissue when performing a radical prostatectomy could be made much easier.    ,NCT02260349
Prostate Cancer,Single Fraction HDR Brachytherapy Plus Hypofractionated EBRT for Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Phase II Trial, The hypofractionated external radiation (EBRT) is a technique that radiation dose delivery using higher daily fractions than those used routinely. In this way can cause more damage tumor especially in tissues that have a slower proliferation rate as in the case of prostate cancer. Furthermore achieves a reduction in total treatment time and probably a lesser chance of development of collateral in tissues of high multiplication rate as the lining of the rectum and bladder effects. With brachytherapy boost for high dose rate is achieved by administering a more intense dose on the tumor and lower the sound around the region to be treated tissues improving the therapeutic window. Treatment with retracted and fully ambulatory time has potential benefit as early patient return to usual activities and optimizing the flow of patients who require treatment with radiotherapy. This prospective study aims to assess the results and the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen retracted.    ,NCT02283346

Prostate Cancer,SmartTarget THERAPY, The purpose of this study is to assess how accurately SmartTarget can direct high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to a pre-defined area (cancer) in the prostate. The current standard methods for treating prostate cancer are directed to the whole gland - either surgery to remove it or radiotherapy. An alternative method is focal therapy. This is surgery that uses an energy source to ablate the cancer whilst preserving the normal healthy tissue. Prior to surgery prostate cancer can often be localised using MRI imaging and detailed prostate biopsy techniques. The difficulty is that during surgery it is very difficult to accurately locate the cancer on the live ultrasound images - to compensate surgeons will treat half or a quarter of the prostate to ensure that the cancer is treated. This may cause higher rates of side-effects. SmartTarget is an MRI to ultrasound fusion device that maps the pre-treatment MRI onto the live ultrasound during surgery. It then provides a target for the surgeons to treat during the operation. The results will measure if the area intended to treat was covered and if how accurate the treatment was by comparing the pre-treatment MRI with a 1 week post treatment scan    ,NCT02290561

Prostate Cancer,SmartTarget: BIOPSY," The purpose of this study is to determine how well SmartTarget guided prostate biopsies perform compared with our current standard of ""visually directed biopsies"" in the detection of prostate cancer. The diagnosis of prostate cancer is dependent upon sampling the prostate to confirm disease. Standard trans-rectal biopsies are taken in a random fashion without prior knowledge of the disease location. Transperineal mapping biopsies overcome this by systematically samples the entire gland but are very intensive and time consuming to perform. An alternative method is to perform targeted prostate biopsies where an MRI prior to biopsy can be used to inform doctors about the location of the disease. This is a difficult procedure to perform as it requires the surgeon to mentally translate the location of disease on MRI image to the live ultrasound seen in theatre. SmartTarget may help this procedure by providing guidance to the location of the disease by fusing the MRI image onto the live ultrasound thereby providing the clinician a target to biopsy. This trial will compare the outcomes of ""visually directed biopsies"" with those directed by SmartTarget    ",NCT02341677
Prostate Cancer,Feasibility Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for Localized Prostate Cancer: Cyberknife vs. VMAT, Recent studies support the use of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for the treatment of localized prostate cancer (PrCa). SBRT is a way to deliver radiation very precisely allowing higher doses to be delivered with fewer treatments potentially improving patient outcomes. Cyberknife and Volume Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) are accepted SBRT techniques. However the effects of the specific SBRT treatment technique on patient outcomes have not been evaluated in randomized trials. Although such a trial would be of great interest patients' willingness to participate is unclear. Multiple patient and clinician factors contribute to the decision to enter a randomized trial. This feasibility study will evaluate patients' willingness to participate in a trial comparing Cyberknife and VMAT SBRT for the treatment of early stage PrCa. Patients accepting enrolment will be randomized to one of the two types of SBRT delivery. Up to 66 patients will be approached and up to 40 randomized. A questionnaire will help to identify the factors influencing the patient's decision to participate or not. This study will gather information on feasibility PSA control patient outcomes and side effects and will inform the design of a future randomized phase II/III study.    ,NCT02344667
Prostate Cancer,Multi-Epitope TARP Peptide Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Men With Stage D0 Prostate Cancer, Background: - Men who continue to have an elevated or rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) level after their primary prostate cancer treatment are at increased risk for their cancer to progress. The time it takes to progress is highly variable. One way to predict this progression is based on the change in PSA levels over time. This is called the PSA doubling time (PSADT). Researchers want to test a vaccine on men with Stage D0 prostate cancer. Stage D0 means the PSA has become detectable again or has started to rise after primary treatment but has not spread to other organs. Objectives: - To test a vaccine s effectiveness on the rate of PSA increase using PSADT and tumor growth rates. Eligibility: - Men with Stage D0 prostate cancer with a PSADT between 3 and 15 months. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with blood tests scans physical exam and medical history. Their prostate cancer will be confirmed.   -  Participants will undergo apheresis. Blood will be removed with a needle from one arm. A machine will separate the white blood cells. The blood minus the white cells will be returned through a needle in the other arm.   -  Participants will have 14 visits. At each visit they will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will discuss any side effects.   -  Participants will get injections of either the vaccine or placebo at weeks 3 6 9 12 15 and 24. Both will be made from the participants own cells.   -  Participants will be selected randomly to receive either active vaccine or placebo. For every two participants assigned to active vaccine one participant will be assigned to placebo vaccine.   -  Participants will get a Vaccine Report Card to to complete after receiving vaccine.   -  The study lasts 96 weeks.    ,NCT02362451

Prostate Cancer,Tumor Hypoxia With HX4 PET in Several Diseases, Regulation of tissue oxygen homeostasis is critical for cell function proliferation and survival. Evidence for this continues to accumulate along with our understanding of the complex oxygen-sensing pathways present within cells. Several pathophysiological disorders are associated with a loss in oxygen homeostasis including heart disease stroke and cancer. The microenvironment of tumors in particular is very oxygen heterogeneous with hypoxic areas which may explain our difficulty treating cancer effectively. Prostate carcinomas are known to be hypoxic. Increasing levels of hypoxia within prostatic tissue is related to increasing clinical stage patient age and a more aggressive prostate cancer. Several researches indicated that hypoxia might also play a role in esophageal cancer. In glial brain tumors hypoxia is correlated with more rapid tumor recurrence and the hypoxic burden in newly diagnosed glioblastomas is linked to the biological aggressiveness. In brain metastases CA-IX expression (a marker for hypoxia) is correlated to the primary non-small cell lung carcinomas. Hypoxia enhances proliferation angiogenesis metastasis chemoresistance and radioresistance of hepatocellular carcinoma. The hypoxic markers HIF-1Î± VEGF CA-IX and GLUT-1 were all over expressed in colorectal cancer and its liver metastases. Based on literature hypoxia in tumors originating or disseminated to prostate esophagus brain and rectum cancer will be studied in this trial.    ,NCT02584400

Prostate Cancer,Treatment With Sandostatin in Patients With Castrate Resistance Prostate Cancer Showing Uptake of 68Ga-DOTATET, Purpose: Castrate resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) often shows histological evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). Recently the investigators initiated a research project investigating the uptake of the radiotracer 68Ga-DOTATET (a marker of neuroendocrine tumors-NET) in PET/CT in patients with CRPC. In 4/8 patients studied thus far uptake of the tracer in bone metastases was found. It has been shown that monthly injections of Somatostatin lengthen overall survival in patients with NET. The purpose of the current project is to examine the ability of Somatostatin to stabilize or possibly reverse metastases in patients with CRPC that express high level of somatostatin receptors in 68Ga-DOTATET PET/CT. Materials and Methods: 30 patients with CRPC will be studied with 68Ga-DOTATET PET/CT. Patients showing uptake of the radiotracer 68Ga-DOTATET in at two least to metastases will be considered eligible for the study. These patients will be evaluated biochemically and clinically and will be treated with monthly injections of Sandoatatin LAR - 30mg. Clinical biochemical and imaging studies (68Ga-DOTATET PET/CT) will be repeated after 4 and 12 months of treatment. Responding patients (stabilization or decrease in the number and SUV of metastases) will be subjected to continued therapy until progression.    ,NCT02631616

Prostate Cancer,Hemi-Ablative Prostate Brachytherapy," This clinical study will evaluate side effects quality of life and cancer control in patients with prostate cancer diagnosed on only one side of the prostate gland. The diagnosis of unilateral prostate cancer will be made by means of a prostate transperineal template biopsy (TTB) and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Patients will be treated with low dose rate brachytherapy using permanent iodine seed implants.Treatment will be limited to the side of the gland where the cancer has been diagnosed and is therefore called ""focal"" brachytherapy. Prostate brachytherapy is usually applied to the whole prostate gland. After whole gland prostate brachytherapy urinary bowel and sexual function may be affected. In this focal approach the side effects will be evaluated by means of patient questionnaires.These will be repeated at various intervals after treatment.The results will be compared to the same questionnaires responded by patients who have undergone whole gland brachytherapy.Therefore an assessment can be made whether focal therapy produces fewer side effects than whole gland brachytherapy.The observation period will last for two years after treatment. A biopsy and mpMRI will be repeated after two years to evaluate prostate cancer control.    ",NCT02632669
Prostate Cancer,Multiparametric MRI for Prostate Cancer Localization and Characterization Using Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection, Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among men in the United States and Canada. Suspicion of prostate cancer with modern screening tests such as digital rectal exam (DRE) and prostate serum antigen (PSA) require ultrasound-guided biopsy for pathological diagnosis. However this technique misses cancer in nearly one quarter of patients and finds clinically insignificant disease in another third of patients resulting in over-treatment and unnecessary morbidity. MRI is the best imaging method for prostate cancer detection but current techniques cannot reliably predict tumour grade and are often unreliable for localizing cancer particularly within the transition zone where specificity is low. The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the added benefit of localizing prostate cancer and predicting tumour grade with Hyperpolarized 13C MRI in addition to traditional T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The investigators propose a pilot study in men diagnosed with prostate cancer awaiting prostatectomy with the specific goals of comparing pre-operative imaging findings to ground truth histology using whole-mount prostate specimens. The results of this study will provide insight into the prostate cancer disease signatures with MRI and determine if there is added benefit for incorporation of this new technique into future clinical MRI protocols. If future imaging tests could determine the size grade and extent of disease this would open the door for less invasive localized treatment options with reduced morbidity.    ,NCT02647983
Prostate Cancer,Hypofractionated Intensity Modulated and Image Guided Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer, Hypofractionated intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy (HypoIGRT) with fewer high-fraction-size treatments would be beneficial for prostate cancer because it would deliver a larger biological-equivalent dose to the tumor than would conventional treatment in 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions while maintaining a similar or lower incidence of late normal tissue reactions. Thus the investigators aim to assess the hypothesis that HypoIGRT treatment for localized prostate cancer will improve the therapeutic ratio by either:   1. Reducing normal tissue mainly genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity and / or   2. Improving tumour control mainly freedom from biochemical failure survival.    ,NCT02651896
Prostate Cancer,Engaging Newly Diagnosed Men About Cancer Treatment Options," This research is being done to better understand how a new lab test called the Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay may impact what treatment men decide to get and how they feel and think about their choice of treatment. The study will compare men who receive this new lab test with men who receive the usual counseling given to men after they get a new diagnosis of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is sometimes slow-growing and sometimes fast-growing. Healthcare providers are searching for better ways to predict how each tumor will behave so that each man can make a better decision about when to receive treatment. The Oncotype DX lab test uses leftover prostate biopsy tissue to generate a Genomic Prostate Score (GPS). The GPS is related to the risk of a fast-growing cancer being discovered if surgery is performed to remove a man's prostate. The goal of this study is to find out if this test helps men when they are deciding how their prostate cancer will be treated. Treatment options include surgery to remove the prostate radiation therapy or an approach called ""active surveillance"" in which there is no immediate therapy and the tumor is watched using prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests and repeat biopsies.

Prostate Cancer,PSMA PET/CT for Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer (PC) is the third most common cause of cancer death in men. Most patients with localized PC will be cured with surgery or radiation therapy but up to 35% of patients will have their PC return. Whether it has returned locally or distantly determines which type of treatment they will receive. Current conventional imaging modalities have limitations particularly at low PSA levels. This study proposes to use 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans which targets prostate-specific membrane antigens (PSMA) to detect where in the body the PC has recurred.    ,NCT02899312

Prostate Cancer,Oral Docetaxel (ModraDoc/r) in Combination With Hormonal Treatment and Radiation Therapy in High-risk Prostate Cancer, The optimal treatment for HRPC patients has not yet been established. Recent trials suggest a benefit from early treatment with docetaxel in the castration-sensitive setting with an improvement in failure free survival in high risk and metastatic patients and increase in overall survival in the metastatic hormone-sensitive group. In these recent randomized controlled trials patients were treated with hormonal therapy and radiotherapy and adjuvant docetaxel assuming that early systemic treatment for high risk or metastatic disease could delay progression in patients with aggressive primary tumor characteristics. With the fact that docetaxel is a known radiosensitizer combined modality treatment with docetaxel during the radiotherapy could also lead to better local control and reduction of local recurrence. Several phase I and II studies have been done in HRPC patients to evaluate the combination of high dose radiotherapy and concurrent weekly infusions with docetaxel. Oral administration of docetaxel has many advantages above intravenously administered drugs for patients. Besides the higher patient convenience possibly longer treatment duration can be achieved due to better safety. Frequently occurring toxicities of intravenously administered docetaxel such as neutropenia hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral polyneuropathy have rarely been observed with the oral docetaxel formulation ModraDoc006/r. The primary aim of the N15DOP study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of ModraDoc006/r when given in a weekly bidaily schedule in combined modality with high dose intensity radiotherapy and hormonal therapy in castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients with high risk disease including positive lymph nodes.    ,NCT03066154

Initially a tolerability and safety phase (phase Ib escalation) will be performed to confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended doses of both BI 836845 and enzalutamide that can be taken together. Once the MTD or recommended phase II dose have been determined an expansion cohort will also be explored (phase Ib expansion) in CRPC patients already taking enzalutamide and have a rise in prostate serum antigen (PSA) levels. Patients may not have received prior docetaxel or abiraterone. Patients in this cohort will receive the MTD or recommended phase II dose of BI 836845 and enzalutamide determined in the phase Ib escalation phase. The randomised trial (phase II) will be an open label parallel group study design in a 1:1 ratio to which patients will receive either BI 836845 plus enzalutamide (Arm A) at the MTD/recommended doses or enzalutamide alone (Arm B).

Prostate Cancer,FACBC for Recurrent Prostate Cancer, Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor with approximately 200000 new cases diagnosed per year. Several different local therapies are available for treatment; including surgery and radiotherapy Significant advances have been made which have improved the cancer control outcomes and treatment. Despite these significant advances approximately 30% of patients treated with definitive local therapy experience recurrent disease. Recurrent (returning) disease usually displays rising PSA (blood test for prostate cancer). The PSA level is often of limited use in differentiating local recurrence (i.e. recurrence in the prostate bed) from recurrence outside of the prostate bed (extra-prostatic recurrence). Imaging plays a central role in the detection of recurrent prostate carcinoma in the prostate bed and in the differentiation of prostatic from extraprostatic recurrence. There are newer methods of imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) with molecular radiotracers that are currently under study for the imaging of post-therapy recurrence. One PET radiotracer which has shown promise in the staging and restaging of patients with prostate carcinoma is anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (anti-3-[18F]FACBC) which is a synthetic amino acid analog. FACBC demonstrated higher accuracy compared with other methods in the restaging of patients with suspected recurrent prostate carcinoma. FACBC has been tested in over 140 subjects in other studies in the Emory system including 128 subjects with prostate cancer. The investigators will perform a study with 25 patients in whom the investigators have a strong suspicion of prostate cancer that has returned to the body after having an initial treatment. The major goal of the investigation is to see whether anti-[18F] FACBC PET-CT and MRI imaging individually then together will be useful in the detection of local and extraprostatic recurrence of prostate cancer. Routine blood test will be done on the day of the FACBC scan and one week later as required by the FDA. All patients will undergo biopsy of the prostate as clinically appropriate per standard of care. If either the FACBC or MRI scans indicate cancer recurrence the subject's cancer site(s) will also be biopsied as clinically appropriate. Biopsy of the suspected recurrence sites will be scheduled at the subjects' convenience as soon as possible after the scans. Tissue obtained from the biopsy will undergo standard analysis to determine if prostate carcinoma cells are present. The secondary goal will be to use left-over biopsy material to determine if there are genotypic differences between prostate carcinoma recurrence confined to the prostate bed and extraprostatic recurrence    ,NCT01808222

Prostate Cancer,Brachytherapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer, After a curative treatment by radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer between 20% and 50% of patients may have a biological relapse as a progressive re -rise of PSA. After prostate brachytherapy with low flow this rate is between 2% and 6%. Depending on risk factors initially present some patients will have a micro metastatic disease at the time of re-rise but others will have a true local recurrence purely intra-prostate. Local recurrence after radiotherapy is associated with a high incidence of distant metastatic relapse and poor overall survival. For these reasons the possibility of offering a local treatment for this selected population of patients can have a major therapeutic interest and allow changing a situation often considered palliative to the possibility of a second curative treatment. Currently there is no consensus regarding the optimal management of patients with purely local recurrence after prostate irradiation at first intention. When an external radiotherapy or brachytherapy is performed as first choice in a patient with prostate cancer several remedial treatments have been proposed with controversial results the decision-making for clinicians and for difficult patients. These main therapeutic options remedial (surgery cryotherapy and brachytherapy) have the potential for complications such as rectal injury impotence or incontinence Brachytherapy is a new salvage treatment being evaluated in the United States (Phase II study of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group No. 0526). Several retrospective trials have shown very encouraging results in terms of acute toxicity and biochemical control in the short term. Thus a team from Mount Sinai in New York recently published for the first time 10 years retrospective results with this approach. In their experience after treatment failures with external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy a dose of 122 Gy was delivered over 90% of the prostate gland. Doing this they observed biochemical control rates and survival specific of 54 % and 96 % respectively at 10 years with an hormone treatment associated (median 6 months) in 84 % of cases. Four patients had grade 3 toxicity or higher (11%). To reduce the rate of late toxicities the team from the University Of California San Francisco (UCSF) tested focal brachytherapy guided by functional MRI (MRI spectroscopy) to re-treat local recurrence after initial brachytherapy as monotherapy or boost. By delivering 144 Gy on recidivism objectified on MRI the authors observed that a minimal dose of 37Gy covered 90 % of the prostate gland to treat the risk of microscopic disease. Doing this the rate of observed toxicities and biochemical control appeared encouraging with a median follow-up of 2 years since no grade 3 toxicity was observed and 74% of patients achieved a PSA nadir <0.5 ng / mL without associated hormone. In case of external radiation or brachytherapy several attempts proposed to associate an injection of hyaluronic acid gel to the prostate - rectum interface to spare healthy tissue irradiated and thus reduce the rate of radiation proctitis. The feasibility of implementing this gel has been demonstrated in patients with non- irradiated tissues. No inherent toxicity of the injection of hyaluronic acid gel has been described after prostate brachytherapy first line. The feasibility of this injection remains unproven to date on patients previously irradiated externally or by brachytherapy. We hypothesize that the risk of radiation proctitis and fistulas front prostate could be reduced using this technique in this indication. We propose to carry out a French prospective multicenter phase II trial combining brachytherapy remedial with an injection of hyaluronic acid after surgery to reduce the risk of radiation proctitis and / or recto -urinary fistula in a patient population hyper- selected with a high probability of isolated local recurrence.    ,NCT01956058

Using 68Ga-PSMA for PET/CT or PET/MRI may allow doctors to identify smaller tumors than standard methods.    ,NCT02488070
Prostate Cancer,Hyperthermia and High Dose Rate Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radiation, This phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give hyperthermia and high dose rate radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that has come back after prior radiation treatment. Radiation therapy such as high dose rate brachytherapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Hyperthermia therapy may make tumor cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy by heating them to several degrees above normal body temperature. Giving hyperthermia and high dose rate radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with recurrent prostate cancer after radiation.    ,NCT02899221
Prostate Cancer,Prospective Evaluation of 68-Ga-prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-Positron Emission Tomograph (PET) and Early Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) Kinetics During Salvage Radiotherapy for Personalizing the Management of Men With Relapse of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy, This is an open-label phase II trial in patients with PSA recurrence after prostatectomy. Patients entering the study will all receive initial 50 Gray (Gy) radiotherapy (25 x 2Gy) to the prostate bed and thereafter be classified as either responders or non-responders depending on PSA response at fifth week of radiotherapy. A 68-Ga- PSMA-PET is done before start of radiotherapy and analyzed before fifth treatment week in order to identify cancer lesions in patients with poor PSA response. Patients with PSA response after 5 weeks of radiotherapy will not receive any subsequent therapy whilst patients with poor PSA response may be in need for additional therapy such as radiotherapy to lymph node metastases and/or boost fractions to local recurrence. Patients with more than 3 lymph node metastases or distant metastases will not receive any more radiotherapy but individualized systemic therapy will be started.    ,NCT02699424

Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays directly to the tumor using small high doses of radiation over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue. This treatment schedule allows for a higher dose of radiation to be administered over a shorter overall treatment period in comparison to standard radiation therapy.    ,NCT02470897
Prostate Cancer,PLX3397 Radiation Therapy and Antihormone Therapy in Treating Patients With Intermediate- or High-Risk Prostate Cancer, This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (PLX3397) when given together with radiation therapy and antihormone therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that is at intermediate or high risk of spreading. Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may also help the radiation therapy work better. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy such as leuprolide acetate goserelin acetate or degarelix may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Giving multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 with radiation therapy and antihormone therapy may be a better treatment for prostate cancer.    ,NCT02472275
Prostate Cancer,Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery, This phase I trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating patients with prostate cancer that is likely to come back or spread (high-risk) undergoing surgery.

Prostate Cancer,Endoscopic Evaluation of Late Rectal Injury Following CyberKnife Radiosurgery for Prostate Cancer, Radiation therapy is a well-established treatment modality for clinically localized prostate cancer. Men who choose to undergo radiation treatments for prostate cancer will have to live with the side effects for many years. Attempts have been made to protect surrounding tissues while delivering high dosage of radiation to cancer. With the rectum being so close to the prostate many patients still suffer from side effects caused by radiation injury to the rectum especially those who received conventional external beam radiotherapy. CyberKnife is an FDA approved radiosurgical devise. Its flexible robotic arm allows radiation beams to be delivered in different directions providing a highly conformal uniform dose with steep dose gradients. Therefore treatment with the CyberKnife radiosurgical system should minimize the toxicity to the surrounding structures. CyberKnife System also incorporates a dynamic tracking system to allow the robot to correct the targeting of therapeutic beams during treatment. These improvements allow for dose escalation within the prostate with less normal tissue toxicity. The purpose of this study is to estimate the proportion of patients with endoscopically detectable telangiectasia as the indication of radiation injury to the rectum after CyberKnife Treatment for prostate cancer.    ,NCT01618838
