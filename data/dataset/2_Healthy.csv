Healthy,Brain Effects of Escitalopram and Citalopram Using fMRI, Escitalopram (Lexapro) and citalopram (Celexa) are similar selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that alter blood flow to the amygdala and other brain structures involved in regulating mood. Escitalopram consists of S-citalopram while citalopram contains both S-citalopram and R-citalopram (racemic citalopram). There is evidence that R-citalopram may block the effects of S-citalopram. The hypothesis being tested is that because of the antagonist effect of R-citalopram S-citalopram will have a greater effect on the mood circuit than racemic citalopram when equal doses of S-citalopram are administered. The study design consists of a two week medication period followed by blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing affective visual stimuli.    ,NCT00825825

Healthy,Comparing Head and Neck Endoscopy Procedures, Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy planning is based on CT images with tumour volumes defined on this volumetric information data set. However target delineation also depends on disease seen endoscopically which may not be visible on CT. We are developing imaging and tracking technology to improve target delineation in Radiation Therapy (RT) planning for head & neck cancer using quantitative registration of 2D endoscopic information with CT data. Diagnostic endoscopy is performed in the upright position. CT images and radiation delivery are obtained with the patient in the supine position. The accuracy of the registration will be improved if performed in the same position to prevent mobile soft tissue structures shifting between the upright and supine positions. Since therapy must be performed in the supine position we intend to check the feasibility of performing endoscopy in the supine treatment position. We will compare and assess patient comfort and endoscopic sightlines during an endoscopy procedure in both the upright and supine positions.    ,NCT01181362
Healthy,Complement 2: Blood Donations to Develop Vaccines Against Infectious Diseases, We need human blood to understand the immune response to infection and to test promising new vaccines against infectious diseases in the laboratory. One test is called the Serum Bactericidal Assay (or SBA) which is measure of how effective antibodies are at killing certain bacteria and can be an important measure of how effective a new vaccine may be. The samples would be used in the laboratory analysis of clinical trials of vaccines used in adults and children and some samples in pre-clinical (animal) experiments testing new vaccines before they enter human-stage testing. Most people have some form of protection against most bacteria already so not everyone is a suitable blood donor for this laboratory test. We therefore start by taking a small blood sample and test this one before asking for more blood if we found yours suitable for the work we do.    ,NCT01945307

Normal volunteers participating in this study face a screen on which spots or patterns of light are projected. They are asked to respond to the patterns by voice eye movements or hand movements. Eye and lid movements are recorded in one of the following ways:   1. Electro-oculogram < small disc electrodes taped to the skin near each eye measure the eye movements as the eyes change position.   2. Infrared detector < an infrared beam is reflected off the eye and picked up by detectors that record the eye movements.   3. Contact lens ring < a smooth plastic ring is placed on the white of the eye surrounding the cornea and eye position is measured using a magnetic coil. Study sessions last less than four hours.    ,NCT00001172
Healthy,Studies of In Vitro B Lymphocyte Responses in Subjects Receiving Tetanus Toxoid Booster Immunization, One of the major interests of this laboratory is the characterization of the cellular subpopulations involved in the triggering and immunoregulation of B lymphocytes to produce antibodies. We are assessing the responses of individuals to produce antibodies against newly encountered antigens such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (approved project number 77-I-0130) and propose to assess the amnestic responses to the previously encountered antigen tetanus toxoid. The purpose of this protocol is to add this recall antigen to our repertoire of antigens used to evaluate the immune response in man. Booster immunization with tetanus/diphtheria toxoid has now been used for several years by a number of clinical immunology laboratories throughout the country to assess B cell related immunologic profiles in patients and control normal subjects. We have recently developed a sensitive ELISA assay for IgM and IgG in vitro specific antibody responses against tetanus toxoid. This will allow us to carefully and precisely monitor the evolution and immunoregulation of the human B cell responses to this recall antigen. This is of particular importance and relevance to us in our ongoing studies of a number of diseases characterized by abnormalities of immunologic reactivity including those treated with various regimens of immunosuppressive agents.    ,NCT00001173
Healthy,Evaluation of Patients With Unusual Diagnostic or Treatment Considerations, This study offers evaluation and treatment of patients with unusual diagnostic or treatment considerations. It is not designed to test new treatments; rather patients will receive current standard of care treatments. The purposes of the study are: 1) to allow NIDCR staff an opportunity to maintain and improve their clinical skills; and 2) to evaluate referred patients for research potential. (Participants in this protocol will not be required to join a research study; the decision will be voluntary.) Patients in need of dental/oral diagnosis and therapy of interest to NIDCR staff dentists may be eligible for this protocol. Participants will have a comprehensive dental examination and may receive part or all of their treatment at the NIDCR clinic. Diagnostic procedures materials and treatments used in this study are limited to those widely accepted in dentistry and are non-experimental in nature.    ,NCT00001182
Healthy,Endocrine Studies of Healthy Children, Researchers would like to determine normal ranges for hormone levels and to learn more about the genetics involved in hormone production and action. Researchers will take samples of blood urine saliva and stool from healthy children ages 5-17 in order to study different aspects of hormones. Establishing a range of normal hormone levels in children will make diagnosing illnesses with abnormal levels of hormones much easier. Hormone levels in the body can change throughout the day. By collecting samples at different times researchers hope to learn more about the normal daytime and nighttime patterns of hormone secretion. Because some hormone levels change with body size researchers will also take measurements of patient's body composition. This study will involve children and observe them as inpatients or as outpatients. <TAB>    ,NCT00001195
Healthy,Evaluation of Neuromuscular Disease, The peripheral nervous system is the portion of the nervous system outside of the brain and spinal cord. It includes the 12 pairs of cranial nerves 31 pairs of spinal nerves and their branches nerves responsible for sensation and maintenance of normal body functions (sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves). Years of research using clinical examinations microscopic examinations and electrophysiology have made the peripheral nervous system the best-studied and most available portion of the nervous system. However even with all of the extensive studies conducted on the peripheral nervous system many conditions remain unclassified. The EMG Laboratory at the NIH concentrates on studying disorders of the peripheral nervous system. This protocol was designed to allow the EMG Laboratory to; I) Learn more about established diseases of the peripheral nervous system II) Identify and characterize new diseases of the peripheral nervous system III) Assess current techniques in the diagnosis of diseases of the peripheral nervous system IV) Refine old methods and develop new ones for the diagnosis of diseases of the peripheral nervous system.    ,NCT00001201
Healthy,Development of Normative Ultrasound Databases of Tongue Surface Configuration, Our past ultrasound research has indicated a need for baseline normative tongue data against which to compare our disordered speech populations. Subjects with normal speech and hearing who represent different ages and sexes will be studied with respect to tongue shape and movement patterns. Recently developed parameters such as curve fitting curve averaging and polar coordinates will be used to create baseline data categories. In addition new parameters and improved instruments will be developed as previously to produce a data base which can be used across disciplines.    ,NCT00001218
Healthy,Lipoprotein Metabolism in Normal Volunteers and Patients With Abnormal Levels of Lipoproteins, Researchers plan to study the fat-rich particles called lipoproteins which circulate in the blood. This study is designed to improve understanding of normal as well as abnormal lipoprotein metabolism and the role it plays in the development of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Patients participating in this study will receive an intravenous (directly into the vein) injection of a small amount of specially prepared amino acids. The amino acids being injected are the same amino acids present in a normal diet. The amount of amino acid given will be less than the amount eaten in a protein-rich meal. The amino acids will be labeled with nonradioactive heavy isotopes which are also present in the environment n low amounts. Patients participating in the study will be required to have blood samples taken and provide urine samples throughout the course of the study. In addition patient will be required to follow a specially formulated diet. Patients will be weighed throughout the course of the study.    ,NCT00001226
Healthy,Human Movement Database, This study will collect information on the different ways people control limb and body movements. This information will be used to develop a database on normal movements and adaptive movements of people who have diseases that affect the way they move. The database will serve as a tool to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients with movement-related problems. Volunteers over the age of 4 who have normal movement patterns or who have developed different ways to perform movement tasks may be eligible for this study. A physical therapist will screen candidates to determine their strength flexibility and range of motion of joints. Participants will be asked to perform movements such as walking walking up or down stairs standing quietly or reaching for an object. For the test the arms and legs are wrapped with a soft rubber-like material to which small plastic reflective balls are attached. A piece of firm material called a shell may be attached to the rubber sleeves or other areas of the body. Then the volunteer performs the specified task several times while special cameras record the movement. The cameras only record the positions of the reflective balls during movement not the person s face or body. Electrical activity in the muscles also may be measured using small metal electrodes attached to the surface of the skin with an adhesive bandage.    ,NCT00001252
Healthy,Studies of Frontal Lobe Brain Functioning in Schizophrenia, The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to investigate the role of the frontal lobe of the brain in the thinking of individuals with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders and healthy volunteers. Participants in this study will undergo a positron emission tomography (PET) scan of the brain while performing neuropsychological tests. Some of the tests involve cognitive operations that depend upon the frontal cortex. Interactions between frontal lobe activation cognitive behavior and neuropharmacology will be assessed by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during treatment with drugs that may affect frontal lobe physiology.    ,NCT00001258
Healthy,Effects of Endotoxin in Normal Human Volunteers, Bacterial infections can progress to a life-threatening illness called septic shock characterized by low blood pressure and vital organ damage. The syndrome is thought to be caused by parts of the bacteria and by the body s own immune response to the infection. A major bacterial product that interacts with the immune defenses is called endotoxin. This study will examine the body s response to endotoxin in the lungs or bloodstream. When endotoxin is given in small amounts to humans even though it is not an infection it triggers a set of responses that are typical of what one would see with a true bacterial infection. This allows us to study the earliest changes in molecules and cells that are involved in some bacterial infections. This type of model is safe and has been used in humans for many years to understand the body s responses during infections. Normal volunteers 18 to 45 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a history and physical examination blood and urine tests electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest X-ray. In addition volunteers 40 to 45 years old will have an exercise stress test to screen for asymptomatic coronary artery disease. Participants will undergo one or more of the following procedures: Bronchoscopy Bronchoalveolar Lavage Bronchial Brushings and Endobronchial Mucosal Biopsies: These techniques for examining lung function are used routinely in patient care and clinical research. The mouth and nasal and lung airways are numbed with an anesthetic. A bronchoscope (pencil-thin flexible tube) is then passed through the nose into the large airways of the lung. Cells and secretions from the airways are rinsed with salt water (bronchoalveolar lavage) and a flexible brush the size of a pencil tip is passed through the bronchoscope to scrape cells lining the airways. Lastly pieces of tissue (the size of the ball of a ballpoint pen) lining the airways are removed for examination under the microscope. Intravenous Endotoxin: A small dose of endotoxin is injected into a vein. Blood samples are drawn at regular intervals for 8 hours after the injection and again after 1 2 3 7 and 14 days to analyze the body s immune response to the bacteria in the blood. Instilled Endotoxin in the Lungs: A small amount (2 teaspoons) of salt water is squirted through a bronchoscope into a lobe of one lung and then salt water containing a small dose of endotoxin is squirted into the other lung. Bronchial lavage brushing and biopsy (see above) are then done to study the response of the lung to the endotoxin. In addition air is withdrawn through the bronchoscope to study air components from the lung that was instilled with salt water or endotoxin. Nitric Oxide Therapy: Endotoxin is instilled in a lung (see above) and then nitric oxide a colorless odorless tasteless gas mixed with room air in a concentration of 40 parts per million is given through a cushioned mask placed over the mouth and nose. (Some participants will be given the nitric oxide mixture and others will breathe only room air through the mask to test the effects of the nitric oxide on the lung inflammation.) The mask will be worn continuously for 6 hours and removed before repeat bronchoscopy with lavage brushing and biopsy. Some of the above procedures require placement of a catheter (thin plastic tube) in a wrist artery to monitor blood pressure from heartbeat to heartbeat and to collect blood samples. First the skin is numbed with an anesthetic (lidocaine). A needle is then inserted into the artery the catheter is slipped over the needle into the vessel and the needle is removed.    ,NCT00001303
Healthy,Positron Emission Tomography to Measure Pain and Pain Control, This study will examine how the brain processes pain signals and how the different parts of the brain work with each other in response to painful stimuli. A better understanding of how people experience pain may be helpful in developing more effective treatments. Healthy normal volunteers patients requiring third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction and patients with persistent pain due to disease injury or other reason may be eligible for this study. Participants will receive one or more of the following sensory stimuli which may cause brief discomfort or pain:   -  Heat/Cold - applied by an electronically controlled device that touches the skin or by temperature-controlled water baths or by a thermally controlled brass cylinder the subject grasps   -  Capsaicin (active ingredient in hot chili peppers) - injected in a small volume of fluid under the skin or into a muscle   -  Mechanical stimulation - brushings or vibrations that do not normally cause pain   -  Ischemic stimulation - inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the arm or leg for up to 30 minutes These stimuli will be applied both before and during positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. This test shows which parts of the brain are active and which are not and is important for studying how different parts of the brain work together to feel and react to specific sensations. For this procedure the subject lies on a table in the PET scanner while a series of scans are taken during different sensory conditions. At the beginning of each scan radioactive water is injected into an arm vein through a catheter (a thin plastic tube). A special camera records the arrival and disappearance of the radiation in various brain areas creating a picture of the brain's activity in various regions. Oral surgery patients may have PET scans both before and after their wisdom tooth extraction. Alfentanil a commonly used narcotic pain reliever will also be given during the PET procedure to determine how the brain responds to sensory stimuli while under the effects of a pain killer. Participants will also have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain to help interpret the PET results. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the scan the subject lies on a table in a cylindrical machine (the scanner). He or she can speak with a staff member via an intercom system. Some sensory studies may require placing an arterial and/or intravenous line. Following injection of a local anesthetic a catheter is placed in an artery in the arm. At regular intervals during various sensory stimuli small blood samples are drawn from the artery to measure blood gases and other substances. Samples may also be drawn from a catheter placed in a vein. Subjects may also have ultrasound monitoring to evaluate blood flow in the arteries veins and brain. A gel is spread over the skin above the blood vessel and a hand-foot-and-mouth device is placed on the gel. The device emits high-frequency sound waves to produce a picture of the speed of blood flow in the artery and the diameter of the vessel.    ,NCT00001307
Healthy,Treatment of Non-Tuberculous Mycobacterial Infections With Interferon Gamma, This is an open label study to determine the effects of the administration of Interferon-gamma on the clinical condition and immune function of patients with severe treatment refractory non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infections. The study drug (interferon gamma) will be administered subcutaneously three times a week at 0.05 mg/m(2) for one year. We may also collect blood from the relatives of these patients and normal volunteers in order to characterize the genetic basis if any of our patients' disorders.    ,NCT00001318
Healthy,Neuroimaging of Dopamine Metabolism in Normal and Psychiatric Patients," Brain cells communicate with each other by releasing chemicals called neurotransmitters. In order for brain cells to transfer information one cell will release a neurotransmitter that will be recognized by a receptor located on surface of another cell. One such neurotransmitter is dopamine. Abnormal dopamine transmission has been seen in patients with substance abuse and different neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. A radioactive drug called IZBM (I-123 iodobenzamide) can also bind to certain dopamine receptors. IZBM can be seen by Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT). Therefore by using IZBM and SPECT scans researchers can find and ""map"" the location of dopamine receptors in the brain. Patients participating in this study must also have been selected for other genetic studies being conducted at the NIMH. Patients with schizophrenia will be selected from a NIMH research study titled ""Neurobiological Investigation of Patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders and Their Siblings"" (95-M-0150). Normal patient volunteers will be selected from another NIMH study titled ""Inpatient Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Patients"" (89-M-0160). All aspects of clinical care and genetic analysis of these patients will be covered in these studies while information pertaining to IBZM SPECT scans will be covered in this study. This study will not directly benefit patients participating in it. However information gathered may contribute to faster and more accurate diagnosis of schizophrenia and eventually better treatment for the disorder.    ",NCT00001320
Healthy,Salivary Evaluation in Healthy Volunteers, Saliva is critical in maintaining oral health and comfort. Our laboratory has investigated several disorders of salivary glands. The purpose of this protocol is to obtain data from healthy volunteers for comparison with data from patients with salivary dysfunction. We plan to utilize the NIH Clinical Center Clinical Research Volunteer Program to solicit paid participation from healthy adults. Study procedures are accomplished in 2-3 outpatient visits that include an interview saliva collection lip biopsy clinical laboratory studies dry eye examination and lip biopsy follow up as needed. These are routine diagnostic procedures. Biopsy specimens may be used in clinical and laboratory studies such as in vitro biochemical analysis or in vivo transplantation. Some of the Healthy Volunteers may be asked to participate in an MRI study of the salivary glands.    ,NCT00001390
Healthy,Bone Mineral Density in Women With Major Depression, The purpose of this study is to examine calcium absorption and bone mineral density in women with depression. Research indicates that pre-menopausal women with depression have significantly lower bone mineral density (BMD) than pre-menopausal women without depression. Although the mechanisms of BMD loss are unclear researchers believe that individuals with depression have impaired calcium absorption. However it is unknown whether the abnormal absorption is a result of depression or a side effect of the drugs used to treat it. This study will compare calcium absorption in women with depression and in healthy women without depression. Participants in this study will be given two non-radioactive calcium isotopes. One can be taken by mouth and the other must be injected. Participants will have the level of isotopes in their urine measured to estimate true fractional calcium absorption (TFCA). Participants may also have a dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to measure total body adiposity and lean body mass.    ,NCT00001413
Healthy,Evaluation of Healthy Volunteer Marrow Donors Participating in the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)," Individuals interested in becoming prospective bone marrow donors and joining the Registry of the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) should do so by calling 301-496-0572 the phone number of the NIH Marrow Donor Center. An appointment will be made to have a health history taken and to have a buccal swab collected for tissue (HLA) typing. The current protocol only involves donors already registered with the NMDP who have been identified as ""perfect matches"" for an unrelated patient requiring a bone marrow transplant and who require expedited medical evaluation prior to marrow collection.    ",NCT00001451
Healthy,Effect of High Levels of Oxygen and Smoking on the Lungs in Human Volunteers," Patients with lung disease experiencing difficulty breathing can be treated with oxygen therapy. This involves the delivery of ""extra"" oxygen by a face-mask or through small tubes placed in the nose called nasal prongs. This extra oxygen can have concentrations as high as 100% pure oxygen. The concentration of oxygen in normal air is only 21%. The high concentration of oxygen can help to provide enough oxygen for all of the organs in the body. Unfortunately breathing 100% oxygen for long periods of time can cause changes in the lungs which are potentially harmful. Researchers believe that by lowering the concentration of oxygen therapy to 40% patients can receive it for longer periods of time without the risk of side effects. This study is designed to evaluate the effects of oxygen therapy at 100% and 40% for 12 18 hours on the lungs of normal volunteers. Results of this study will help to determine if levels of oxygen therapy currently accepted as being ""safe"" may actually be damaging to the lungs.    ",NCT00001464
Healthy,Genetic Analysis of Immune Disorders, The purposes of this study are to 1) identify the genes responsible for certain immune disorders 2) learn about the medical problems they cause and 3) learn how to predict who is likely to develop these disorders and what the risk is of passing them on to children. The immune system is the body s defense system. Some immune deficiencies impair a person s ability to fight infections; others render a person susceptible to allergies or to autoimmune diseases such as lupus or arthritis in which the immune cells (white blood cells) attack and destroy the body s own tissues. Patients with immune disorders known or suspected to have a genetic basis and their family members may enroll in this study. Eligibility will be determined by a review of the patient s medical records and family medical history. Participants will provide a small blood sample for genetic (DNA) and white blood cell analysis. Gene samples (but not white blood cells) may also be obtained by mouth brushing or skin biopsy. For the mouth brushing a small brush is rubbed against the inside of the cheeks for 1 minute to wipe off some cells. For the skin biopsy a small circle of skin (about 1/8 inch) is removed under local anesthetic. Pregnant women may be asked to provide a fetal sample (amniotic fluid cells or chorionic villus sample). All samples will be used for immune or genetic studies of the family s immune disorder. If test results show a specific genetic variation responsible for the family s immune disorder a report will be sent to the patient s doctor or genetic counselor who will discuss the implications for the family. NIH researchers and genetic counselors will also be available to explain results and answer questions. Information will not be available in the case of disorders that cannot yet be linked to a specific genetic abnormality. Information from this study will increase knowledge about the immune system and what causes immune deficiencies. Participants may also learn the underlying cause of an immune disorder that affects them or someone in their family information may be useful in guiding treatment and in making decisions regarding family planning.    ,NCT00001467
Healthy,Effects of Drugs on Cerebral Blood Flow in Patients With Mood Disorders, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique used to investigate the functional activity of the brain. The PET technique allows doctors to study the normal biochemical and metabolic processes of the central nervous system of normal individuals and patients with neurologic illnesses without physical / structural damage to the brain. When a region of the brain is active it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar (glucose). As the brain uses more fuel it produces more waste products carbon dioxide and water. Blood carries fuel to the brain and waste products away from the brain. As brain activity increases blood flow to and from the area of activity increases also. Knowing these facts researchers can use radioactive chemicals (H215O) and PET scans to observe what areas of the brain are receiving more blood flow. Patients diagnosed with mood disorders and healthy volunteers will receive positron emission tomographic (PET) scans with H215O while doing simple tasks. Patients will continue to receive scans while in different mood states and while taking different medications. Patients eligible for this study will be participating in other research studies measuring other clinical and biochemical parameters (mood and anxiety ratings medication responses and psychological test results). Information gathered from H215O PET scans measuring blood flow to specific brain areas will be compared to the data gathered from other studies. Objectives of this study are;   1. To determine differences in blood flow to the brain of patients with mood disorders compared to healthy volunteers.   2. To determine differences in blood flow to the brain of patients with subtype mood disorders (such as unipolar versus bipolar) compared to healthy volunteers. 2. To determine changes in blood flow to the brain of patients with mood disorders who experience spontaneous changes in symptoms 3. To determine changes in blood flow to the brain of patients with mood disorders who receive various kinds of therapy (medication transcranial magnetic stimulation etc.) 4. To determine if blood flow to specific areas of the brain can be used to predict how patients will respond to certain types of therapy 5. To compare blood flow changes with various other clinical and biochemical parameters.    ,NCT00001478
Healthy,Oxygen Uptake Kinetics During Recovery From Maximal and Submaximal Exercise, Measurements of dynamic changes in oxygen uptake (VO2 kinetics) during recovery from exercise may describe regulatory control of oxygen transport and utilization and have greater reliability and less inherent risk than assessment of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in patients for whom exercise is limited by pain excessive fatigue dyspnea and motivation. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of exercise intensity on the time constant describing changes in VO2 (tauVO2) during recovery from one minute of constant work rate exercise. Five normal healthy volunteers ages 18 and older will perform a progressive maximal aerobic exercise test using a cycle ergometer to determine VO2max and lactate threshold (LT) estimated by gas exchange. Each subject will also complete a series of maximal constant work rate tests and submaximal constant work rate tests at 80% LT and 50% of the difference between LT and VO2max (50% delta). Breath by breath variability and VO2 span will be used to determine the number of constant work rate test repetitions for each subject for each exercise intensity needed to establish confidence in tauVO2. A mean response profile of VO2 recovery kinetics for each exercise intensity will be analyzed using non-linear regression to determine tauVO2. To examine the effect of exercise intensity on tauVO2 one way analysis of variance will be used to determine whether differences exist among maximal and submaximal (80% LT and 50% delta) time constants. We hypothesize that there will be no significant differences among time constants for VO2 during recovery from maximal and submaximal constant work rate exercise lasting one minute. The results of this study are expected to provide increased understanding of the measurement of VO2 kinetics during recovery.    ,NCT00001519
Healthy,Analysis of Heart Muscle Function Following Exercise in Patients With Heart Disease, This study is designed to examine the blood flow the nutrition and the beating function of the heart under different conditions. Patients with narrowed coronary arteries my have restricted blood flow to the heart. The lowered blood supply to the heart muscle may not cause symptoms immediately. However as the heart pumps faster and harder the blood supply demand is increased. If blood flow is unable supply enough oxygen and nutrition to heart muscle patients can experience symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. Even after the heart slows down and demand for oxygen and nutrition is reduced patients can still experience pain and abnormal heart function. The purpose of this study is to determine the changes in blood flow and the beating function of the heart during periods of increased demands (such as exercise) and shortly after stopping exercise. Blood flow to the heart will be measured by positron emission tomography (PET scan). The PET scan is a test where a small amount of radioactive water is injected into the bloodstream and pictures of the heart are taken by the special camera. This procedure allows researchers to measure blood flow to heart muscle. In order to measure nutrition (metabolism) of the heart muscle researchers will use a radioactive substance similar to sugar (Fluorodeoxyglucose). Results of this study may provide important information about the activity and function of heart muscle after exercise in patients suffering from coronary artery disease.    ,NCT00001528
Healthy,Dynamics of Leptin and Endocrine Function, This is a study investigating the hormones and substances important to the stress response. The hormone that is most directly responsible for stress response is called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH is produced in the hypothalamus of the brain and causes the pituitary gland to produce another hormone called ACTH. The hormone ACTH then acts on the adrenal glands causing them to produce the hormone cortisol. Unfortunately CRH levels are unable to be measured in simple blood samples. However substances like cortisol and leptin can provide information as to the activity of the hypothalamus. The hormone leptin is associated with the regulation of body weight and the normal maintenance of bodily functions (homeostasis). It is found in fat cell (adipocyes) and communicates the nutritional status of the body to the brain (central nervous system). Research using animals has shown that defects in the communication between leptin and the brain causes obesity (the state of being overweight). It has also been noted that obese humans tend to have high levels of leptin. By studying patients with abnormal genes responsible for leptin production researchers have found that a least one leptin gene must be intact for the normal secretion of hormones to proceed. These results show that the hormone leptin is produced outside of the brain in fat cells and acts directly on the function of the hypothalamus within the brain. Researchers believe that leptin plays a key role in the normal release of hormones from the HPA axis. Researchers intend on continuing to study the role of leptin in fat distribution and the activity of the HPA axis in normal volunteers. In addition this study will focus on the role of leptin in depression because depression is characterized by changes in food intake body weight and neuroendocrine function. Data gathered from this study will provide a better understanding of the causes and medical consequences of major depression.    ,NCT00001543
Healthy,Functional and Metabolic Imaging Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy, Technical advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have provided researchers with the opportunity to study changes of the central nervous system (CNS) and improve diagnosis and therapy of CNS disease. New MRI and MRS techniques specifically designed for functional MRI (fMRI) and MRS imaging of the CNS will be evaluated in normal volunteers and in patients with CNS diseases. This study will develop and evaluate new magnetic resonance pulse sequences for performing MRI or MRS and compare the results to existing MR techniques. Patients and volunteers age 18 and older are eligible for the study. A history will be taken in which exclusion criteria (such as having a pacemaker or cochlear implants) will be addressed and a pregnancy test will be administered to women of childbearing age. Each subject will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire. Study participants will lie in the MRI scanner from 20 minutes to 2 hours. A coil may be placed on the head and participants may be asked to do simple or complex tasks. A catheter will be placed in an arm vein and a contrast agent will be administered. This agent will allow structures in the brain to show up more clearly.    ,NCT00001591
Healthy,Pain Measurement in Healthy Volunteers, This study will attempt to develop and validate improved subjective measures of pain sensation and use these measures to evaluate pain sensitivity in patients. Normal healthy volunteers and dental patients undergoing third molar extraction may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo the following procedures: Volunteers: Volunteers will participate in two 90-minute sessions in which they will receive and rate four heat stimuli per minute applied to the skin for a maximum of 36 minutes. The heat stimuli range from 37° (Degree)C to 51° (Degree)C (99° (Degree) F to 124° (Degree) F) and last 2 to 3 seconds. A drug commonly used in dental treatments may be administered during the second session. This will be either a maximum of 0.15 mg fentanyl a short-acting narcotic pain killer or a maximum of 5 mg saline an inactive substance (placebo). Dental patients: Dental patients will participate in two 60-minute sessions. The first session will be on the day before the third molar extraction and the second session will be immediately before the dental procedure. The heat stimulus procedure will be identical to that described above for normal healthy volunteers.    ,NCT00001597
Healthy,Normal Human Electro-Oculogram, This study will measure the normal range of the human electro-oculogram (EOG) in people of various age groups. EOGs are recordings of electrical signals generated by the retina (the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye) when going from a dark to a bright environment. They provide valuable information about the function of the eye in health and disease. A knowledge of what results are to be expected in tests of normal healthy eyes will be valuable in assessing EOG results in patients with known or suspected retinal diseases. Normal volunteers from ages 6 to 65 who have healthy eyes and normal eyesight will participate in this study. Candidates will undergo tests to check vision and the health of the eye. Study participants will then have an electro-oculogram. In this test eye drops are placed in the eye to enlarge the pupils. Two electrodes (small disks that picks up electrical signals) are attached to the left and right of each eye and one to the forehead. (These are similar to electrodes placed on the body during an electrocardiogram (ECG) which measures electrical signals from the heart.) During the EOG recording the volunteer looks at the inside of a hollow sphere following with their eyes small red lights that turn on and off. The background light is also turned on or off during the test. Some volunteers may be asked to repeat the EOG at another time. Study participants may also be asked to provide a blood sample for tests to study how the immune cells in the blood respond to proteins found in the retina. The response from normal volunteers will be compared with that of patients with eye diseases like retinitis pigmentosa.    ,NCT00001610
Healthy,Study of the Response of Human Small Blood Vessels, A layer of cells called the endothelium line the walls of blood vessels. These cells produce substances that control the tone of blood vessels and thus control blood flow through the vessel. One of the substances produced involved in the control of blood vessel function is nitric oxide. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in the relaxation of blood vessels. Researchers have been interested in the function of the endothelium in patients with high blood pressure (essential hypertension) and patients with high cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia). After conducting studies on the endothelium and nitric oxide researchers have found that the endothelium is indeed functioning abnormally in patients with high blood pressure and high cholesterol. In addition researchers have determined that the dysfunction is a result of abnormalities in the nitric oxide (NO) system. In this study researchers plan to investigate the relationship between blood vessel responses in real-life settings versus laboratory settings in normal volunteers patients with high blood pressure and patients with high cholesterol.    ,NCT00001622
Healthy,Investigation Into the Use of Ultrasound Technique in the Evaluation of Heart Disease, The human heart is divided into four chambers. One of the four chambers the left ventricle is the chamber mainly responsible for pumping blood out of the heart into the circulation. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetically inherited disease causing an abnormal thickening of heart muscle especially the muscle making up the left ventricle. When the left ventricle becomes abnormally large it is called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Patients with HCM can be born with an enlarged left ventricle or they may develop the condition in childhood or adolescence usually during the time when the body is rapidly growing. However not all patients with the abnormal genes linked to HCM have the characteristic LVH. Currently it is impossible to tell if a patient with the genes for HCM will develop LVH. A recently developed ultrasound tool called an integrated backscatter analysis (IBS) may allow researchers to determine those children who may later develop HCM and LVH. In order to test this researchers plan to use IBS to study normal children with relatives diagnosed with HCM. This study will compare the results of IBS done on normal children with relatives diagnosed with HCM  normal children and children with evidence enlarged heart muscle (HCM).    ,NCT00001632
Healthy,Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Ofl Volunteers, Magnetic resonance is an imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of the body. The technology used in magnetic resonance imaging continues to improve. Advancements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires researchers to study new techniques in normal volunteers in order to understand how to use them in patients with diseases. In this study researchers plan to do a variety of diagnostic tests including magnetic resonance imaging on normal volunteers. The studies may involve injections of contrast media substances injected into the blood of participant that improves the image created by the MRI scanner. The study is not expected to benefit the participants. However information gathered from the study may be used to improve diagnostic techniques and develop new research studies.    ,NCT00001711
Healthy,Magnetization Transfer Quantitation and Characterization for Clinical Scanners, This project will measure magnetization transfer (MT) parameters on normal subjects using two novel approaches. The first is the investigation of asymmetric MT effects with respect to the zero or on-resonance reference point. The technique measures the difference in MT effect between two symmetrically positioned off-resonance MT pulses in the positive and negative frequency ranges. Prior research with this technique in the kidney show a difference in the macromolecular lineshape that correlates to a specific metabolite. The second approach utilizing a subset of the acquisitions from the first approach will test newly developed formulation to calculate the macromolecular fraction or fraction of proton density that accounts for MT. We foresee these measurements may significantly develop our understanding of MT and introduce diagnostic and quantitative tools to study human tissues.    ,NCT00001714
Healthy,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Blood Flow in the Liver and Abdomen, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine blood flow patterns in the arteries and veins of the liver and abdomen. It will 1) determine the best way to measure blood flow in these vessels and 2) make detailed measurements of the blood flow patterns of these vessels. Information about normal liver blood flow may help explain the role of blood flow in liver disease. Normal healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. They will undergo MRI-a diagnostic tool that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to show structural and chemical changes in tissue and the speed of moving blood. The patient lies on a stretcher inside a metal cylinder (the scanner) for 1 to 1.5 hours and will be required to lie very still for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Blood pressure heart rate breathing and the amount of oxygen in the fingertip are measured during the scan.    ,NCT00001719
Healthy,Fat Tissue Microperfusion to Measure Leptin Secretion and Its Relations With Fat Breakdown in Humans, Leptin is a hormone that acts in the body as a chemical messenger. It is produced in fat cells and is believed to regulate body weight in humans. Leptin decreases appetite and influences the energy balance of the body. This study will attempt to measure levels of leptin production in the fat pad of the body by using a process called microperfusion. Microperfusion works by inserting 2 to 3 probes (thin tubes) into the fat pad around the belly button. These probes can measure chemicals in an area known as the extracellular space. This is the small space between cells and blood vessels that hormones medicines nutrients and salts travel through. The study will investigate the effects of a meal insulin glucose (sugar) and the medication isoproterenol on leptin levels. Researchers believe that leptin levels are regulated along with the enzyme hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). When hormone sensitive lipase is activated fat is broken down in a process called lipolysis. In addition increased levels of HSL result in decreased levels of leptin which in turn increases appetite and food intake.    ,NCT00001722
Healthy,The Role of Cyclooxygenase Activity in the Endothelial Function of Hypertensive and Hypercholesterolemic Patients, A layer of cells called the endothelium line the walls of blood vessels. These cells produce substances that control the tone of blood vessels and thus control blood flow through the vessel. This regulating activity of the endothelium is dysfunctional in several diseases of the heart and blood vessels including high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol. Previous research has pointed toward a decrease in the action of nitric oxide (NO) as the cause of this abnormality. Nitric oxide is a substance produced by the cells of the endothelium that plays a role in the relaxation of blood vessels. In this project researchers plan to study blood flow through the blood vessels in patients forearms after receiving four different drugs: sodium nitroprusside acetylcholine L-NMMA and aspirin. These four drugs act on the blood vessels of the forearm through different mechanisms. Acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside are drugs that open the blood vessels of the forearm and increase blood flow through the vessel. L-NMMA is a drug that blocks production of nitric oxide (NO). Aspirin's role in controlling blood flow is unknown. Patients participating in this research study will not directly benefit from it. However the study will contribute to researchers understanding of diseases of the blood vessels and heart.    ,NCT00001742
Healthy,Study of the Effects of Temperature on Metabolism in Human Muscle, This study will examine the role of temperature in changing energy metabolism in human muscle. In order to do this researchers will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide information about how parts of muscle operate during exercise. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic tool that creates high quality images of the human body without the use of X-ray (radiation). In this study MRI will be used to measure the temperature and energy level of specific muscles during rest and exercise. In addition the muscles being tested will be heated and cooled to see if temperature directly affects levels of energy in muscle.    ,NCT00001753
Healthy,I-123 Brain Studies of Serotonin Metabolism in Psychiatric Patients and Normal Volunteers, Abnormalities in the re-uptake of dopamine and serotonin have been described in various neuropsychiatric disorders and substance abuse. [I-123] Beta-CIT is a recently developed radioligand for SPECT imaging of dopamine and serotonin transporters. [I-123]Beta-CIT SPECT has been used at the SPECT-lab of the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch in over fifty subjects without adverse events. Due to the trace concentrations used a pharmacological effect of Beta-CIT is unlikely and has not been observed. The purpose of this study is to use Beta-CIT and SPECT to study the expression of dopamine and serotonin transporters in vivo in normal controls and various patient populations to address hypothesized abnormalities of the transporters in different disorders and to understand the effects of genetic variations in the genes of these transporters on their in vivo expression.    ,NCT00001771
Healthy,G-CSF for Granulocyte Donation, This study will examine the feasibility of giving cell growth stimulants to granulocyte donors the same day of donation rather than the day before. People who donate granulocytes (infection-fighting white blood cells) for transfusion to patients with severe white cell deficiencies are often given a steroid called dexamethasone and a growth factor called G-CSF the day before donation. These drugs stimulate white cell production allowing many more cells to be collected than would otherwise be possible. A single dose of G-CSF given to healthy people increases their white cells counts by four to five times the next day. It would be preferable however to give G-CSF the same day of donation if possible. Therefore this study will measure white cell counts in healthy people at various intervals after being injected with G-CSF alone and G-CSF with dexamethasone. The study will compare the following: granulocyte counts at seven different intervals after injection of the drug or drugs; the effects of G-CSF injected through a vein or under the skin; and the effects of giving G-CSF alone or with dexamethasone. Each participant will undergo four procedures each four weeks apart as follows: donate a small blood sample; receive an injection of G-CSF under the skin or into a vein; and take either two dexamethasone tablets or two placebo tablets. Small blood samples will then be drawn 1 2 4 6 8 and 24 hours after the drugs are given. Participants will answer questions about how they feel before the drugs are given and at the various intervals after taking the drugs.    ,NCT00001842
Healthy,Study of New Magnetic Resonance Methods, This study will evaluate new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) methods using a MRI machine more powerful than those in most hospitals. MRI is a diagnostic tool that uses a large magnet and radio waves to produce images of the human body. It can also provide information about brain chemistry and physiology. This study will use the new MRI hardware and methods to measure blood flow and metabolism in regions of the brain during simple tasks such as listening to tones or watching flashing checkerboards. Healthy normal volunteers will undergo MRI scanning. For this procedure the person lies on a stretcher that is moved into a MRI machine which produces a strong magnetic field. A special lightweight coil is placed on the person's head to obtain better pictures. The scan time ranges from 20 minutes to 2 hours with the average scan lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. During the MRI the person may be asked to perform simple tasks such as listening to tones or watching a screen tapping fingers or moving a hand. More complex tasks may require thinking about tones or pictures and responding to them by pressing buttons. The images produced in this study will be compared with those produced using standard MRI. The results will be used to develop improved imaging methods for better patient care and research.    ,NCT00001844
Healthy,Study of Brain Blood Flow During Induced Hypercapnia (Excess Blood Carbon Dioxide), This study will evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) methods for measuring changes in the brain's blood flow during hypercapnia (a condition of excess carbon dioxide in the blood). MRI is a diagnostic tool that uses a large magnet and radio waves to produce images of the body without X-rays. Healthy normal volunteers in this study may have as many as six MRI scans over a 2-year period. For this procedure the person lies on a stretcher placed in a strong magnetic field produced by the MRI machine. During the scan the person's blood carbon dioxide (CO2 ) levels will be increased either by: 1) breathing air mixtures containing up to 5% CO2; or 2) receiving an intravenous (I.V.) injection of a drug called acetazolamide. Persons who breathe CO2 will have their heart rate blood pressure and oxygen levels monitored throughout the procedure. Those receiving acetazolamide will have the drug injected intravenously (I.V.) into an arm vein. If the volunteer experiences any unpleasant side effects from the CO2 or acetazolamide the study will be stopped. The information gained from this study will be used to develop better ways to study brain function possibly leading to better diagnostic and treatment methods.    ,NCT00001845
Healthy,Quality Control of Cardiopulmonary Exercise Equipment, This study is designed to make sure exercise equipment used by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute is working properly. Healthy volunteers will be requested to use P-CCMB cardiopulmonary exercise equipment (treadmills and exercise bicycles) two times a month to ensure the machines are functioning properly.    ,NCT00001883
Healthy,Identification of Genes Associated With Lung Disease in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis, Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a condition in which the lungs of a patient become scarred and fibrous. It has been known to occur in as many as 40% of patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The cause of the pulmonary fibrosis in patients with RA is unknown. Data gathered from previous research studies suggest that genetics may play a role in the development of PF in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However the actual genetic factors involved in the disease process have not been identified. The goal of this study is to identify the genetic markers in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis.    ,NCT00001885
Healthy,Neuroimaging of St. John's Wort-Induced Changes of Serotonin Metabolism in Normal Subjects, St. John's Wort is a popular dietary supplement that many people take to elevate mood or relieve stress. This study will test in normal volunteers whether this preparation may alter mood and if so by what means. Animal studies suggest that St. John's Wort may work similarly to some antidepressants that affect levels of the chemical serotonin in the brain. Participants in this study must also be enrolled in NIMH protocol #98-M-0094 (SPECT Imaging of Dopamine and Serotonin Transporters in Neuropsychiatric Patients and Normal Volunteers) and protocol #91-M-014 (MRI Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Patients and Controls). Separate consent forms are required for each study. Candidates will undergo medical and psychiatric evaluations that may include blood and urine tests electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram. Normal volunteers will have a mood assessment at the beginning of the study. They will then be randomly assigned to take either placebo (a pill with no active ingredient) or St. John's Wort 3 times a day for 2 weeks and will be told what they are taking. After an 11-week hiatus they will again start treatment on the same schedule but will not be told which preparation they are receiving. Each evening during the 2-week treatment periods subjects will complete a brief self-rating mood assessment questionnaire. At the end of each treatment period they will undergo SPECT brain imaging (a type of CT scan) to determine dopamine and serotonin distribution and density in the brain. For this procedure study subjects take three drops of potassium iodide solution within 24 hours before the scan and two drops nightly for 3 days following the procedure. About 10 ml (less than two teaspoons) of blood are drawn before a radioactive tracer is injected. SPECT imaging is done the next day. After about 1 hour of imaging subjects are given either a placebo or St. John's Wort and then imaging continues for another 2 hours. During the procedure up to five blood samples of 6 ml each may be drawn. At some point during the study a MRI scan of the brain will be done.    ,NCT00001919
Healthy,Eye Blink Response in Healthy Volunteers and Adults With Schizophrenia, The purpose of this study is to explore how the brain works during particular memory tasks in people with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers. Research has shown that patients with schizophrenia have structural and functional abnormalities in the hippocampus and cerebellum of their brains. These abnormalities are likely associated with the memory impairment experienced by these patients. Eye blink tests can provide information about memory acquisition involving the cerebellar and hippocampal regions. By altering the stimuli interval these tests can distinguish between cerebellum-dependent memory associated with subliminal mnemonic encoding and hippocampus-dependent memory associated with conscious awareness. This study will use eyeblink tests to determine which type of memory is predominantly affected in schizophrenia. Participants in this study will be screened with a physical and psychiatric examination. Participants will have an electroencephalogram (EEG) an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an electrodermal test. Evoked potentials and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain may also be taken.    ,NCT00001920
Healthy,Electrophysiology and Blood Flow in Patients With Schizophrenia and Their Siblings, This study will explore how the brain works during memory testing in an effort to understand why some patients with schizophrenia have memory difficulties. Patients with schizophrenia and their unaffected family members are eligible for this study. Studying family members may help identify the genes related to the memory deficit in schizophrenia. Normal volunteers will also be studied. Normal volunteers patients with schizophrenia and their family members interested in participating in this study will be screened with a complete medical examination and psychiatric assessment and performance of simple tasks. Study participants will be shown numbers on a screen and asked to recall them after a brief period. This will be done during electroencephalographic (EEG) recording in which electrodes attached to the scalp measure the brain s electrical activity. The same test will be repeated while the patient has magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. The combined MRI and EEG testing will permit better localization of the brain s electrical activity.    ,NCT00001921
Healthy,Hormone Replacement in Young Women With Premature Ovarian Failure, The human ovary produces male sex hormones (androgen) and female sex hormones (estrogen). Currently androgen is not included in hormone replacement therapy for women with premature ovarian failure. Present hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was designed to treat women who experience ovarian failure at menopause (around the age of 50). However 1% of women will experience premature failure of the ovaries before the age of 40. There have been no studies conducted to determine proper hormone replacement therapies for these younger women. Some research suggests that the usual menopausal hormone replacement therapy is not adequate to protect young women with premature ovarian failure from developing osteoporosis. Women with premature ovarian failure have abnormally low levels of androgens circulating in their blood. This may contribute to the increase risk for osteoporosis. This study will compare two treatment plans for women with premature ovarian failure. Treatment plan one will be physiological estrogen hormone replacement. Treatment plan two will be physiological estrogen hormone replacement plus androgen. The study will attempt to determine which plan is more beneficial to women in relation to osteoporosis and heart disease. The hormones will be contained in patches and given by placing the patches against the patient's skin. The patches were designed to deliver the same amount of hormone as would be normally produced by the ovary in young women. The success of the treatment will be measured by periodically checking the density of patient's bone in the leg (femoral neck bone) . Researchers will take an initial (baseline) measurement of bone density before beginning treatment and then once a year for 3 additional years during treatment. The study will also consider bone density of the spine bone turnover heart disease risk factors and psychological state.    ,NCT00001951
Healthy,Using a Narcotic to Enhance the Numbing Effect of the Local Anesthetic Lidocaine on Inflamed Molar Teeth," The effectiveness of local anesthetics is reduced if inflammation is present making it difficult to control pain during such procedures as root canals and wisdom teeth removal. This set of studies will assess the effectiveness of the opioid (synthetic narcotic) fentanyl in enhancing the local anesthetic lidocaine (delivered with epinephrine) when used on inflamed molar teeth. In the first study a topical anesthetic patch or a placebo will be placed on the gum tissues next to four or five lower posterior teeth. The patch will removed at either 5 10 or 15 minutes. An electronic test that sends a light electronic impulse into the tooth lip sensitivity testing (""Is your lip numb?"") and discomfort reports will be started immediately after removal of the patch and repeated every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. An oral surgeon will then remove the patient's wisdom teeth (tooth). In the second and third studies a topical anesthetic will be placed on the gum tissue. An electronic test that sends a light electronic impulse into the tooth lip sensitivity testing (""Is your lip numb?"") and discomfort reports will be started and done several times throughout the test. Then two small openings one on each side of the tooth will be drilled into the bony tissues surrounding the tooth. A narcotic drug fentanyl or a placebo drug will be delivered through these openings allowing placement of the drug next to the nerves that are difficult to numb. Lidocaine along with a small amount of epinephrine will be delivered. An oral surgeon will then remove the patient's wisdom teeth or tooth (study 2) or do a root canal (study 3). In the fourth study a topical anesthetic will be placed on the gum tissue. Then two small openings one on each side of the tooth will be drilled into the bony tissues surrounding the tooth. A narcotic drug fentanyl or a placebo drug will be delivered through these openings. Lidocaine along with a small amount of epinephrine will be delivered at one of three rates (15 patients for each rate). Blood pressure heart rate and breathing rate will be taken before the topical anesthetic patch is applied 2 minutes after and every 5 minutes for the next 45 minutes. Blood samples will be taken 6 times over the course of 60 minutes. When testing is complete an oral surgeon will remove the wisdom teeth (tooth). One month later blood samples will be taken using a different drug delivery method in order to compare results.    ",NCT00001952
Healthy,Influence of Genetics in Pain Sensitivity," The purpose of this study is to learn more about the role of genetics in pain sensitivity. Pain perception varies widely among individuals and information gained from this trial may lead to better methods of preventing and controlling pain. The study consists of two parts described below. All enrollees will participate in part 1; patients needing oral surgery for removal of third molars may also participate in part 2. Normal volunteers oral surgery patients and family members of both groups may be eligible for this study. Part 1 -Sensitivity testing for hot and cold. Participants will rate their pain response to hot and cold stimuli on a scale from ""no pain"" to the ""worst pain imaginable."" Heat sensitivity is measured using a small probe placed on the skin for a few seconds. The hottest temperature tested may cause pain for a few seconds but will not produce a burn. Response to cold is measured by placing the hand in cold water for up to 3 minutes and occasionally flexing the fist. Participants will rate their pain level every 15 seconds. In addition to the testing a blood sample will be drawn to examine for genes related to pain. Part 2 - Oral surgery. Patients will have their third molar removed under a local anesthetic (lidocaine) injected in the mouth and a sedative (Versed) given through a vein in the arm. A small tissue biopsy will be taken from the tissue over one of the third molars. Patients will stay in the clinic for up to 7 hours after surgery while the anesthetic wears off and will rate any pain they may have according to the rating scale used in Part 1 of the study. Pain medication (ketorolac or Toradol) will be given when needed and patients will complete pain questionnaires for 3 hours after the drug is given to rate its effectiveness. Patients will receive additional pain relievers if needed. A second biopsy on the side opposite the first will be taken under local anesthetic to measure changes in chemical signals produced in response to the surgery.    ",NCT00001956
Healthy,Electromyography to Diagnose Neuromuscular Disorders, This study will investigate problems with muscle weakness and control using electromyography-a test of nerve-muscle cell communication. Advanced techniques called single fiber electromyography and macro-electromyography which evaluate individual muscle fibers will be used. Besides aiding in diagnosis these tests provide information about disease progression that may be useful in guiding therapy. Adult patients with suspected neurological disorders of muscle control and weakness may be eligible for this study. Normal volunteers may also participate. For the electromyography procedure a special needle is inserted into a muscle. The patient will slightly tense the muscle and maintain the tension while electrical signals from the muscle fibers are being recorded. The electrical signals are played through a loudspeaker providing feedback to help the patient tense the muscle the appropriate amount. The test which is usually done for only one muscle takes 1 to 2 hours. If needed short breaks can be taken. If the patient cannot maintain tension in the muscle for the entire test period a nerve will be stimulated to activate the muscle. A thin needle is inserted near the nerve and a series of small electrical shocks are given to activate a nerve fiber. The electromyography needle is inserted into the muscle to measure the response as described above. A neurologist receiving specialized training in clinical neurophysiology will do the electromyography procedure under the direct supervision of an experienced neurologist.    ,NCT00004553
Healthy,The Effects of Dextroamphetamine on Brain Function, The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the drug dextroamphetamine on the brain function and mood of healthy volunteers. Monoaminergic drugs are substances that affect the nervous system; these drugs can raise hamper or have no effect on brain function when given to healthy individuals. Different responses to a drug may be the result of genetic variations. This study will examine the effects of the monoaminergic drug dextroamphetamine on thought and sensorimotor processes while participants perform a variety of tasks. Participants in this study will undergo a medical history physical examination blood tests and an electrocardiogram (EKG). Women of reproductive potential will undergo a pregnancy test. Participants will be given either dextroamphetamine or placebo (an inactive solution) on two occasions separated by at least 3 to 7 days. Participants will then perform neuropsychological tests that will measure attention problem solving memory and ability to complete simple motor tasks.    ,NCT00004556
Healthy,Effects of Miconazole on Blood Flow, This study will investigate the effect of the drug miconazole on blood vessel dilation. Miconazole stops production of EDHF a substance that causes arteries to dilate. EDHF is produced by the cells that line blood vessels. Normal volunteers between the ages of 21 to 60 may participate in this study. Candidates will be screened for eligibility with a medical history physical examination electrocardiogram and routine laboratory tests. Those enrolled will be injected with miconazole to study its effects on blood vessels. Study participants will take three aspirin tablets. After administration of a local anesthetic small tubes will be inserted through a needle into the artery and vein of the forearm. These will be used to measure blood pressure and to draw blood samples during the study. Forearm blood flow will be measured using pressure cuffs placed on the wrist and upper arm and a strain gauge (a rubber band device) placed around the forearm. When the cuffs are inflated blood will flow into the arm stretching the strain gauge and the flow measurement will be recorded. Small doses of four drugs-bradykinin sodium nitroprusside miconazole and LNMMA-will be given through the arterial catheter. Bradykinin stimulates the release of EDHF and can lower blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside causes blood vessels to dilate and is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Miconazole is commonly prescribed to treat various infections including vaginal yeast infections jock itch and athlete's foot. In much higher doses it is used to treat fungal infections that have spread to the lungs brain kidneys or bladder. LNMMA inhibits production of nitric oxide another substance produced by the lining cells of blood vessels. Blood flow will be measured throughout the study which will last approximately 3 hours.    ,NCT00004575
Healthy,Study of New Magnetic Resonance Imaging Methods of the Brain, The purpose of this investigation is to develop improved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and hardware for studying brain function. MRI is a diagnostic tool that provides information about brain chemistry and physiology. This study will evaluate new MRI methods for monitoring blood flow to regions of the brain in response to simple tasks. The MRI machine used in this study is more powerful than those in most hospitals permitting a higher visual resolution. Normal healthy volunteers over 18 years old may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and questionnaire and a neurological examination. Study participants will have a yearly MRI scan. For this procedure the subject lies on a stretcher that is moved into a donut-shaped machine with a strong magnetic field. A lightweight circular or rectangular coil a device that improves the quality of the images may be placed on the head. The scan time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours; most scans last between 45 and 90 minutes. During the scan the subject may perform simple tasks such as listening to tapes tapping a finger moving a hand watching a screen or smelling a fragrance. More complex tasks may require thinking about tones or pictures and responding to them by pressing buttons. Information from this study will be used to develop better imaging methods that will in turn permit a greater understanding of normal and abnormal brain behaviors.    ,NCT00004577
Healthy,Comparison of Immune Response in Normal Volunteers and Patients With Helminth Infections, This study will compare the structure chemical composition and other characteristics of skin and blood in people with and without parasitic infections. Cell samples will be taken from blisters produced by suction blistering. This study may provide new information about the interactions between parasites and the immune system that could lead to better treatments for these infections. Normal volunteers and patients with acute helminth (a type of parasite) infections aged 18 years older may be eligible for this study. Following a medical history and physical exam participants will undergo suction blistering to provide cells needed for study. A suction blister device is attached to the skin of the thigh. A heating element in the device heats the skin to speed blister formation. (This will feel only a slightly warm.) The device is removed after about two hours when the blisters have formed. The blister tops are removed with sterile scissors. The blistered areas are then treated with special dressings to promote healing and the participant is discharged with further wound care instructions. A small amount of blood (around four tablespoons) may be drawn to compare chemicals in the blood with chemicals in the blister fluid. Participants will be contacted by telephone over the next 72 hours to check on healing. Further follow-up will occur by phone at 6 months and 1 year. Up to 60 blisters may be produced over a one-year period (in three separate sessions every six months) with no more than 20 raised per session.    ,NCT00004996
Healthy,Genetic Component of Handedness," Some functions are generally controlled by the right side of the brain and others by the left. One of the most easily observed examples of this ""lateral specialization"" of the brain is handedness-that is a person's preference for using either the right or the left hand. This study will try to determine how the genetic component of handedness is inherited. It will test the theory that a single gene is involved in determining handedness and will try to locate the gene. Families with at least two left-handed siblings aged eight years or older and at least one right-handed parent are eligible to participate in this study. The left-handed siblings and both parents will fill out a brief questionnaire on hand usage obtain a tissue sample taken from inside the cheek and return the questionnaire and the sample by mail to the study researchers. The tissue sample will be used for DNA gene mapping. Participants will be given a kit and instructions for obtaining the sample along with mailing envelopes. Cheek swab sampling basically involves using a small brush to gently brush a layer of cells off of the inner wall of the cheek and then dropping the brush tip into a preservative. The information gained from this study may provide insight into aspects of brain development that can be of medical benefit in the future.    ",NCT00005003
Healthy,Effects of Topical SLPI on Skin Wounds, This study will evaluate the effects of a protein called secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) on skin wound healing. Produced naturally by the body SLPI modifies levels of elastase a substance that breaks down the skin. Older people are at greater risk of impaired wound healing with increased elastase activity and inflammation. In addition men heal more slowly than women. Delayed healing is associated with infection and pain and can lead to the development of chronic non-healing skin wounds. Healthy men and women between 60 and 80 years old who wish to participate in this study will have a brief history and physical evaluation to determine their eligibility. Those enrolled will be randomly assigned to receive a gel form of SLPI applied topically (on the skin surface) to a skin wound or a placebo (a look-alike gel with no active ingredient). Participants will undergo the following procedures: First visit - The skin will be numbed with a local anesthetic and two small (4 mm) wounds (about the size of a pencil eraser) made in each upper arm. The drug or placebo will be applied to the wound and gauze placed over it. Two blood samples (20 ml and 7 ml) will be drawn an hour apart to determine blood levels of SLPI. Second visit - The day after the first visit the wound dressing will be removed and the participant will be evaluated for pain at the wound site allergic reactions or infection. A blood sample (7 ml) will be taken. Third visit - The wounds will be examined and photographed to evaluate healing. In addition the strength of the wound may be assessed by means of a vacuum system placed on the skin. (This may cause a tingling sensation over the wound.) A piece of all four wounds will be removed after the skin has been numbed and a dressing applied. Fourth visit - The wounds will be examined for healing and the dressing removed.    ,NCT00005569
Healthy,Safety and Anti-HIV Activity of Capravirine Alone and in Combination With Other Anti-HIV Drugs, This 2-part study will test the safety and anti-HIV activity of capravirine alone and the safety anti-HIV activity and drug interactions of capravirine combined with other anti-HIV drugs. Capravirine belongs to a class of drugs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) which are effective when used together with other drugs including nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and protease inhibitors. Normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may enroll in Part 1 of the study. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older who have not previously been treated with a NNRTI (efavirenz nevirapine and delavirdine) may participate in Part 2. All prospective study participants will be screened for eligibility with a physical examination blood tests a urine test and an electrocardiogram (ECG). Part 1 - Volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups as follows: Group 1 will receive capravirine alone for 7 days and capravirine plus efavirenz (another NNRTI) for an additional 10 days. On day 1 participants will have a physical examination urine test and laboratory blood tests. Blood samples will be collected just before the first dose of capravirine is given and again at 0.5 1 2 4 6 8 and 12 hours after the dose. A small plastic tube will be placed in a vein to avoid multiple needle sticks. On day 8 participants will have another physical examination and laboratory blood tests. Blood samples will be drawn again as described above. In the evening of day 8 efavirenz will be added to the regimen. On day 18 (the last day of the study) participants will have another physical examination and blood tests. Blood will again be collected as described above. Group 2 will take capravirine alone for 8) days and capravirine plus ritonavir (a protease inhibitor) for an additional 8 days. Physical examinations urine tests and blood collections will be done as described above on day 1 day 8 and day 16 (the last day) of the study. Part 2 - Patients will take capravirine alone for 7 days. On day 1 patients will have a physical examination urine test and laboratory blood tests. Blood samples will be collected just before the first dose of capravirine is given and again at 0.5 1 2 4 6 8 and 12 hours after the dose. A small plastic tube will be placed in a vein to avoid multiple needle sticks. On day 8 patients will have another physical examination and laboratory blood tests. Blood samples will be drawn again as described above. Additional drugs will then be added to the regimen (in varying doses according to group) as follows: Group 1 - efavirenz plus abacavir Group 2 - ritonavir plus efavirenz plus abacavir Group 3 - ritonavir plus efavirenz plus abacavir On day 15 the procedures performed on day 8 will be repeated. Patients will have the option of having blood drawn daily on days 2 through 7 to measure HIV-1 viral load and of having a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) done between days 2 and 7 to measure how well capravirine gets into the central nervous system. After day 15 patients in all groups will continue with their drug regimen until week 48 or until it is determined that the treatment is not effective for the patient. Physical examinations viral load measurements white blood cell counts and other blood tests will be done periodically throughout the trial. Within 4 weeks after the end of the study patients will be followed with another physical examination blood and urine tests and an ECG.    ,NCT00005673
Healthy,Investigation of the Effect of Acupuncture Needling on Connective Tissue Using Ultrasound Elastography," During acupuncture treatment acupuncture needles are inserted and manipulated until a characteristic local tissue reaction termed ""de qi"" is observed. De qi can be perceived by the acupuncturist in the form of ""needle grasp"" a mechanical gripping of the needle by the tissue. De qi is considered essential to the therapeutic effect of acupuncture. Therefore the investigator proposes that understanding this local tissue reaction will lead to an understanding of how the therapeutic effect of acupuncture therapy arises. Specifically it is hypothesized that needle manipulation causes winding of collagen and elastic fibers around the needle. This action induces tension in the collagen network surrounding the needling site and results in a mechanical signal that is transduced into local cells. The objective of the current work is to use ultrasound elastography a recently developed ultrasound imaging technique to visualize and quantify changes in the elastic properties of skin and subcutaneous tissue in 12 healthy human volunteers as a result of acupuncture needle manipulation.

Healthy,The Effect of Estrogen and Progesterone Levels on Knee and Ankle Joint Laxity, The proposed research is an observational study designed to compare estrogen and progesterone serum levels with knee and ankle joint laxity and muscle reaction time as a measure of neuromuscular function. Three groups of women athletes with differing estrogen and progesterone profiles (normal menstrual cycles amenorrheic and exogenous estrogen supplementation) and one control group (male collegiate athletes) will be used to compare differences in joint laxity and neuromuscular function. Blood levels of estrogen and progesterone will be measured at four time points across the menstrual cycle. Joint laxity and muscle reaction time will also be measured at each of these points. The investigator hypothesizes that knee and ankle joint laxity and muscle reaction time will significantly increase with increasing estrogen and progesterone levels.    ,NCT00005923
Healthy,Etanercept (Enbrel) to Treat Pain and Swelling After Third Molar Extraction, This study will evaluate the effects of the anti-inflammatory drug etanercept (Enbrel) on relieving pain and swelling after oral surgery. The Food and Drug Administration has approved Enbrel for treating symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis including pain. Healthy volunteers 16 to 35 years of age who require third molar (wisdom teeth) extractions may be eligible for this study. Participants must not be allergic to aspirin or to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Candidates will be screened for eligibility with a medical history and oral examination including X-rays if needed. Participation in the study requires four clinic visits: two for surgery and two for follow-up: Visit 1: Patients will have ultrasound pictures taken to measure cheek size. One hour before surgery they will receive a dose of either 25 milligrams (mg) of Enbrel; 15 mg of the standard pain medicine Toradol; or a placebo (salt-water) through an arm vein. A local injection of an anesthetic (lidocaine) will be given before surgery to numb the mouth and a sedative (Versed) will be infused through a vein to induce sleepiness. When the anesthetic takes effect a small piece of tissue will be removed from the inside of the cheek and then the upper and lower molars on one side of the mouth will be extracted. After surgery a small piece of tubing will be placed in the lower extraction site from which samples will be collected to measure chemicals involved in pain and inflammation. Patients will stay in the clinic for 4 hours after surgery while the anesthetic wears off and will complete pain questionnaires during that time. If an hour after surgery patients have pain that is not relieved by the treatment given before surgery they may receive acetaminophen (Tylenol) and codeine for pain. Another biopsy will be taken (under local anesthetic) from the inside of the cheek when pain occurs or at the end of the 4-hour observation period. The tubing then will be removed and the patient discharged with Tylenol and codeine for pain. Visit 2: Patients will return to the clinic in the morning 48 hours after the oral surgery for a 1- to 2-hour visit. They will fill out questionnaires undergo ultrasound imaging of both cheeks and have another biopsy taken from the inside of the cheek on the operated side. Visits 3 and 4: Three weeks after the first surgery patients will schedule extraction of the two wisdom teeth on the other side of the mouth and the procedures for visits 1 and 2 will be repeated.    ,NCT00006070
Healthy,Genetic Studies of Tone Deafness, This study will examine the hereditary basis of tone deafness by identifying regions of the human genome linked to this condition. Both exceptionally good pitch recognition (perfect pitch) and exceptionally poor pitch recognition (tone deafness) run in families. A better understanding of what causes tone deafness may provide new insights into auditory (hearing) function. Individuals with two or more family members 15 years of age or older who are tone deaf or have trouble recognizing different melodies may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a short listening test for pitch and a short written test. Those identified with poor pitch recognition will fill out a brief questionnaire about their family tree and family members (without identifying names) who have trouble recognizing melodies or tones. Individuals with poor pitch recognition will be asked to help contact family members who may be interested in participating. Members of families with two or more first-degree relatives (parents grandparents siblings) who are tone deaf may enroll in the study. They will provide a blood sample (about 2 tablespoons) for genetic studies and may take a 20-minute hearing test using headphones.    ,NCT00006076
Healthy,Feasibility Study for Development of an Early Test for Ovarian Failure, This purpose of this study is to gain information about normal ovarian function that will be useful in developing a test for early detection of ovarian failure. The ovaries produce female hormones such as estrogen that are important in maintaining a woman's health. When the ovaries do not work properly problems can develop. Unfortunately there is no test that can detect ovarian failure early in its course. By the time premature ovarian failure is diagnosed in young women two-thirds have already developed osteopenia (loss of some bone mass) and nearly one in ten have osteoporosis a greater loss of bone mineral density that weakens bones and increases the risk of fractures. Women with normal ovarian function ages 18 to 55 and postmenopausal women 60 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination blood tests and vaginal ultrasound examination. For the ultrasound study a probe that emits sound waves is inserted into the vagina and the sound waves are converted to form images of the ovaries. The procedure is done with an empty bladder and takes about 10 minutes. After this screening visit (Visit 1) those enrolled in the study will return to the NIH Clinical Center for the following additional procedures: Visit 2-Will be scheduled between days 3 and 5 of the menstrual cycle (for women who are still menstruating). Participants will have blood tests to measure hormone levels and to check for pregnancy and will have another transvaginal ultrasound examination. They will then receive an injection of a synthetic form of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) a hormone the body makes normally. Visits 3 and 4-Will be scheduled 24 and 36 hours after the FSH injection given during Visit 2 for collection of blood samples. Visit 5-Will be scheduled 48 hours after the FSH injection for additional blood sampling and a final transvaginal ultrasound examination.    ,NCT00006156
Healthy,Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Evaluating Kidney Function, Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is a potentially curable disease affecting 0.5-5 percent of patients with hypertension. The current diagnostic work-up of RVH involves a complex algorithm which includes doppler ultrasound captopril renography and conventional angiography. Because of the expense risk and inconvenience of this workup patients may not be correctly diagnosed. Advances in MR technology present the opportunity to develop a single comprehensive test. This would combine an MR angiogram that provides anatomic information about the renal arteries and an MR renogram that provides information about the functional impact of a stenosis as a cause of hypertension. Our main purpose is to test MR renography with and without an oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) combined with MR angiography against the reference standard of captopril radionuclide renography. Secondary goals of this study are to test whether hypoxia within ischemic kidneys affected by RVH is detectable by T2 weighted (Blood oxygen level dependent or BOLD) MRI. This is considered of value since such a test of oxygenation would further shorten and simplify the diagnostic MR test. Information gained from this study could lead to important changes in the diagnostic and pathophysiologic understanding of RVH.    ,NCT00006173
Healthy,Cyclooxygenase Levels Following Surgery to Remove Third Molars (Wisdom Teeth), This study will measure levels of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase in gum tissue following third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction. Cyclooxygenase is thought to contribute to pain that normally follows tissue injury or surgery. Healthy volunteers between 16 and 35 years of age who require removal of their third molars may be eligible for this study. Participants will receive an injection of a local anesthetic (lidocaine) in the mouth and a sedative (midazolam) through an arm vein before surgery. Before the tooth is removed a small tissue sample (biopsy) will be collected from the gum tissue covering one of the lower third molars to be extracted. After surgery a second biopsy will be taken at some point between just after surgery to the time when pain from the extraction starts to develop. These tissue samples will be analyzed for cyclooxygenase levels. Patients will stay in the clinic for up to 4 hours after surgery while the anesthetic wears off. During this time they will complete pain questionnaires. If needed patients may receive additional medicine for pain relief at any time during the surgery or the 4-hour observation period. They will also be given standard pain medication to take home at the end of the study.    ,NCT00006175
Healthy,Child & Adolescent Bipolar Disorder Brain Imaging and Treatment Study," This research protocol seeks to learn more about bipolar disorder in children and adolescents ages 6-17. Researchers will describe the moods and behaviors of children with bipolar disorder and use specialized testing and brain imaging to learn about specific brain changes associated with the disorder. This protocol studies children who have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and those who have a sibling or parent with bipolar disorder and are thus considered ""at risk"" for developing the disorder.

Healthy,Effect of Levetiracetam on Brain Excitability, This study will examine the effect of the newly developed anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam on excitability of the cortex (surface layer) of the brain. Levetiracetam works differently from other anti-seizure drugs but its mechanism is not well understood. This study may provide insight into a new protection mechanism against seizures as well as the effect of the drug on cortical excitability. Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a medical history taken and undergo physical and neurological examinations. Participants will undergo two different procedures in four separate sessions. One procedure (cortical excitability) involves taking either levetiracetam or placebo (a look-alike inactive substance) and having transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The other procedure (pinch-training related changes) involves taking levetiracetam or placebo doing a motor exercise called pinch training and having transcranial magnetic stimulation. For TMS a very brief electrical current is passed through an insulated coil wire placed on the scalp. The magnetic pulse travels through the scalp and skull causing small electrical currents in the cortex that may cause muscle hand or arm twitching or it may affect movements or reflexes. During the study subjects may be asked to make movements do simple tasks or tense muscles. Electrical activity of the muscles will be recorded using electrodes taped to the skin over the muscle. For the pinch training the subject makes a brief brisk pinch after each beat of a metronome every two seconds and then completely relaxes the hand until the next beat. Subjects will be tested on four different days at least 72 hours apart. Each session will last about 3 to 4 hours. Approximate schedule for cortical excitability testing: TMS (study 1) Take levetiracetam or placebo TMS (study 2) < 60 minutes after drug or placebo TMS (study 3) < 120 minutes after drug or placebo Approximate schedule for pinch-training related changes: Take levetiracetam or placebo TMS and pinch power measurement < 60 minutes after drug or placebo Pinch training for 30 minutes TMS and pinch power measurement Sample schedule: Session 1 < LTC and cortical excitability testing Session 2 < Placebo and cortical excitability testing Session 3 < LTC and pinch-training related changes Session 4 < Placebo and pinch-training related changes    ,NCT00006191
Healthy,Use of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to Study Visual Attention, The purpose of this study is to learn more about how the brain allows people to focus on important objects and filter out unimportant ones when looking at visual images. Our senses provide us with a vast amount of information at any given moment in time. For example visual scenes contain many different objects that cannot be processed simultaneously because of the limited processing capacity of the brain's visual system. Evidence suggests that a a network of brain regions selects relevant information and filters out irrelevant information when people view cluttered visual scenes. This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine how the different brain regions involved in attentional control and filtering interact. Participants in this study will undergo computer tests an MRI scan and TMS. During the MRI participants will look at pictures and count objects appearing on a screen. During the TMS participants will perform a computer test. Participants' ability to pay attention will be tested with and without TMS. Participants may be asked to return for additional tests in the future....    ,NCT00006285
Healthy,Role of Prostaglandins in the Regulation of Brain Blood Flow, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the role of prostaglandins-a type of fatty acid with hormone-like actions-in the regulation of brain blood flow. The results will provide information on how to better use this technique to study brain function which in turn may lead to a better understanding of certain illnesses and more effective treatments. Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Participants will fill out a health questionnaire and undergo a history physical examination and MRI studies. MRI is a diagnostic tool that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the scanning the subject lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. An intercom system allows the subject to speak with the staff member performing the study at all times during the procedure. Four separate studies will be done-two carbon dioxide inhalation studies and two functional activation studies-as follows: Carbon dioxide inhalation (indomethacin): This study is done in two parts. In both parts an MRI brain scan is done. During the scan the subject inhales an air mixture containing 6% carbon dioxide through a facemask or mouthpiece. Blood pressure and heart rate are monitored during inhalation of the mixture. For the second part of the study indomethacin-a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-is injected through a catheter (thin flexible tube) in an arm vein. Indomethacin inhibits prostaglandin production. Total scan time averages between 45 and 90 minutes with a maximum of 2 hours. Carbon dioxide inhalation (rofecoxib and celecoxib): This study is identical to the one above except either rofecoxib or celecoxib is given instead of indomethacin. Both of these drugs are also non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit prostaglandin production. Unlike indomethacin rofecoxib and celecoxib are given orally instead of through a vein so to allow time for the drug to be absorbed the second scan is delayed for 2 hours. Functional activation (indomethacin): This study is done in two parts. In both parts a MRI brain scan is done. During the study the subject performs a simple motor task such as finger tapping. For the second part of the study indomethacin is injected through a catheter in an arm vein. Functional activation (rofecoxib and celecoxib): This study is identical to the indomethacin functional activation study except either rofecoxib or celecoxib is given instead of indomethacin. Because they are given orally instead of through a vein the second scan is delayed 2 hours to allow time for the drug to be absorbed.    ,NCT00006318
Healthy,Drug Interaction Study of Tegretol (Carbamazepine) and St. John's Wort in Normal Volunteers, St. John's Wort is a popular dietary supplement that many patients-including those with epilepsy or seizures-take in addition to their regular medicines to elevate mood or relieve stress. Preliminary research indicates that this supplement can speed the metabolism of the anti-seizure drug Tegretol causing reduced blood levels of the drug. Patients who take Tegretol to control their seizures may have more frequent seizures if the blood level of the drug drops too low. A recent study shows that this effect is not seen when Tegretol is taken for at least 3 weeks. The present study will examine whether there is a medically important drug interaction between St. John's wort and Tegretol when Tegretol is taken for 1 day. Normal healthy volunteers between 21 and 65 years old who are not taking medicines that can affect the metabolism of drugs in the liver and have not used St. John's wort for at least 30 days may be eligible for this 25-day study. Participants will take a 400-mg dose of Tegretol after fasting overnight. Blood samples will be drawn the next day during a 12-hour clinic stay at the following intervals: just before the Tegretol dose and at 1 2 4 6 8 10 24 34 48 and 72 hours after the dose. A catheter will be placed in the vein to prevent the need for multiple needle sticks until after the 10-hour sample. After completing the blood sampling participants will take 300 mg of St. John's wort 3 times a day with meals for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks another fasting dose of Tegretol will be given and the 72-hour blood study will be repeated. This study may provide information important for the care of patients with epilepsy who take both Tegretol and St. John's Wort.    ,NCT00006395
Healthy,Study of Brain Changes Shaped by Experience, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to explore how the brain changes (reorganizes itself) in response to learning and to brain lesions in healthy people and people with various physical disabilities. Normal volunteers and patients with disabilities including blindness limb amputation hemispherectomy (removal of a cerebral hemisphere) and stroke may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with medical and neurological examinations. Participants will have MRI scans while they lie still or perform certain movements as instructed. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the scan the subject lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member through an intercom system at all times during the procedure. All participants will first have a scan to show brain structure which will take about 30 minutes. A second scan will measure blood flow or biochemical concentration and will take from 1 to 2 1/2 hours. Depending on their disability patients will participate in one of the following tests:   -  Blindness-This will study the ability of blind people to process tactile information.   -  Stroke- This will study mechanisms underlying recovery of motor function after stroke. The patient will perform voluntary movements or remain still during the scan.   -  Amputation- This will study mechanisms underlying the ability of the brain to reorganize after amputation. The patient will move different parts of the body or remain still during the scan.   -  Hemispherectomy- This will study mechanisms underlying the ability of one side of the brain to control movements of both arms. The patient will make different kinds of movements during the scan. Normal volunteers will participate in one of the following tests:   -  Use-dependent plasticity- This will evaluate the effectiveness of amphetamine and placebo in demonstrating brain flexibility. The volunteer will take an amphetamine or placebo (inactive pill) before the scan and then perform a specific exercise using the thumb.   -  Motor fatigue- This will study the mechanisms that underlie fatigue which affect many patients with neurological conditions. The volunteer will contract muscles in the forearm and hand for several minutes until he or she feels fatigue.   -  Light deprivation- This will evaluate changes in the brain that occur after light deprivation. The volunteer will remain at rest in the scanner for up to 150 minutes.   -  Somatosensory stimulation-This will examine whether stimulation of the wrist can cause changes in hand representation in the part of the brain that controls movement. The volunteer will make hand movements at different times during the test. In addition mild electric shocks will be delivered to the wrist for up to 2 hours. Although the shock intensity is regulated to avoid pain there may be some discomfort.    ,NCT00006424
Healthy,Pathophysiology of Chronic Wounds, This study will compare blood from healthy volunteers and with wound fluid and tissue samples from patients with acute and chronic wounds enrolled in other NIH studies. Chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers pressure sores ischemic ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers affect more than 4 million Americans each year and cost about $9 billion to treat. The nature of these wounds is not well understood and treatments are not always successful for unknown reasons. Blood collected from healthy volunteers will be used to prepare a model for studying various processes involved in wound healing. Normal healthy volunteers 21 years of age and older who do not smoke and have no medical problems of the heart bones muscles stomach lungs blood or nervous system do not have problems going to the bathroom and have no infections may be eligible for this study. Participants will be interviewed briefly for information on their date of birth gender ethnic identity and medical history and will have a brief physical examination including a check of height and weight vital signs and heart and lung sounds. About 14 milliliters (2 tablespoons) of blood will be drawn from the arm.    ,NCT00006437
Healthy,Data Distribution Procedures for NHLBI Data Repository, The purpose of this protocol is to establish data distribution and oversight procedures for a new repository of data collected from participants in clinical trials and epidemiologic studies sponsored by the Institute. The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) seeks to establish a data repository as described above. The well-characterized population samples in such a repository represent will constitute a valuable scientific resource. In order to take full advantage of such a resource and maximize its research value the data must be made available under appropriate terms and conditions to the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner. Many of the data sets currently at the NHLBI or soon to come to the NHLBI are from research studies in which the informed consents do not clearly state that the data will be made available to researchers other than those involved in the original research. This protocol is intended to establish the conditions and processes by which NHLBI will provide data sets to investigators and to establish oversight procedures by NHLBI's Investigational Review Board.    ,NCT00006506
Healthy,Vaccinia Immune Globulin in Treating or Preventing Vaccinal Infection, The purpose of this study is to follow responses to treatment with vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) for safety and clinical benefit [during HIV vaccine research]. VIG is purified from human blood and used to treat serious infections of the vaccinia (smallpox vaccine) virus or similar viruses. It is the only treatment available for those viruses. The only available supply of VIG has developed a discoloration over time and therefore is considered an investigational new drug by the FDA. This study will allow it to be used for intramuscular injection in a controlled setting for people who may need it [during HIV vaccine research].    ,NCT00006630
Healthy,Structure and Function of the Human Tongue, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound to examine changes in tongue volume and blood circulation during tongue exercises that require the use of different tongue muscle movements and contractions. More information on the structure and function of the human tongue is needed to develop better treatments for people with certain diseases affecting speech and swallowing. Normal volunteers between 21 and 80 years old who live in the metropolitan Washington D.C. area may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a brief medical history and physical examination including suitability for MRI testing and a brief examination of tongue lip and jaw movements. Participants will undergo ultrasound and MRI studies. During both tests they will perform tongue exercises such as holding a soft round object on the tongue or exerting tongue pressure against the back of the throat or roof of the mouth. During the ultrasound the subject lies on a flattened dental chair. A small transducer is placed under the chin to take images of the tongue during the exercises. A thin rubber strip with air-filled pressure bulbs is attached to the roof of the mouth (with dental adhesive) to measure tongue pressure. For the MRI the subject lies on a table that slides inside a donut's machine containing a magnetic field. MRI coils-special padded sensors that improve image quality-are placed around the head and neck. A pressure cuff placed around the arm measures blood pressure. The subject wears earplugs to muffle loud thumping noises that occur during electrical switching of the magnetic fields. The subject is in constant visual contact with the researchers and MR technologist and may request to stop the study at any time. Participants may undergo another procedure called magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging to examine how the fluid (water) in the tongue tissue shifts during tongue maneuvers. This procedure is essentially the same as the first MRI study but two small round coils are placed in the mouth (one on each side) between the cheeks and the teeth.    ,NCT00007137
Healthy,Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Infants, The study proposes to evaluate cognitive development in infants four months or younger by functional MRI and event related potential recording. fMRI imaging will be obtained following an auditory stimulus inside the 4 tesla magnet at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research and will be correlated with ERP response to the same stimulus.    ,NCT00008814
Healthy,Effects of Kava on the Body's Elimination of Caffeine and Dextromethorphan, This study will examine how kava-a widely used herbal remedy-may affect the body's elimination of other medicines. Many people take kava to reduce anxiety or cause sedation. Since this product is considered a food supplement and not a drug it is not subject to the rigorous pre-market testing required for prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. As a result information has not been collected on possible interactions between kava and other medications. This study will look at how kava affects the elimination of caffeine-a compound commonly found in chocolate coffee tea and soft drinks-and dextromethorphan-an OTC cough suppressant. Normal healthy volunteers 21 years of age or older may be eligible for this 30-day study. Candidates will provide a medical history and undergo a physical examination and routine blood tests. Women of childbearing age will have a urine pregnancy test. Study participants will not drink alcoholic beverages or take any medications (except those given in the study) for 2 weeks prior to the study and throughout its duration. In addition they will abstain from caffeine grapefruit and grapefruit juice and charbroiled foods for at least 72 hours before and throughout each study day that urine is collected. On day 1 of the study study subjects will take one dose each of caffeine and dextromethorphan at 4:00 P.M.. They will empty their bladder before the dosing and then collect all their urine after the dosing for the rest of the day and including the next mornings first urine. They will bring the urine samples to the Clinical Center when the collection is complete. This procedure will be repeated 1 week later (study day 8). After the second urine collection is completed subjects will take 200 milligrams of kava 3 times a day for 21 days. On study day 29 (after 21 days of kava) subjects will repeat the dextromethorphan and caffeine dosing and urine collection described above while continuing to take kava. Subjects will have an electroencephalograph (EEG) done before starting kava and again at the end of kava (study day 30). For this procedure several electrodes (metal cups attached to wires) are secured to the scalp with a glue-like substance. A conductive gel fills the space between the electrode and the scalp to ensure good contact. The electrodes will remain in place for about 2 hours and then removed. The subject lies quietly on a bed during the EEG recording. Participation in the study will end with another physical examination and blood tests following the second EEG and urine collection.    ,NCT00009542
Healthy,HIV-1 Vaccine Test in Uninfected Adult Volunteers," This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and will examine whether it causes an immune response to HIV virus proteins. A vaccine is given to try to create resistance or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic material) of two HIV proteins called ""gag"" and ""pol."" Injected into a human the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will see if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or proteins that may be made from it. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will provide a medical history including information on sexual activity and drug use. They will have a physical examination blood tests urine test and chest X-ray. All candidates enrolled in the study must use a barrier method of contraception for sexual intercourse from the start of the study until 3 months after the last vaccination. Participants will be assigned to one of two treatment groups: one will receive the experimental vaccine; the other will receive a control substance (inactive salt solution). The first five people assigned to the vaccine group will receive the lowest study dose of the vaccine. If this dose is safe it will be increased three times for the next group of five and then eight times for the last group of five. Each group will have a total of seven people - five will receive the vaccine and two will get the salt solution. Before the first injection and possibly the second and third a catheter (thin plastic tube) will be placed into a vein so that treatment can be given quickly if there is a reaction to the vaccine. Participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector. For each injection the volunteer will   -  be observed for at least 1 hour after immunization   -  record temperature and symptoms including any effects at the injection site for 2 days and report them to the clinic staff   -  immediately report any side effects to a study physician or nurse. Volunteers will have physical examinations and laboratory tests at certain times while they receive the vaccine and for a period afterwards. These procedures will require about 14 clinic visits of about 1 to 2 hours each and up to 6 hours on vaccination days. Blood will be drawn at all visits. Some of the blood will be used for genetic tests and some will be stored for future tests of the immune system and the body's response to the study vaccine. The study will last about 12 months from the date of the first injection. After it is completed clinic staff may contact volunteers once or twice a year for at least 3 years to follow up.

Healthy,Effect of Ginkgo Biloba on Phenytoin Elimination," This study will examine how the herbal remedy ginkgo biloba may affect the body's elimination of other medicines. Many people take ginkgo biloba to improve memory mental alertness and overall feeling of well being. Since this product is considered a food supplement and not a drug it is not subject to the rigorous pre-market testing required for prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. As a result information has not been collected on possible interactions between ginkgo biloba and other medications. This study will look at how ginkgo biloba affects the elimination of phenytoin-a medication used to treat patients with seizures. Normal healthy volunteers 21 years of age or older may be eligible for this 40-day study. Candidates will provide a medical history and undergo a physical examination and routine blood tests. Women of childbearing age must use a reliable form of birth control other than oral contraceptives (""the pill""). For at least 2 weeks before the study and throughout its duration study participants may not have any of the following: 1) medications that can affect platelet function (e.g. aspirin Motrin Advil Nuprin ibuprofen etc.); 2) alcoholic beverages; 3) grapefruit and grapefruit juice; and 4) all medications except those given by study personnel. On day 1 of the study subjects take one 500-mg dose of phenytoin at 8:00 A.M.. On an empty stomach. (Subjects fast the night before taking the phenytoin and are allowed to eat breakfast 2 hours after the dose). Blood samples are drawn just before dosing and again at 0.5 1 1.5 2 4 6 8 10 12 24 32 48 72 and 96 hours after the dose. Blood drawn on this first study day is collected through a catheter (small plastic tube) placed in a vein to avoid multiple needlesticks. After the 12-hour sample is collected the subject goes home and then returns to the clinic for the remaining blood draws which are taken by direct needlestick. When the blood sampling is completed subjects begin ginkgo therapy. The NIH Clinical Center provides participants a supply of 60-mg capsules of ginkgo to take twice a day (at 8 A.M. and 8 P.M..) for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4 weeks subjects are given a second dose of phenytoin as described above and repeat the blood sampling procedure. Subjects continue taking ginkgo during this second phenytoin study.    ",NCT00011063
Healthy,Effect of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids on Cardiovascular and Motor Responses Under Stress, This research study is designed to find out if increasing the dietary intake of polyunsaturated fats improves concentration motor skills and cardiovascular responses under stress. These polyunsaturated fats may also change the chemicals in the brain that control these responses. Specifically these polyunsaturated fats may raise brain levels of neurotransmitters called dopamine and serotonin. Polyunsaturated fats are important for improving the function of both the brain and the heart. People cannot make these polyunsaturated fats and they can only be obtained from the oils that we eat. For three months subjects will take 8 capsules a day that contain either corn oils flavored with fish oils or fish oil that taste a little like corn oils. Subjects will not be told which oils we expect to work better. An initial evaluation will determine if subjects fit the criteria necessary to enter the study. A battery of tests will be conducted twice once before starting the capsules and again after three months of taking the capsules. These batteries of tests will include an MRI of the head paper and pencil tests to evaluate changes in mood and tests of concentration and motor skills and cardiovascular responses under stress. Two lumbar punctures will be performed to collect cerebrospinal fluid so that changes in neurotransmitters can be evaluated. Subjects will be on a no seafood diet to equalize their dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Subjects will be expected to complete all parts of this study.    ,NCT00014027
Healthy,Effects of Dietary Carbohydrate and Fat on Hormones," This study will try to determine if intake of dietary fats or carbohydrates influences the tendency to gain weight or accumulate body fat. It will examine how the hormones that regulate weight may change with a shift from a balanced diet to one that is low in fat or carbohydrate irrespective of caloric intake. Men and women between the ages of 18 and 40 years with a body mass index of 30 to 49 kg/m2 may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a history physical examination blood tests and questionnaires regarding activity prior diets and eating patterns. Participants will follow two separate diet regimens for 5 days each. The first will be a balanced diet and the second will be either a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet or a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet. The diets are not designed to produce weight loss. Participants will receive all their meals and snacks for the two diets from the National Institutes of Health and for the first 3 days of each diet will be seen as outpatients. For days 4 and 5 of each diet they will be admitted to the Clinical Center and will undergo the following procedures:   -  Blood tests - Blood samples will be collected every 30 minutes over a 24-hour period through an indwelling catheter in the arm. A total of about 15 tablespoons will be drawn for each of the two diets.   -  24-hour urine collection - One 24 hour urine collection will be done at home the day before admission to the Clinical Center and the other will be done during the hospital stay.   -  Urinalysis and pregnancy test - A small urine sample will be taken and women will provide an additional sample for a pregnancy test.   -  Body measurements - Height and weight will be measured using scales. Body fat will be measured by two methods: skin fold thickness measured with calipers in 5 separate places; and body circumference measurements in which body parts are measured with a tape measure.   -  Bod pod measurement - Proportions of fat and non-fat tissue in body weight are measured while the participant sits in a capsule-like device for 5 minutes.   -  Bioelectric impedance analysis - Proportions of body fat are measured based on conduction of a small electric current.   -  Total body water estimate -The proportion of body weight that is water is determined using a method that involves drinking a cup of a special kind of ""heavy"" water (deuterium) and then measuring the amount of heavy water in a urine sample taken after 4 hours.   -  Exercise - Participants will maintain their usual exercise routine as it was before beginning the study.

Healthy,Biological Specimen Collection for Laboratory Methods Development and Training Purposes, This study will collect biological samples-buccal cells blood sample skin sample-to be used in developing and testing laboratory methods for measuring and analyzing genes. Such methods can be used for research on identifying genetic factors that may affect a person's cancer risk. All individuals age 21 and older may participate in this study. Participants will provide one or more of the following samples:   -  Buccal (mouth) cells - obtained by swishing a small amount of mouthwash in the mouth or by swabbing or bushing the inside of the cheek with a swab or brush.   -  Blood - obtained by pricking the finger and collecting the drops or by blood drawing through a needle placed in an arm vein.   -  Skin - obtained by a punch biopsy on the inner upper arm. For this procedure the skin is anesthetized and a small piece of skin is removed with a sharp instrument similar to a cookie cutter. The wound is then covered and held together with a sterile bandage. A small scar approximately 1/8-inch long will be left. Most participants will be asked to provide only a buccal sample; blood and/or skin samples will be requested from a few participants. The blood and skin samples may be used to grow cell lines; that is to make them grow indefinitely for research uses.    ,NCT00025831
Healthy,Brain Function in Mentally Ill Adolescents, The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to examine the brain activity of adolescents with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or major depressive disorder (MDD) before and after treatment. Adults with PTSD or MDD exhibit abnormalities in the structure and function of certain parts of the brain. Although PTSD and MDD are psychiatric disorders that often emerge in childhood the relationship between these disorders and brain structures has not been thoroughly studied in adolescents with the disorders. This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the parts of the brain that are involved in PTSD and MDD in adolescents. Adolescents with PTSD and/or MDD will be enrolled along with healthy adolescents with or without a history of abuse. Healthy adults will also be enrolled. Participants will be screened with a physical examination; blood tests; and interviews about mood general degree of nervousness and behavior. Adolescents and their parents will be interviewed separately and together. Following the interviews participants will undergo psychological tests. Participants with PTSD and/or MDD will have two weekly sessions of talk therapy. Participants who continue to experience PTSD or MDD symptoms after the talk therapy may continue the talk therapy alone begin treatment with fluoxetine (Prozac ) alone or begin fluoxetine in addition to the talk therapy. Participants who take fluoxetine will have blood collected before treatment and 8 weeks after treatment has begun. If participants do not respond to the treatment the treatment will be stopped and the participants will be offered another treatment. Participants who respond to treatment will continue treatment at NIH until a referral to an outside physician is made. Depending on the experiment in which they are enrolled participants will undergo one or four MRI scans. Participants who will have four MRI scans will undergo the scans on separate days. During the MRI participants will complete tasks on a computer. Saliva samples will be collected before and after the scans. Participants with PTSD and/or MDD will collect their saliva one or two days before the MRI scan.    ,NCT00025857
Healthy,Temperature Response to a Head-Neck Cooling System, This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a specially designed head-neck cooling system for way lowering the body's central or core temperature and cooling the brain. Brain cooling has an effect on stopping seizure discharges in the brain as well as the seizures themselves. If this system works to cool the brain a similar study may be tried in patients with epilepsy. Normal volunteers 21 years of age and older who have no medical or neurological condition and do not use any medications may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with an interview. Women will have a pregnancy test. Those enrolled will be hospitalized twice for overnight stays with the admissions 2 to 3 days apart. Participants will have a medical history physical and neurological examinations electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (EKG). Then electrodes will be attached to their scalp forearm and calf to measure temperatures in those locations. Intestinal (core) temperature will be measured with a temperature-sensing pill which will be swallowed earlier) and a hand-held infrared thermometer will be used to measure temperatures from the ear canal face head arms legs and abdomen. Electrodes on the scalp will also measure changes in blood volume in the brain for a study of brain blood flow. Subjects will be seated in a comfortable chair and fitted with the cooling system a portable unit with a circulating coolant. Cooling will last 30 minutes for the first session and 60 minutes for the second. Participants will be monitored for at least 30 minutes after each session to track temperature changes and have a post-cooling EEG recording.    ,NCT00025987
Healthy,Determination of Variances in Exhaled Nitric Oxide Output in Normal Healthy Male Volunteers Consuming High and Low Nitrate/Nitrite Diets, This study will determine whether and how nitrites and nitrates in the diet affect the level of nitric oxide gas that is breathed out in air. Nitric oxide is involved in many bodily processes such as immune function nerve signal transmission inflammation and dilation of blood vessels and bronchial tubes (tubes that branch out from the trachea into the lungs). Healthy male volunteers age 18 years or older who have not smoked for at least 5 years may be eligible for this study. Candidates will undergo blood and urine tests breathing tests and an electrocardiogram. Participants will follow two special diets for 3 days each. One is a low-nitrate and nitrite diet and the other is a high-nitrate and nitrite diet. Both diets must be completed within a month's time. Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for two 3-night hospital stays during the two diet periods but may go out on passes at any time. While on the diets they may consume only food prepared by the NIH Nutrition Department; eating other foods will seriously affect the study results. Meals may be eaten at the NIH Clinical Center or packaged meals prepared by the Nutrition Department can be taken out. Participants may not engage in any heavy exercise during the diet periods as exercise affects nitric oxide levels. Blood samples of about 4 milliliters or 1 teaspoon each will be collected before starting each diet and at the end of each diet to measure blood levels of nitrate and nitrite. Additional blood samples totaling about 2 tablespoons will be collected for research. Each day participants will have a test to measure exhaled nitric oxide levels. This involves blowing air into a mouthpiece attached to a machine that measures levels of the gas in each breath.    ,NCT00027157
Healthy,Immune Responses to HIV in Blood Cells in HIV-Infected and HIV-Uninfected Volunteers, This study will explore the responses of the immune system to infection with HIV and other pathogens and the changes in these responses over time. Healthy normal volunteers and HIV-infected patients 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Prior to enrollment and yearly thereafter vital signs height and weight will be recorded. A medical history will be obtained if relevant to the laboratory research for which the sample will be used. A more extensive history and physical exam is not required but may be performed if deemed necessary by the VRC clinician. A complete blood count will be performed on the day of enrollment and yearly thereafter. Samples will be collected in the following manner: Blood will be drawn from a needle in an arm vein one or more times during the course of the study. From 20 to 150 cc (4 to 30 teaspoonfuls) of blood will be collected at a time. No more than 450 cc (less than 1 pint) of blood will be drawn during any 6-week period. Urine and saliva samples will be collected by the volunteer in private. Swab samples will be collected by a nurse or doctor using a cotton swab to brush inside the mouth. Samples may be used for the following tests:   -  Hepatitis and other viral screening-This may include screening for different types of viral liver infections such as hepatitis A B C D E or G; for cytomegalovirus (related to the herpes virus); and for varicella zoster virus (responsible for chicken pox in children and shingles in adults).   -  Genetic testing-DNA in blood cells may be examined for genetic mutations (physical or chemical changes) or deletions (missing pieces) that affect substances involved in the body's ability to mount an inflammatory immune response. Alterations in the genes for some of these substances have been shown to influence HIV infection.   -  HLA testing-HLA type is a genetic marker of the immune system. Determining HLA type is necessary in order to do certain research studies. Some HLA types have been associated with an increased risk of diseases like arthritis and other rheumatologic problems. HLA testing may be used to try to identify factors associated with the rate of progression of HIV disease or related conditions.   -  Other laboratory tests as clinically indicated or required for research needs. Some samples collected in this study may be stored for future research.They will be labeled without identifying information. Those with interesting or strongly positive immune responses may be asked to return to the VRC Clinic to provide samples of urine or oral secretions.    ,NCT00027482
Healthy,Comparison of Externally and Self-Initiated Movements, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate how the brain controls voluntary movements triggered by an external stimulus or self-initiated. Registered HCMS healthy normal volunteers may participate. They will complete a questionnaire and will have a medical history and brief physical examination. The study consists of two parts: 1) body movement training and 2) magnetic resonance imaging as follows: Part 1 - Body movement training Participants will train to do three different body movements involving the hands and feet. The movements will either be self-initiated or in response to a stimulus such as a visual or auditory trigger. Part 2 - Magnetic resonance imaging Participants will do one or more of the trained movements with or without a triggering stimulus during MRI scanning. MRI is a diagnostic procedure that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of brain structure and activity. For the procedure the subject lies on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner-a cylinder containing a strong magnet. Earplugs are worn to protect the ears from loud thumping noises that occur with electrical switching of radio frequency circuits. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 2 hours with most examinations lasting 1 to 1-1/2 hours. The subject can communicate with the staff person conducting the test at all times during the scan. A device compatible with magnetic resonance will be used to record the participant's body movements. The participant may be asked to push buttons of the device during the tasks.    ,NCT00028197
Healthy,Screening Herbs for Drug Interactions, The purpose of this study is to detect potential herb-drug interactions in volunteers.    ,NCT00029263
Healthy,Brain Control of Bimanual (Both Hands) Movements, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate how the brain controls bimanual movements (movements of both hands). Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Participants will have a medical history physical and neurological examinations and will complete a questionnaire before and after testing. The study consists of two parts: 1) finger movement training and 2) magnetic resonance imaging as follows: Part 1 - Finger movement training Participants will train to do three different finger movements using the index finger of both hands. The fingers will be taped to a device that measures their movement. The movements are:   -  Lifting and dropping the index fingers of each hand repetitively and in synchrony (starting and stopping at the same time). The amplitude of finger movements is the same for both hands.   -  Lifting and dropping the index fingers of each hand repetitively and in synchrony but with a different amplitude for each hand.   -  Lifting and dropping of the index finger of each hand repetitively but each with a different amplitude and not in synchrony. Part 2 - Magnetic resonance imaging Participants will perform the trained movements during MRI scanning. This diagnostic procedure uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of brain structure and activity. For MRI the subject lies on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner-a cylinder containing a strong magnet. Earplugs are worn to protect the ears from loud thumping noises that occur with electrical switching of radio frequency circuits. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 2 hours with most examinations lasting 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The subject can communicate with the staff person conducting the test at all times during the scan.    ,NCT00029302
Healthy,Brain Receptors in Sympathetic Nervous System Regulation, The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of brain receptors called alpha2-adrenoreceptors in regulating the sympathetic nervous system which maintains the supply of blood and fuel to the body's organs in times of stress fear anger or exercise. Alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors (alpha(2)-AR) play a role in a variety of physiological functions. There are three subtypes of alpha(2)-ARs and their differences are unknown. This study will examine the functional roles of these three subtypes by comparing the behavioral biochemical psychophysiological and autonomic function effects of the alpha(2)-AR drugs clonidine and yohimbine. Participants in this study will undergo a physical examination electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood urine and saliva tests. Women will have hormone tests to determine the time of their last period and the time of their next ovulation. Participants will undergo neuropsychological testing and other procedures.    ,NCT00029627
Healthy,Effect of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Free Will, This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate how the brain controls movement by sending messages to the spinal cord and muscles. Healthy normal volunteers 21 years of age or older may participate in this study. They must have no medical neurological or psychiatric illnesses nor have been taking medications that affect nervous system function. Participants will undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation. For this procedure an insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp or skin. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. If the coil is placed over a nerve or area of the brain that controls muscles it may cause a muscle twitch possibly strong enough to move the limb. In other cases the subject may have a feeling of movement or feel a tingling sensation in a limb. Stimulation over the muscles on the side of the head may cause some discomfort in that area or twitching of the jaw. During the stimulation the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The electrical activity of the muscles activated by the stimulation will be recorded using metal electrodes taped to the skin over the muscle. In most cases the study takes less than 3 hours.    ,NCT00029653
Healthy,Effects of Ginseng and Ginkgo on Drug Disposition in Man, This study will assess the effects of ginseng and ginkgo on 1) cognitive function 2) enzymes that process drugs and 3) enzymes that may help prevent cancer.    ,NCT00029692
Healthy,Brain Activity During Production of Movement, This study will use electroencephalography (EEG) to examine how the brain prepares for movement. It will look at 1) what changes occur in a person's brain just before voluntary movement 2) when the changes occur 3) how consistent the changes are and 4) how the changes vary from person to person. The information from this study will be applied to other studies such as exploring how brain changes that signal movement can be used to control prostheses in patients with spinal cord injuries or stroke. Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. People with neurologic or psychiatric disorders and people taking medicines that may affect brain signals (e.g. Valium) may not participate. Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center on two separate days for testing sessions of 2 to 3 hours each. At each session an EEG cap will be placed on the head to record brain signals and electrodes will be placed on the arms to record movement. Subjects will perform simple movements during the EEG recording such as flexing their arm of clenching their fist. Researchers will use the first recording to determine the pattern of how the brain prepares for movement. During the second recording they will try to predict the subjects' movements based on the patterns discerned in the first recording.    ,NCT00029939
Healthy,Transfer of Neural Energy Between Humans, The purpose of this study is to determine whether visual evoked potentials generated in one human brain by photostimulation can generate a correlated EEG signal in the brain of another human subject who is located at a distance and who is not visually stimulated.    ,NCT00029978
Healthy,Brain Control of Blinking, This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study how the brain controls movement of muscles in the face-in particular those involved in eye blinking. TMS is a procedure that activates areas of the brain with magnetic pulses that travel through the scalp and the skull. Healthy normal volunteers 21 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. They must be free of any serious medical illness have no neurological or psychiatric disorders or history of seizures and must not be taking any medications that can affect nervous system function. Participants will undergo TMS and the electrical activity in muscles activated by the stimulation will be recorded. For TMS an insulated wire coil is placed on the patient's scalp and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil. This creates a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small electrical currents in the outer part of the brain. If the coil is placed over a nerve that controls muscles there may be a twitch in the muscles sometimes large enough to move the face. In other cases there may be a feeling of movement or tingling sensation in the face. Stimulation over the muscles on the side of the head may cause some discomfort there or twitching of the jaw. During the stimulation subjects may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. Electrical activity of the muscles activated by the stimulation is recorded. This is done with both metal electrodes taped to the skin over the muscle and with fine needle electrodes inserted into the muscles around the eyes. The study usually takes less than 3 hours with frequent breaks. If more time is required the study will be broken into more than one session.    ,NCT00030199
Healthy,Imaging Study of Automatic Movements, This study uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore the brain activities involved in performing learned automatic movements. Automatic movements are performed without concentrating on the details of the movement. Healthy adult volunteers are eligible for this study. Candidates will have a medical history and brief physical examination and will fill out a questionnaire. Women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test. Pregnant women will not be enrolled. Participants will perform certain tasks involving movement of the right or left hand while undergoing MRI scanning. They will undergo scanning twice-before and after practicing the movement tasks. Before the second scan participants will practice the following tasks for 1 week:   -  Tapping task - subjects use their left index finger to tap a button at a certain frequency.   -  Sequential movement task - subjects perform sequential finger-tapping movements with their right hand in which they tap buttons with their fingers at a certain frequency in a 25-second period. There are two sequences of different lengths referred to as sequence-4 and sequence-12 based on the number of movements in each unit of the sequence.   -  Visual distraction task - 14-letter sequences consisting of the letters A G L and O will be presented and subjects will be asked to identify the number of times they see a target letter.   -  Dual tasks - after completing all the above tasks subjects perform the following dual tasks: Tapping and visual task Sequence-4 finger tap and visual task Sequence-12 finger tap and visual task Tapping and sequence-4 finger tap Tapping and sequence-12 finger tap When the participants can perform the dual tasks correctly 90 percent of the time the movements will be considered automatic and the subjects will undergo MRI scanning. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain. For the procedure the subject lies still on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder containing the magnet). Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by electrical switching of radio frequency circuits used in the scanning process. The scan will last about 1.5 hours.    ,NCT00031382
Healthy,Cell Lines From High-Risk Breast Tissue, Background:   -  Many risk factors for breast cancer have been identified including family history endocrine background changes in breast tissue cancer in one breast radiation exposure obesity and others. There is a spectrum of tissue changes seen in cancerous and pre-cancerous breast tissue.   -  A cell line is a collection of cells that are grown in the laboratory from an original tissue specimen. Cell lines developed from high-risk breast tissue allow researchers to perform metabolic and molecular studies of breast cells over time. Objective: To establish a repository (facility in which tissue samples can be preserved and stored for many years) of cell lines from high-risk breast tissue to allow researchers to learn more about changes in breast cells that may cause them to develop into breast cancer. Eligibility: Women between 20 and 80 years of age who:   -  Have an increased risk of breast cancer because they are members of a high-risk breast or ovarian cancer family.   -  Have had breast cancer in one or both breasts.   -  Have had radiation for lymphoma before the age of 30.   -  Have a mutation in a breast cancer susceptibility gene but whose family history is not known.   -  Are not at increased risk of breast cancer. Design:   -  A small piece of breast tissue will be obtained from about 10 women without an identified risk of breast cancer and up to 100 women at high risk of developing breast cancer.   -  Cell lines will be developed from each high-risk category.   -  The cell lines and tissues will be used to establish a repository of high-risk breast cell lines and breast tissues that can be used to study how the cells develop into breast cancer.    ,NCT00032201

Healthy,Adolescents' Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, The purpose of this study is to help improve our understanding of when and why adolescents decide to use alternative and complimentary medicines and to understand factors that lead to better communication between youth and their clinicians.    ,NCT00032656
Healthy,Effects of Stress Hormones on Emotion and Cognition, The purpose of this study is to examine how hormonal changes that occur during stressful situations affect thought and emotions. Results from this study may lead to treatments that can alleviate the psychological effects of trauma. Levels of cortisol and norepinephrine increase in response to stress; these hormones also influence thought processes. This study will give hydrocortisone and/or yohimbine (a stimulator of central norepinephrine) to healthy adults in order to model the stress response and to better understand the way people process information during traumatic events. This study comprises two experiments in which the stress response is pharmacologically modeled. Participants in the study will have two study visits. During Visit 1 participants will undergo a psychiatric assessment complete neuropsychological tasks and have their IQ measured. During Visit 2 participants will be given hydrocortisone and/or yohimbine. Blood will be collected before and during this. Participants will then perform two experiments. In one experiment participants will hear a story with emotional and non-emotional segments; in a second experiment participants will view both emotional and non-emotional stimuli.    ,NCT00032838
Healthy,Stem Cell Collection for Adult Volunteers, This study will examine the development of stem cells (very immature cells produced by the bone marrow) and their potential to change into cells of other organ types. These cells will be studied for their potential use in creating replacement tissue for diseases ranging from diabetes to Parkinson s. Healthy volunteers 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood tests. Participants will undergo a process called 'stem cell mobilization and apheresis' to collect bone marrow stem cells. For five days before the collection they will receive injections of a hormone called G-CSF which stimulates release of stem cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. On the fifth day of the injections stem cells will be collected through apheresis. For this procedure blood is collected through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in an arm vein and directed into a cell separator machine. There the white cells and stem cells are separated from the other blood components through a spinning process and collected in a bag inside the machine. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a catheter in the other arm.    ,NCT00033774
Healthy,Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Children and Adults Using Arterial Spin Tagging Techniques, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine how blood flow to the brain differs at different ages with the brain is at rest and during performance of tasks that involve language memory motor control and sight. The study will evaluate the usefulness of MRI in identifying language function and location and may provide information on how the brain develops over time to process brain functions such as language and memory. Healthy normal volunteers in three age groups-children 8-10 adolescents 13-16 and young adults 21-30-may be eligible for this study. Participants must be right-handed and be native English speakers. Candidates will be screened via a telephone interview and examination by a neurologist. Participants will undergo MRI scanning of the brain during rest or while performing a task designed to test a skill. The tasks may involve remembering numbers reading a word tapping fingers or looking at a flashing picture. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce pictures of the brain. For the procedure the subject lies still on a table that is moved into the scanner (a cylinder containing the magnet). Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by electrical switching of radio frequency circuits used in the scanning process. Adults may spend as long as 90 minutes in the scanner usually less than 45 minutes. For children the time is less than 75 minutes-usually 30 to 40 minutes. Participants may be asked to repeat the scans up to 5 times in different sessions to test different brain functions or confirm findings.    ,NCT00034073
Healthy,Pilot Study: Effects of G-CSF on T Cell Function, This study will evaluate changes in T cells-infection-fighting white blood cells of the immune system-in people given a drug called G-CSF before donating stem cells (immature bone marrow cells) for transplantation. Originally bone marrow cells were obtained using a needle inserted into the hipbone of the donor. However when it was discovered that immature bone marrow cells also circulate in the blood scientists began to develop techniques to collect quantities of these cells from the blood instead of the bone. G-CSF is a blood cell growth factor that pushes stem cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Stem cell donors are given this drug 5 to 6 days before donation to make more cells available in the circulating blood for collection. Stem cell transplantation requires careful regulation of immune cell function to allow the donated stem cells to grow in the transplant recipient to prevent the transplanted cells from damaging the recipient and to allow the recipient's new immune system to develop normally so it can fight infections. Studies comparing the outcome of patients transplanted with bone marrow cells with those transplanted with stem cells suggest that the G-CSF given to stem cell donors affects the function of T cells in transplant recipients. This study will collect white cells containing T cells before and after G-CSF administration to determine the effects of the drug on both T cells and stem cells. Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older who meet the health criteria for donating blood may participate in this study. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are not eligible. Participants will undergo the following procedures:   -  Blood sample collection (15 milliliters or 3 teaspoons) to measure blood cell counts   -  Electrocardiogram to assess heart function   -  Apheresis to donate white blood cells. Participants will undergo two apheresis procedures-once before receiving G-CSF and a second time immediately after finishing the 5-day course of the drug. For this procedure whole blood is removed using a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood is circulated through a cell separator machine where the white cells are removed and collected in a plastic bag. The rest of the blood including the red cells platelets and plasma are returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm. The procedure takes 2 to 3 hours during which time the donor lies quietly.    ,NCT00039650
Healthy,Nerve Stimulation to Modify a Spinal Reflex, This study will determine whether stimulating the nerves or the brain can modify the spinal reflex that controls the muscles that flex and extend the ankle. Training spinal nerve networks with sensory input may provide a way of re-establishing movements such as walking in patients with spinal injury. Healthy normal volunteers with no history of peripheral neuropathy or radiculopathy ankle contractures or tendon surgery may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo three stimulation procedures each in a different session to measure leg muscle reflexes. The procedures are:   -  Reflex testing - Metal electrodes are taped to the skin over the leg muscles. A small electrical pulse is delivered through the electrodes to stimulate two nerves to the muscles. This evokes a reflex between the ankle flexor and extensor muscles. The responses to several dozen stimuli are averaged.   -  Nerve stimulation - The nerve to the muscle that flexes the leg is electrically stimulated near the knee through electrodes taped to the skin. The strength of the stimulus is adjusted to produce little or no muscle movement. The stimulation is repeated every few seconds for 45 minutes.   -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation - An insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small electrical currents in the outer part of the brain. There may be twitching in the muscles of the arm or leg. During the stimulation the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions to help determine the best position for the coil over the part of the brain that controls the leg. The leg is then stimulated once every 10 seconds combined with nerve stimulation every 1 to 2 seconds.    ,NCT00039819
Healthy,MRI Language Studies in Young Children, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate language function in children-that is how language skills such as naming objects understanding spoken language and reading are organized in the brain. The study focuses on children between 4 and 7 years old. Children 8 to 12 years old and adults will be studied before the younger children to test study paradigms appropriate for pre-literate children. The results of this study will help evaluate the usefulness of MRI in identifying language function and location and may improve the treatment of children with seizures. Right-handed native English-speaking adults and children between 4 and 12 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a routine neurological examination. Children will also undergo neuropsychological testing (standard tests of language memory perception and attention) either at the screening visit or at a later time. Parents will fill out a form to identify children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders. These children will be excluded form the study. All participants will undergo MRI scanning of the brain while performing a task designed to test a language skill such as identifying a picture or listening to or reading a word. The MRI detects changes in blood properties in the areas of the brain that perform each task. Before the MRI children will be rehearsed for the tests and will have a session in the scanner to know what to expect and feel more at ease during the actual test. The time in the MRI machine is usually between 15 and 20 minutes but will be no more than 40 minutes for children 8 to 12 years old and not more than 20 minutes for younger children. Children may be requested to have up to five MRI sessions to test different brain functions or confirm findings.    ,NCT00039845
Healthy,Magnesium Effects in Apheresis, This study will determine whether magnesium replacement during apheresis can decrease side effects that donors commonly experience. Apheresis is a method of collecting large numbers of certain blood cells such as white cells stem cells or platelets. In this procedure whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein similar to donating blood. The blood is separated into its components by centrifugation (spinning) the required cells are extracted and the rest of the blood is returned to the body either through the same needle or through another needle in the other arm. When healthy people donate cells by apheresis a blood thinner called citrate is added to prevent the blood from clotting in the apheresis machine. Citrate works by reducing calcium in the blood. When the blood is returned to the donor citrate from the machine is also returned lowering the donor's calcium levels. As a result donors often feel tingling around the mouth hands and feet. Some of these symptoms can be prevented by giving calcium intravenously (through a vein) during the procedure. Even with the added calcium however some donors still have symptoms. Magnesium levels are also lowered by citrate but it is not known if this causes symptoms. This study will examine whether the decrease in magnesium levels also contributes to the side effects of apheresis and whether magnesium replacement can reduce these symptoms. Healthy apheresis donors 18 years of age or older who are enrolled in NIH protocols may participate in this study. Donors will undergo the apheresis procedures required by the NIH protocol they are enrolled in. Throughout the procedure they will receive an intravenous infusion of a salt solution that may or may not contain magnesium. Blood samples of 5 milliliters (1 teaspoon) each will be taken from the apheresis machine at the beginning and end of the procedure and at 30- to 60-minute intervals during the procedure. No more than 50 ml (3 tablespoons) will be taken during any single apheresis. The last sample will be drawn 60 minutes after completion of the apheresis. In addition donors will:   -  Provide a urine sample at the beginning and end of each apheresis procedure.   -  Donate an additional urine sample and an additional 5 ml blood sample the morning after apheresis   -  Describe any symptoms experienced during apheresis to the apheresis nurse    ,NCT00040235
Healthy,Comparison of Blood Levels of Two Formulations of the Selective Hormone Receptor Modulator CDB-2914, This study will compare blood levels of the drug CDB-2914 in healthy women receiving the compound in crystalline powder form with the blood levels of women receiving an identical dose of the drug in micronized form. Generally absorption of compounds made into a crystalline powder is less than that of micronized compounds in which the substance is processed into many similar-sized particles. CDB-2914 is a manmade hormone similar to the hormones cortisol and progesterone. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is evaluating the ability of this drug to treat reproductive conditions. Institute studies have shown that CDB-2914 can increase the time to produce a mature egg in the ovary and cause an early menstrual period CDB-2914 might be used to treat fibroids and endometriosis pain. As part of its evaluation for these purposes this study will determine if absorption of crystalline and micronized powder forms of CDB-2914 result in the same blood levels of the drug. Women between 18 and 50 years of age who are in good health may be eligible for this study. Premenopausal women must not be pregnant (as determined by a urine pregnancy test) or breastfeeding and must practice birth control during the study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests. Women who use an IUD for contraception are advised to also use a barrier contraceptive (diaphragm or condom) the week after taking CDB-2914. Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center inpatient service or the outpatient day hospital twice for pharmacokinetic studies (blood drawing to measure blood levels of CDB-2914 after a single dose of the drug). They will come to the Clinical Center at 7:00 a.m. and have a catheter (thin plastic tube) inserted into an arm vein for drawing blood for the first 24 hours of the study. Eight milliliters (about 2 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn 5 minutes and 1 minute before taking CDB-2914 (in either crystalline or micronized powder form) and then at the following times after taking the drug: 15 30 45 60 75 90 105 120 150 and 180 minutes (3 hours) and 4 6 8 10 12 24 48 72 96 120 hours (5 days). Participants will take all their meals in the day hospital or ward during the first 26 hours of sampling. Inpatients will leave the hospital after the 24-hour blood draw and return as an outpatient on days 2 through 5. At the 48-hour time point additional blood will be drawn to check blood counts and chemistries and for liver and kidney function tests.    ,NCT00041899
Healthy,Socio-economic Status and Age-related Disability in a Biracial Community, The overall goal of the proposed project is to examine the reasons for the higher levels of disability in older people of lower socio-economic status.    ,NCT00042133
Healthy,Psychopharmacology of Fear-Potentiated Startle in Humans, The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of the drug alprazolam (Xanax ) on anxiety. To understand the effect of anxiety-relieving drugs on fear and anxiety researchers often have participants anticipate unpleasant stimuli. Anticipating unpleasant stimuli increases or potentiates a simple reflex called the startle reflex. The so-called fear-potentiated startle reflex (FPS) effect may be blocked or reduced by anxiety-relieving drugs. Evidence suggests that the FPS can be mediated by two mechanisms that regulate the phasic- and sustained enhancement of startle. This study will elicit phasic and sustained FPS in participants by having them anticipate moderately painful stimuli that are administered predictably and unpredictably. The main goal of this study is to assess the affect of alprazolam on the phasic and sustained enhancement of startle. This study comprises two pilot experiments and a main study. Participants in the study will be screened with a psychiatric history physical examination electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood and urine tests. Participants will four testing sessions separated by 5 to 10 days. At each session participants will be given one of two doses of alprazolam diphenhydramine or placebo (an inactive pill). Questionnaires and other tests will be performed.    ,NCT00044096
Healthy,Dyadic Interactions in Depressed and Non-Depressed Mothers and Their Infants, This study will examine 1) differences among mothers behaviors and how these behaviors influence their infants reactions and 2) how mother-child interactions relate to children s temperament and cognitive (thought processing) abilities and other areas of development. Depressed and non-depressed English-speaking mothers between 20 and 45 years of age with an infant 4 months or younger may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a mailed survey regarding their moods and feelings. Participants will undergo the following procedures:   -  Psychiatric Interview: Subjects will participate in a 30-90 minute interview consisting of a series of standardized questions about the their behaviors and feelings. Participants whose interviews suggest a condition that may impact their mental health will be referred to the study clinician for follow-up to confirm or clarify the preliminary findings. Continued participation in the study will be determined following this.   -  Home Visit: A study investigator will visit the home for 1 hour to film the mother and baby during the mother s typical daily activities. This visit will take place when the baby is about 5 months old. At the end of the visit the mother will be given a variety of surveys to fill out at home and return at the next visit (see Lab Visit below). The survey questions deal with the mother s relationship with her partner support from people in her life typical behaviors of her infant and how often she feels certain emotions. A packet of surveys will also be left for the participant s partner to complete and mail back to the investigator. The partner may or may not be the child s biological father and may or may not choose to participate in the study.   -  Lab Visit: Within 1 week of the home visit the mother and child will come to the NICHD clinic for about 2 hours. During this time the mother will return the previous surveys and fill out another one regarding her current mood. She will then interact with her child who will be seated in front of her. The 20-minute session will be videotaped. (There will be breaks during the session.) The mother will be instructed about how she should act (happy or sad). She and her baby will then participate in a variety of filmed situations that will induce certain emotions in the baby such as happiness fear activity frustration and interest in order to learn how different children react to different situations. Participants will be contacted to continue the study when their babies are 12 months old and again when the children are 24 months old. The above procedures will be repeated and some new measures will be added for toddlers that involve activities investigating aspects of early language and social reasoning..    ,NCT00044174
Healthy,Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to Study Brain Signaling, This study uses positron emission tomography (PET) to examine brain function and signaling involving phospholipids and to see how signaling is related to blood flow. Much of the brain is composed of fatty molecules called phospholipids. These molecules are involved in the way brain cells signal each other to direct brain function. Brain disease may change phospholipids and disturb brain structure and signaling. Studies of brain phospholipid composition and metabolism may help clarify how the brain works in healthy people or stops working effectively in disease states. Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests. Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET scanning as follows: MRI MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For this procedure the subject lies on a table that is moved into a metal cylinder (the scanner) and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. Subjects may be asked to lie still for up to 30 minutes at a time. PET For the PET scan a catheter (thin plastic tube) is inserted into an artery in the subject's wrist or elbow crease to collect blood samples during the procedure and a second catheter is placed in a vein in the opposite arm to inject radioactive tracers. The subject lies on the scanner bed wearing a special facemask and goggles. The mask helps hold the head still during the scans and the goggles either block all light or administer bright flashing lights. Radioactive water is injected into the vein followed by a 1-minute PET scan to measure brain blood flow. This is repeated three more times. Then a radioactive fatty acid is injected into the vein followed by a 1-hour PET scan to measure brain phospholipid metabolism. This is repeated once. The images of blood flow and phospholipid metabolism in the different regions of the brain under the conditions of darkness and during visual stimulation provide information on how and where the brain responds to visual stimulation. The entire procedure takes about 3 hours.    ,NCT00044200
Healthy,HIV-1 Vaccine Test in Uninfected Adult Volunteers, This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and examine whether it induces an immune response to HIV. A vaccine is a substance given to try to create resistance or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic material) of four HIV proteins called gag pol Nef and Env. Injected into a human the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will see if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or any proteins made from it. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will provide a medical history including information on sexual behaviors and drug use. They will have a physical examination and blood and urine tests. Women will also have a pregnancy test. Women enrolled in the study must either be infertile (e.g. due to menopause or hysterectomy) or must agree either to abstain from heterosexual sex or to practice birth control for at least 21 days before beginning the study and throughout its duration. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a placebo (a control substance made up of an inactive salt solution) and will be divided into three groups based on their entry into the study. Of the first seven people enrolled (Group 1) five will receive a 2-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If the vaccine is safe at this dose then in Group 2 five people will receive a 4-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If this dose is safe then in Group 3 thirty people will receive an 8-mg dose of vaccine and six will receive placebo. All participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector 2000® (Registered Trademark). At the time of each injection participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after immunization. At home they will record their temperature and any symptoms they may experience including any effects at the injection site for at least 2 days or as long as the symptoms remain. If symptoms occur participants will report them immediately to the clinic staff and if necessary come to the clinic for an examination. Participants will have about 10 clinic visits during the study. Most visits will last about 2 hours; those on vaccination days will last about 4 hours. At each visit participants will be checked for health changes or problems and will be asked about medications they are taking. Blood will be drawn for immune system testing. Additional laboratory tests may be requested between visits. Participants will be tested several times for HIV will be questioned about their sexual behavior and drug use and about social effects they may have experienced from their participation in the study. Some of the blood drawn for this study will be used to test for HLA type-a genetic test of immune system markers. For research HLA testing is sometimes used to try to identify factors associated with the progression of HIV disease or related conditions.    ,NCT00045838
Healthy,Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to Study Imagination of Movement, This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the relationship between cognitive processing and motor control by determining whether a part of the brain called the premotor cortex is essential to imagining movement. TMS described below is a method of brain stimulation that can temporarily inhibit brain functions of the area underlying the stimulator. Healthy right-handed normal volunteers may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history neurological examination and test of finger dexterity. Participants will perform a sequential finger tapping movement in response to a series of numbers (stimuli) displayed on a computer monitor. After 10 stimuli they will be asked which finger they tapped last. They will then imagine the same finger tapping movement and will be asked which finger they tapped last in their imagination. During these exercises participants will undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation. For this procedure the subject is seated comfortably in a chair. A wire coil is placed on the scalp and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that passes into the brain. This generates a very small electrical current in the brain which briefly disrupts the function of the brain cells in the stimulated area. The stimulation may cause twitching in arm or leg muscles. During the stimulation the electrical activity of muscles is recorded with a computer or other recording device using electrodes attached to the skin with tape. Subjects will complete eight experimental blocks of testing. One block consists of 20 experimental trials with each trial lasting about 10 seconds. Five pairs of TMS stimuli are given per trial with pulses delivered in short bursts of one second each. After each block subjects draw a mark on a line on paper showing how much attention they are paying how much fatigue they are experiencing and how well they think they are executing the tasks. Each TMS session takes up to 3.5 hours. Before the TMS session participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for use in determining proper placement of the TMS coil. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. For this procedure the subject lies still in a narrow metal cylinder (the scanner) for about 30 minutes during the scan.    ,NCT00046215
Healthy,Phase I Trial of Smallpox Vaccine, This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine called Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) for use against the smallpox virus. It will also investigate how many injections of MVA are needed to produce immunity against vaccinia virus which is closely related to the smallpox virus. An effective smallpox vaccine exists but it can cause side effects that on rare occasions can be life-threatening. The FDA gave new license approval for Dryvax on 10/25/02 but has not been used in the general population since smallpox was eradicated worldwide. Both the MVA and Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) vaccines are made using the vaccinia virus however the MVA vaccine contains a more attenuated or weakened form of the virus. [http://www.fda.gov/cber/products/smalwye102502.htm] Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 30 years of age who have never been vaccinated with a smallpox vaccine may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests including an HIV test and a pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. MVA placebo and Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) will be administered by different methods. The MVA vaccine and placebo are injected into an arm muscle with a needle and syringe. The Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) vaccine is administered as it was for many years with a special forked needle that is poked lightly into the skin of the upper arm usually 15 times in a process called scarification. When the vaccine works a small pus-filled blister forms followed by a scab and then scarring at the site of the vaccination. The formation of the blister and scab is called a take indicating that the vaccine is effective and is evidence of the development of immunity. The development of a take suggests that an individual will be protected against smallpox for at least a few years. If scarification does not take it can either mean that the person already has immunity or that the vaccine did not work. Participants will be assigned to groups as well as product randomly. For instance the first study participant could be enrolled into group 3. The Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) dose is given as a challenge to see if the person has a take. A reduced take response or no take could suggest that MVA is able to produce an immune response. The dosing schedules vary from 12 to 24 weeks and volunteers are in the study a total of 24 to 36 weeks depending on the number of injections. Participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after each injection. They will come to the clinic a week after MVA or placebo injections and at least twice a week after Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) for about 21 days to have the injection site evaluated and photographed. At each visit participants will be asked about how they are feeling and if they are taking any medications. Blood and urine tests will be done on injection days and at follow up visits scheduled 1 and 4 weeks after each immunization as well as 12 weeks after the Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) challenge dose. Additional tests may be done between visits if medically necessary.    ,NCT00046397
Healthy,Influence of the MDR1 Genotype on Blood Levels of Indinavir and Saquinavir in Healthy Volunteers, This study will examine whether a particular type of gene (MDR1) in the body can affect blood levels of two protease inhibitors indinavir and saquinavir which are used to treat people with HIV. If blood levels of these drugs are too low or too high they may not work well or may cause side effects in patients. This study will determine how MDR1 genes might affect absorption of these medicines. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and blood and urine tests. The blood will be tested for:   -  Routine laboratory values for assessing general health   -  HIV   -  MDR1 gene type   -  Amount of P-glycoprotein (a protein made by the MDR1 gene) on T cells. Participants will have blood drawn three more times as follows:   -  After one dose of the sedative midazolam (Versed(Registered Trademark)): Participants will take an 8-milligram dose of midazolam syrup by mouth. Four hours later a single blood sample will be drawn through a needle in an arm vein. This part of the study will assess the efficiency of a certain enzyme involved in metabolizing (breaking down) indinavir and saquinavir.   -  After four doses of indinavir: About a week after taking the midazolam participants will take 800 mg of indinavir (two capsules) 3 times a day (every 8 hours) for 1 day. The following morning they will come to the clinic where a catheter (flexible plastic tube) will be placed in an arm vein for repeated blood draws. A blood sample will be drawn and a fourth and final dose of indinavir will be given. Seven blood samples of about a teaspoon each will then be collected through the catheter over an 8-hour period to measure blood levels of the drug.   -  After 10 doses of saquinavir: About a week after the last dose of indinavir participants will start taking 1200 mg (6 capsules) of saquinavir soft-gelatin capsules 3 times a day for 3 days. On the fourth day participants will come to the clinic. A catheter will be inserted into an arm vein and about 4 teaspoons of blood will be collected for routine laboratory tests and to measure saquinavir levels. A urine sample will also be collected for routine tests. Participants will then receive the tenth and final dose of saquinavir and eight blood samples of about a teaspoon each will be collected through the catheter over an 8-hour period.    ,NCT00050180
Healthy,Learning a Motor Task Through Observation, Motor training results in use dependent plasticity (UDP) thought to underlie recovery of motor function after brain injury. The purpose of this protocol is to determine (a) if movement observation results in encoding of a motor memory in the primary motor cortex and (b) if observation of motor training can enhance the effects of physical training in healthy volunteers. If so this may become an important tool in rehabilitative treatment for patients who are unable or partially able to train. We will test our hypotheses by means of focal single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a group of healthy volunteers. Our outcome measure will be the change in TMS-evoked movement direction as a function of training strategy. So far we found that this is the case in healthy volunteers (see data in analysis of the study). The purpose of this amendment is to determine if action observation can elicit the same effects in adult chronic ischemic stroke patients who have had originally significant motor weakness but recovered to the point of being able to perform the motor tasks possibly resulting in a useful rehabilitative strategy.    ,NCT00050869
Healthy,MRI Study of Musculoskeletal Function, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound images to study how muscles tendons and bones work together to cause motion. The procedure is one of several tools being developed to characterize normal and impaired musculoskeletal function with the goal of developing improved methods of diagnosis and treatment of movement disorders. Healthy normal volunteers must be age 5 to unlimited with or without joint impairment may be eligible for this study. Volunteers with joint impairment may not have serious injury to the joint being studied previous surgery on the joint being studied or extreme pain at the joint being studied. MRI uses a strong magnet and radio waves to create images of the inside of the body. The subject lies on a long narrow couch inside a metal cylinder (the scanner) for up to 3 hours while the scanner gathers data. Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by electrical switching of radiofrequency circuits used in the scanning process. A special pad or tube may be placed over or around the region being scanned to improve the quality of the data. The subject will be asked to repeatedly move a specific joint such as the knee for brief periods usually less than 5 minutes. The subject can communicate via intercom with the person performing the study at all times during the procedure and may request to stop the study at any time.    ,NCT00051857
Healthy,Brain Encoding for Memory, This two-part study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS (see below) to explore how the brain forms memories. People remember only some of the events they experience every day such as faces they perceive words they read speech they hear and interpret and so forth. The events remembered are those that have been saved or formed in the brain. Part 1 of this study involves testing materials for Part 2 the TMS experiment. Part 2 uses TMS to examine what parts of the brain are involved in forming memories. Information gained from this study may be used in developing methods of enhancing memory in both healthy people and in patients with memory impairments. Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 35 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates may be screened with a medical interview and physical examination and a brief test of short- and long-term visual and verbal memory. Eligible volunteers may participate in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study as follows: Part 1 - Preparation of Words and Picture Materials Participants look at several words or shapes that appear in random order on a computer screen and try to remember them as well as possible for a memory test that will be given 20 minutes later. Each image appears on the screen for 3/4 of a second with 1-1/4-second intervals between them. For the test words and shapes are again shown on the computer screen at the same timing and intervals. When the items appear the subject presses one of three buttons as quickly as possible determining if he or she has recognized the items with a high or low level of confidence. The entire procedure lasts up to 1 hour with breaks in between. The purpose of this experiment is to find appropriate words and pictures to use as stimuli in the TMS study described below. Part 2 - TMS Experiment For TMS the subject sits in a comfortable chair. An insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp and brief electrical currents are passed through the coil creating magnetic pulses that stimulate the brain. The pulses may cause a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and twitching in muscles of the arm or leg. Electrodes are taped to the skin over some muscles of the hands to record the electrical activity of the muscles. Pulses are delivered in trains or short bursts of impulses each lasting half a second. Participants receive 90 trains for a total of 900 pulses. TMS is applied during the first part of the memory study when the words and shapes are first presented on the computer screen but not during the second presentation for memory testing. The entire procedure takes up to 2 hours with breaks in between. Before the TMS session participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine where to place the coil for TMS. For MRI the subject lies still for up to 30 minutes at a time on a table that slides into the scanner a narrow metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Earplugs are worn to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur while the scanner takes pictures. Subjects can communicate with the MRI staff at all times and can ask to stop the procedure at any time.    ,NCT00051870
Healthy,Infant s Examination and Manipulation of Objects, This study will explore how babies become able to use their experience with objects to plan to manipulate them appropriately. For example an adult knows that picking up a grocery bag full of canned food requires different actions than are needed for lifting an empty bag. This study will examine when and how infants first begin to adapt their actions to manipulate specific objects that weigh different amounts. Participants will include normal healthy babies within 2 weeks of their first birthday. If the expected results are obtained from testing 9-month-old children will then be studied to identify a lower age boundary in task performance. If the expected results are not obtained at the 12-month test age older children will be recruited to participate. The study involves one 30-minute session with the baby and his or her mother or father. The parent will answer some questions about the family such as its size and ethnic make-up. The infant will then have small magnetic sensors taped to the underside of each arm and to the back. While sitting on the parent s lap the infant will be presented with plastic toys and his or her actions will be measured by the sensors as he or she reaches for and picks up the toys. The sensors will be connected to a computer that will track and record the motion of the infant s arms.    ,NCT00053469
Healthy,Phase I/II Trial of Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) Vaccine Against Smallpox, This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine called modified vaccinia virus ankara (MVA) and determine if it confers protection against the smallpox virus (variola). There is an existing vaccine called Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) which is effective against smallpox; however this vaccine can cause various side effects including some that on rare occasions can be life-threatening. Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) has not been used in the United States since childhood vaccination was stopped in 1971 and though it is given to certain healthcare and laboratory workers and some people in the armed forces it is not recommended for the general population. Both the MVA and Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) vaccines are made using the vaccinia virus which is closely related to variola. Healthy normal volunteers between 31 and 60 years of age who have been vaccinated with a smallpox vaccine more than 10 years before entering the study may be eligible for this protocol. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests including an HIV test and a pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. Participants will receive MVA vaccine or placebo followed by a dose of Dryvax® (Registered Trademark). The MVA vaccine and placebo are injected into an arm muscle with a needle and syringe. The Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) vaccine is administered with a special forked needle that is poked lightly into the skin of the upper arm usually 15 times in a process called scarification. When the vaccine works a small pus-filled blister forms followed by a scab and then scarring at the site of the vaccination. The formation of the blister and scab is called a take indicating that the vaccine is effective and will protect against smallpox for at least a few years. If scarification does not take it can either mean that the person already has immunity or that the vaccine did not work. Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following dosing groups: 1) one injection of MVA; 2) one injection of placebo; 3) two injections of MVA 4 weeks apart; or 4) two injections of placebo 4 weeks apart. All participants will receive a challenge dose of Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) 12 weeks after their last injection of MVA or placebo to determine if the MVA vaccine has conferred immunity. A take that occurs in response to the Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) dose indicates lack of prior immunity and thus tells whether one or two doses of MVA is needed to produce an immune response. Participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after each injection. They will come to the clinic at least once a week after MVA or placebo injections and at least twice a week after Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) to have the injection site evaluated and photographed. At each visit participants will be asked how they are feeling and what medications if any they are taking. Blood and urine tests will be done according to the following schedule:   -  Before each injection;   -  1 week after each injection;   -  4 weeks after the MVA or placebo injections are finished;   -  At the time of the Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) dose;   -  4 weeks after the Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) dose;   -  12 weeks after the Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) dose. Additional laboratory tests may be done between visits if medically necessary.    ,NCT00053742
Healthy,Study of Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone in Normal Volunteers and in Patients With Thyroid or Pituitary Abnormalities, This study will determine the safety and activity of a new formulation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) a drug used for diagnosing and evaluating patients with certain thyroid gland abnormalities. Normal thyroid gland function depends on proper chemical signaling between the thyroid gland the hypothalamus (the part of the brain where TRH is made) and the pituitary (another part of the brain). The TRH test helps assess this interaction. Production of the only FDA-approved preparation of TRH was stopped in July 2002. As a result to have a continuous source of TRH available for NIH clinical and research purposes the NIH Clinical Center (CC) Pharmacy Department produced a pharmaceutical grade formulation of TRH for patient use. This study will test the CC formulation in healthy volunteers to show that its activity and side effects are similar to those of the previously available commercial test preparation. It will then be studied in CC patients for whom the diagnostic test is recommended. Healthy volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age and all patients requiring TRH evaluation of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid gland interaction may be eligible for this study. Patients include those with pituitary reserve inconsistent thyroid function test inappropriate TSH secretion or pre- and post-operative evaluation of pituitary tumors. Normal volunteers will be screened with a medical history physical examination and blood tests. Women of child-bearing potential will be given a pregnancy test; pregnant and breast-feeding women may not participate. The TRH test procedure will be the same for healthy volunteers and patients. All participants fast from midnight before the morning of the test. In the morning a catheter (flexible plastic tube) is inserted into an arm vein for easy injection of the TRH and collection of blood samples. Blood pressure is monitored before and during the test. A blood sample is drawn and then TRH is given through the catheter over a 1-minute period. Another nine blood samples are collected over a 3-hour period from the time of the TRH injection for measuring levels of various hormones. A total of less than 4 tablespoons of blood is taken for the test.    ,NCT00054756
Healthy,Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs on Brain Excitability, This study will evaluate the usefulness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in measuring cortical excitability. The cortex is the outer part of the brain. Patients with seizures have increased cortical excitability and are often treated with antiepileptic drugs to reduce this excitability. The therapeutic effects of antiepileptic drugs are usually tracked with blood tests that measure their blood levels. However these blood tests may not always correctly reflect the effects of the drugs on the brain. TMS has been used successfully to measure cortical excitability in many neurological diseases including epilepsy and may be helpful in measuring drug effects on the brain directly. For this procedure a wire coil is held over the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. This may cause a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and twitching in muscles of the face arm or leg. During the stimulation the participant may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history physical and neurological examination electroencephalogram (EEG) and blood tests. On the first day of the study participants will have a baseline TMS and will be randomly assigned to take one of two antiepileptic drugs: group A will take the carbamazepine; group B will take lamotrigine. If they wish participants may be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for the first 5 days of drug administration while the proper dosage is being determined. They will then be discharged and continue taking the drug for a total of 36 days. During this time they will have daily blood tests and TMS from days 2 through 5 and again on days 12 and 36. Group A will have additional blood sampling and TMS on days 37 39 44 and 53; Group B will have blood tests and TMS on days 38 40 45 and 53.    ,NCT00054990
Healthy,Effect of Hydrocortisone on the Brain, The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to examine the effect of the hormone hydrocortisone on the brain's response to various facial expressions. Glucocorticoids can influence emotional behavior and cognition; when given long-term the hormones may lead to mania or depression. One way glucocorticoids may influence emotional behavior is by affecting the activity of certain parts of the brain that participate in emotional processing. Brain imaging studies indicate that the amygdala ventral medial prefrontal and other prefrontal cortical areas of the brain are activated during tasks that require processing of emotional stimuli. These brain structures contain dense concentrations of glucocorticoid receptors. This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the brain activity of participants as they view faces that express different emotions. Participants will perform this task under a dose of either the glucocorticoid hydrocortisone or placebo (an inactive solution). Participants in this study will be screened with a medical history physical examination blood tests and an interview about their mood degree of nervousness and behavior. On Visit 1 participants will undergo screening and neuropsychological testing. For 3 days prior to Visit 2 participants will collect their saliva. During Visit 2 participants will undergo MRI scans of the brain after infusion with either a high or low dose of hydrocortisone or placebo. Participants will also undergo functional MRI (fMRI). Blood samples will be collected every 15 minutes during the scan. Following the MRI participants will take attention and memory tests.    ,NCT00055003
Healthy,Brain Use of Sensory Information to Generate Movement, This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate functions of brain regions that may use information from sensory organs such as the eyes or ears to generate movements. For TMS a wire coil is held over the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. This may cause a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and twitching in muscles of the face arm or leg. During the stimulation the participant may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Individuals with a history of neuropsychiatric disorders brain lesions such as tumors stroke or trauma or a history of significant medical disorders such as cancer may not participate. Candidates will be screened with a medical history brief physical examination and questionnaire. Participants will be presented a sequence of shapes (circles rectangles and triangle) and will count the number of a specified shape. Each number is assigned to a corresponding response button. The subject will push the appropriate button with the corresponding finger. During these experiments the scalp will be stimulated by TMS. Each set of TMS measurements will take up to 3-1/2 hours.    ,NCT00055289
Healthy,Nervous System Function in Normal Volunteers During Cycling Training, This study will identify changes that occur in the nervous system of healthy normal volunteers while they are learning a cycling task. Healthy subjects 18 years of age and older who can cycle for 16 minutes may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a brief medical history and physical examination. Participants will be assigned to one of three groups:   -  Complex training: Cycling for 16 minutes at a constant speed of 60 rpm with frequent changes in pedal resistance.   -  Simple training: Cycling for 16 minutes at a constant speed of 60 rpm with no changes in pedal resistance.   -  No training: Remaining seated on the bike for 16 minutes performing no exercise. Participants will cycle for 16 minutes for the training task plus 4 minutes before and after the training. Reflexes will be measured with nerve conduction studies and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) recordings before and after training. Nerve conduction studies measure the speed with which nerves conduct electrical impulses and the strength of the connection between the nerve and the muscle. For these studies a probe is placed on the skin over the calf muscles and the knee to deliver a small electrical stimulus and wires are taped to the skin to record the impulses. SSEP recordings which measure of the excitability of the brain to sensory stimuli are collected from electrodes placed on the scalp. After the training period multiple train stimulation (MTS) is applied for 10 minutes. For MTS weak electrical currents are delivered for 10 seconds every 10 seconds. These stimuli produce a buzzing sensation without pain discomfort or muscle twitching. The MTS is followed by another 4 minutes of cycling. Participants also undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For this procedure an insulated wire coil is held over the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small electrical currents in the brain cortex (outer part of the brain). The stimulation may cause twitching in the muscles of the face arm or leg. The electrical activity of the muscles is recorded with a computer or other recording device using electrodes attached to the skin with tape.    ,NCT00055588
Healthy,Development of Techniques for Use in MRI With a Magnetic Field of 7 Tesla, This study will develop new techniques for optimizing resolution in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a high magnetic field of 7 Tesla. MRI is a diagnostic tool that generates high-quality images of the body without the use of x-rays. It can also provide information about brain chemistry and physiology. The test is routinely done at magnetic field strengths of from 1.5 to 4 Tesla. This study will use an investigational device that operates at a high magnetic field of 7 Tesla. Except for the increase in magnetic field all other aspects of imaging are the same as those at lower magnetic fields. This study will use techniques in conjunction with the higher magnetic field that may improve diagnostic imaging. The MRI will monitor the brain at high resolution to see structural features to measure brain chemicals and to determine how much and how fast blood flows into brain regions in response to simple tasks. Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may participate in this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history neurological examination and questionnaire. Participants will have a standard 1.5 or 3 Tesla MRI before the 7 Tesla scan adding about 5 minutes to the procedure. The procedure for both scans is the same. The subject lies on a table that is moved into the scanner. Because the machine makes loud sounds during the imaging earplugs are provided to help reduce the noise. An insulated wire coil may be placed around the subject's head to obtain better images. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours with most examinations lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. During the scan the subject may be asked to perform simple tasks such as listening to tones tapping fingers moving a hand watching a movie on a screen or smelling pleasant odors. More complex tasks may require thinking about tones or pictures and responding to them by pressing buttons. Following the test subjects will complete a brief questionnaire about comfort level and any unusual sensations they may have experienced during the test. Participants who undergo repeated MRIs for the evaluation of new techniques will have a standard 1.5 or 3 Tesla MRI brain study once a year while participating in the research protocol. A radiologist at NIH will read the MRIs and if any abnormalities are discovered the individual will be referred to his or her private physician or to a consult service at NIH.    ,NCT00056914
Healthy,Effect of Talampanel (an AMPA Receptor Blocker) on Brain Activity, This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to test the safety of an experimental anti-epileptic drug called Talampanel and learn how it affects brain activity. Talampanel blocks a type of brain receptor called AMPA; inhibiting this receptor may result in anti-seizure activity. TMS stimulates the outer part of the brain called the cortex. For this procedure an insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. This may cause a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and muscle twitching in the face arm or leg. EEG records the electrical activity of the brain in the form of brain waves. For this procedure electrodes (metal discs with a conductive gel) attached to wires are affixed to the scalp with a paste and the brain activity is recorded. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age may participate in this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical and neurological examination electrocardiogram (EKG) blood tests and blood pressure measurement. Women who are pregnant or nursing are excluded from the study. Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center for three testing sessions at least 1 week apart and a final follow-up visit. The procedure for each test session is as follows: 7 AM - Blood pressure is measured EKG and EEC leads are placed a heparin lock is inserted and a blood sample is drawn. The heparin lock is a thin needle enclosed in a thin plastic tube. The needle guides the tube into a vein and is then removed leaving the tube in place. The indwelling tube allows multiple blood samples to be drawn without repeated needle sticks. 8 - 9 AM - TMS followed by EEG recording. 9 AM - Administration of Talampanel or placebo (pill with no active ingredient) by mouth. 10 AM - Blood sample #2. 10 AM -11 AM - TMS followed by EEG recording every 5 minutes. 11 AM - Blood sample #3. 12 PM - Blood sample #4. 11 AM - 1 PM - EEG recording every 5 minutes/ 4 PM - Blood sample #5. 5 PM - Discharge from Clinical Center. At the final follow-up visit the participant will talk with the doctor and have one final blood draw.    ,NCT00057460
Healthy,Brain Imaging of Serotonin Transporters in the Brain, Serotonin is a chemical involved in the regulation of emotions anxiety sleep stress and other body functions. The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to study how serotonin works in the brain. The serotonin transporter (SERT) regulates the release of sertonin throughout the body. Until recently radioactive chemicals called tracers were not suitable for viewing SERT activity. However a newly developed tracer called [11C]DASB can be used with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to view the parts of the brain that use serotonin. Participants in this study will be screened with medical and psychiatric examinations an electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood and urine tests. This study comprises two parts. During Part 1 participants will undergo a whole-body PET scan. During Part 2 participants will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. At the next study visit participants will have one or two PET head scans. If not is not possible to perform both scans on the same day an additional visit will be scheduled for the second PET scan.    ,NCT00059046
Healthy,MRI Study of Self-Perception of Postural Stability, This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine loss of balance in the elderly. Falls due to balance problems are a major health issue in older people often resulting in bone fractures and other bodily injuries and in functional decline. Risk factors for falling in the elderly include some standing positions in which older people usually experience balance problems such as leaning forwards or backwards. Functional MRI records brain function while the subject performs a task such as moving a limb or speaking and detects changes in the brain regions involved in those tasks. This study will look at different brain areas to see which areas might control what people see around them while they are standing. Healthy normal volunteers between 20 and 90 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be in good health have no difficulties in performing activities of daily living and be able to walk for at least 400 meters (1/4 mile). They will be screened with a medical history and physical examination. Participants will undergo functional MRI while performing visual recognition tasks in two experiments described below. For the MRI procedure the subject lies in the MRI scanner a narrow metal cylinder containing a strong magnet for 20 minutes to 3 hours with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. The experiments are as follows: Experiment 1 During MRI scanning the subject watches computer-generated movies of a person leaning forwards and backwards. When the subject recognizes an unstable body position in the movements he or she presses a computer mouse. Experiment 2 During MRI scanning the subject watches still pictures of people leaning in stable and unstable postures and presses a button as soon as he or she recognizes that the posture is unstable.    ,NCT00060593
Healthy,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Calculus Problem Solving, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify brain regions involved in solving algebraic math problems. It will examine brain activation according to the level of difficulty and the number of steps required to solve the problem. This information will help identify a possible correlation between problem-solving strategies and patterns of brain activation. Undergraduate or graduate students between 19 and 36 years of age who have completed at least 2 years of college have had at least one college course in integral calculus and who have no history of neurological disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history including psychiatric and neurological information. Participants will be asked to mentally solve a variety of integral calculus problems while undergoing MRI scanning a procedure that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of structural and chemical changes in the brain. During the scan the subject lies on a table in a narrow cylinder (the scanner) containing a magnetic field. A problem and possible solution are presented to the subject who presses a button to verify if the answer is correct. At the end of the test the participant completes a follow-up questionnaire to determine the problem-solving strategies used.    ,NCT00060658

It will identify differences in brain activity during task performance between people who have a nervous system illness and those who do not. MRI is a diagnostic tool that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of structural and chemical changes in the brain. Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 55 years of age who are right-handed and are native English speakers may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history including psychiatric and neurological information. Participants will be asked to perform social and emotional reasoning tasks such as sorting and judging rules and rule violations while undergoing MRI scanning. Some tasks may simply involve viewing items on a screen. Others may involve solving complex problems and responding by pressing buttons. During the scan the subject lies on a table in a narrow cylinder (the scanner) containing a magnetic field. The scan will last about 2 hours with subjects asked to lie still for up to 10 minutes at a time.    ,NCT00060853
Healthy,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain in Emotional Processing, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify brain regions involved in performing certain tasks especially those involving emotions. MRI is a diagnostic tool that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of structural and chemical changes in the brain. The study will also examine which MRI techniques are best to use when scanning brain areas involved in different emotions. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age who are right-handed and are native English speakers may be eligible for this study. Individuals with a history of neurological disease post-traumatic stress disorder or other psychiatric disorder or who have a history of physical or sexual abuse may not participate. Candidates will be screened with a written questionnaire and a medical history including psychiatric and neurological information. Participants will perform tasks involving emotions while undergoing MRI scanning. For this procedure the subject lies on a table in a narrow metal cylinder (the scanner) containing a magnetic field. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. The subject is asked to lie still for up to 10 minutes at a time. During the scan the subject performs simple tasks involving the viewing of pictures on a screen. Other tasks involve viewing pictures and responding to them by pressing buttons. Some pictures are violent or pornographic while others are pleasant to view. Of a total of 162 pictures 30 percent are categorized as graphic and possibly disturbing.    ,NCT00061204
Healthy,Investigating the Cognitive Processes That Underlie Social Knowledge and Behavior," The purpose of the protocol is to localize the neural regions and systems mediating the forms of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in the human prefrontal cortex. Utilizing a variety of experimental neuropsychological tasks during functional MRI we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in social cognition and emotional processing. We will ascertain the relationship between so-called cold cognition such as event knowledge and ""hot"" social cognition such as attitude formation and specific brain regions within the prefrontal cortex. We will also attempt to determine the relationship between non-frontal neural structures involved in emotional expressions such as amygdala and those frontal neural structures involved in executive functions that may modulate emotion. The data that we collect in this protocol will be of value in (1) identifying a set of neural regions and distributed networks mediating the forms of knowledge representation stored in the prefrontal cortex and (2) developing functional MRI screening measures for subjects at-risk for developing a neurological disorder. We will also use the data obtained in these studies with healthy adult volunteers to constrain theories of frontal lobe function based on the study of patients with focal or diffuse frontal lobe lesions and to provide convergent evidence for the role of specific frontal cortex sectors in specific cognitive functions.

Healthy,Stimulating Deep Brain Regions With a Magnetic Stimulator, The purpose of this study is to determine whether a special coil designed for magnetic stimulation of areas deep in the brain can affect mood and emotion in healthy volunteers. Researchers hope to better understand how the brain controls mood and motivation and what goes wrong with this process in disease. For transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) a wire coil is held over the scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the coil and creates a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Eighteen participants 9 men and 9 women will be enrolled in this study. They will be assigned to one or both of the following two experiments. Experiment 1 In this experiment researchers will test the effectiveness of a new type of wire coil. They will deliver magnetic impulses of varying strength. Approximately 150 stimulations will be given over of about 20 minutes. To determine whether the coil causes any problem with hearing participants will undergo a hearing test immediately before and after the experiment. Experiment 2 This experiment which has two parts is designed to determine whether TMS can affect mood. In the first part participants will be asked to report any changes in mood before during and after the magnetic stimulation. In the second part they will be asked to choose between sets of 2 identical pictures-choosing one will result in full magnetic stimulation choosing the other will result in stimulation at 10 percent of full intensity. Participants will be compensated up to $100 for their involvement in this study.    ,NCT00063245

Healthy,Increasing Physical Activity Levels in Low-Income Women, Regular physical activity is important for good health. Women particularly women with low incomes have many personal barriers to regular physical activity. The purpose of this study is to reduce environmental barriers to physical activity for women in two specific low-income neighborhoods (in Louisville KY) by providing opportunities for safe physical activity and addressing barriers such as lack of child care. Two groups of women will have pretest information (cholesterol blood sugar blood pressure percent body fat height weight waist and hip measurements) collected and the same information 6 months later at post-test. One group will have access to multiple physical activity opportunities in their neighborhood and at the neighborhood community center. An advanced registered nurse practitioner will facilitate the activity opportunities. The groups will be compared on their pretest and post-test information to see if the group with the physical activity opportunities has increased physical activity as measured by pedometer and self-report questionnaire and to see if there are changes in the measures tested at pre and post (measures that may be improved by regular physical activity).    ,NCT00065026
Healthy,Wise Mind: Environmental Approach for Obesity Prevention," The study will be conducted in four Catholic schools with children enrolled in Grades 2 through 6. Girls and boys and children of all racial types are eligible for participation in the study. We anticipate that approximately 1000 to 1200 children will volunteer for the study. We request enrollment of 1200 children. To participate parents must grant written consent and the child must assent by signing a consent form that is attached. Two of the four schools that volunteer for participation in the study and are approved by the research team will be randomly assigned to a health promotion program called ""Wise Mind for Diet and Physical Activity. The other two schools will be randomly assigned to a program called ""Wise Mind for Avoidance of Alcohol Drugs and Tobacco."" Students will receive the program in the school that they attend. They will not be allowed to select one of the programs and will receive only one program i.e. the program in their school. Both health promotion programs will last for two academic years. Each year every child that is a research participant will be tested on two occasions once during the first two months of school (Sept and Oct) and once during the last two months of school (March and April). Testing will not be conducted during May in order to avoid interference with school activities at the end of the academic year. All children (in all four schools) will have the same testing. The testing will involve confidential measurement of eating habits food intake physical activity habits attitudes about alcohol drugs and tobacco body weight and height body fatness body image mood and self-esteem. The measurement techniques that will be used for this measurement will include: questionnaires weighing measurement of height and photography of foods before and after eating. All measurements will be confidential and will not be released to anyone that is not involved in the management of the study including school personnel. The total time requirement for each testing period is expected to be approximately three hours spread over four testing periods during a two-week period. The testing periods will be conducted in conjunction with school administrators and will not be scheduled to conflict with important school activities classes or academic tests. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be organized to provide oversight for the conduct of the study.    ",NCT00065039
Healthy,Studying Use-Dependent Plasticity, Recent studies suggest that when patients learn a new motor movement it may cause a change in the way the nerves act in the area of the brain that controls that movement. This change is called use-dependent plasticity. The purpose of this study is to determine the direction and extent of the changes that take place in the brain areas that control movement in the untrained finger after the training of the opposite finger. The study outcomes may help researchers to develop rehabilitation strategies for people who have suffered brain injuries. Eighteen healthy adults age 18 years or older will be enrolled in this study. Participants will undergo a clinical exam and then come back to the Clinical Center three times for sessions that will last approximately 2 hours each. For each session participants' forearms will be immobilized and a small electronic device will be attached to each index finger so that researchers can measure their movements. Participants will be asked to move either index finger and to observe and concentrate on its movement. Investigators will perform transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after these motor exercises. For TMS a wire coil is held over the scalp and a brief electrical current passes through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that electrically stimulates the brain.    ,NCT00067223

Healthy,Pharmacokinetic Interactions With Prednisolone in Healthy Volunteers and HIV-infected Patients Receiving Single-Dose Prednisone, This study will evaluate the impact of the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics-that is the interaction of the medication and the body-of prednisolone after prednisone is given to healthy volunteers. Prednisone an agent known as a corticosteroid or steroid hormone is converted by the body into prednisolone. Ritonavir is an HIV medication that fights the virus by blocking its ability to reproduce. Sometimes it increases the blood levels of other drugs given at the same time and it is possible that ritonavir increases the blood levels of prednisolone and those of other medications. Results from the study will provide information on whether prednisone and ritonavir interact in a potentially harmful way. The MDR1 genotype that is part of a person's genetic constitution may influence how prednisolone behaves. Patients 18 to 50 years of age who are in good health who not have HIV and who do not smoke may be eligible for this study. There will be 10 participants and another 5 later who will be control subjects. Those in the control group will take only prednisone not ritonavir. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  Medical history and physical examination.   -  Collection of blood and urine to assess general health.   -  Collection of blood to examine markers on white blood cells and to determine the kind of MDR1 gene was inherited.   -  HIV test. The screening visit will take about 3 to 4 hours and the study will take about 28 to 49 days. For 3 study days participants will remain in the clinic for 12 hours On Study Day 1 patients will be asked to not eat or drink anything besides water before coming to the clinic. Blood samples will be collected to measure prednisolone concentration as well as osteocalcin a blood protein involved in bone formation. Blood tests will also allow a look at the surfaces of some white blood cells. Patients will receive a breakfast along with 20 mg of prednisone. Urine samples will be collected also. Then patients will be dismissed and asked to collect urine samples and return them on the following morning Study Day 2. At that time there will additional blood collection. Patients will begin taking ritonavir between 7 and 28 days after the first dose of prednisone at a dose of 200 mg (two 100 mg capsules) twice daily with food to continue for 15 days. On the 4th and 14th days of their taking ritonavir patients will be asked to visit the clinic in the morning for a blood to measure ritonavir in the blood and to take a single 20-mg dose of prednisone along with the ritonavir. Both medications will be taken with breakfast. Blood and urine levels of prednisolone will also be measured. On the 15th day of ritonavir dosing there will be another blood collection for routine lab tests as well as studies on blood cells and osteocalcin.    ,NCT00072644
Healthy,Improvement of Use Dependent Plasticity in Chronic Stroke Patients, This study will examine the role of an amphetamine in improving the effect that electrical nerve stimulation has over brain flexibility associated with motor training in patients who experienced a stroke more than 1 year before. Chronic stroke is the main cause of long-term disability among adults. Previous studies have shown that electrical stimulation given over the skin may improve patients' recovery of motor function. Furthermore it is known that amphetamines can improve the effects of sensory stimulation such as touch. Use dependent plasticity refers to a process in which the performance of simple repetitive finger movements leads to encoding the details of those actions in the primary motor cortex of the brain. Plasticity in this sense refers to the capacity for change in the brain. Patients 18 years of age and older who have had a stroke who have no history of other neurological and psychiatric illnesses and who are able to contrite and perform simple attentional tasks and other tasks may be eligible for this study. There will also be healthy participants as a control group. Participants will have an electrocardiogram. They will also go through a practice session of about 3 hours in which they become familiar with the different tasks required in the study: motor training pinch force and the Jebsen-Taylor Test-which requires doing as fast as possible actions that include writing lifting small common objects turning pages or lifting light or heavy objects. Then during the study patients will be involved in a variety of sessions:   -  Motor training alone for about 3 hours.   -  Motor training amphetamine (or placebo) and electrical stimulation for about 6 hours.   -  Motor training amphetamine and no electrical stimulation for about 6 hours. A magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) scan will be done. Patients will lie still on a table that can slide in and out of a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. Patients may be asked to lie still for up to 60 minutes at a time. As the scanner takes pictures there will be loud knocking noises and the patients will wear earplugs to muffle the sound. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan and may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. During another procedure called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) a wire coil will be held over the scalp. A brief electrical current will be passed through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Patients will hear a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be muscle twitches of the face arm or leg. Patients may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions so that the coil can be positioned appropriately. The stimulation is usually not painful although sometimes strong contractions of the scalp muscles can cause discomfort or a headache. Patients can ask to have the procedure discontinued at any time. For the electrical stimulation procedure three pairs of electrodes will be placed on the skin. A quite brief pulse of current will pass between the electrodes creating the electrical field that activates the brain. Patients will feel a brief stinging around the electrodes. Regarding the amphetamine patients will take it orally on up to four different occasions. Usually they will take 10 mg of Dexedrin before testing.    ,NCT00072735
Healthy,Spinal Cord Plasticity," This study will examine the role of the spinal cord in improving leg movements after physical training in healthy people. The results of this study may be helpful in developing new rehabilitation therapies for people with impaired leg function. Healthy volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a brief medical history and physical examination. Participants will undergo EMG-H reflex measurement while pedaling on a stationary bicycle. For this test the subject is given an electrical stimulation at the nerve at the back of the knee while pedaling on a stationary bicycle. The shock produces a jerky movement called the ""H reflex."" The muscular activity causing these reflexes is measured using electrodes (small metal disks) filled with a conductive gel and taped to the skin over the calf muscle. The nerve is stimulated at four different frequencies during the experiment. While cycling pedal resistance changes making it harder or easier to pedal. On study day 1 participants have EMG-H reflex measurement to determine baseline performance then a training session to prepare for the actual test and then a post-training test to measure performance again. The test is repeated on days 2 then between days 5 and 8 and again between days 11 and 14. The screening and first visit last 2 hours; the remaining test visits are 1 hour each. The bicycling time is only 15 minutes during training and 5 minutes at each test session.    ",NCT00073606
Healthy,The Effect of Ethanol on Brain Activity, This study is divided into two parts; each designed to answer a separate but related question: Which brain regions are activated in humans by the rewarding properties of ethanol administration? Is it possible to demonstrate a conditioned response to a stimulus paired with rising blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) in humans and can this response be observed in the brain using functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) techniques? Part 1. In order to determine which brain regions are activated by the rewarding properties of ethanol administration we propose to use Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI techniques to test the hypothesis that during the time of rising and peak BAC mesolimbic mesocortical and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) terminal areas of the brain will show significant increases in cerebral blood flow. Healthy non-alcoholic subjects will be given intravenous (IV) ethanol or placebo infusions on separate days. The infusions will have three phases. On each day during the first phase a saline infusion will be used to measure basal brain blood flow. The second phase will be an ethanol infusion delivered at rates calculated to produce a BAC of 0.08 plus or minus 0.005 g/dl at 10 minutes. The rate of the infusion for the next 10 minutes (third phase) will be calculated to maintain BAC at the target level of 0.08 plus or minus 0.005 g/dl for the duration of the infusion. On the placebo day subjects will receive a saline infusion at the same set of rates for phases two and three as used during their ethanol infusion. Continuous multi-slice fMRI data will be collected during each infusion. Part 2. In order to investigate conditioned response to ethanol three groups of healthy non-alcoholic subjects will be given a series of IV infusions on separate days. The experimental group will receive ethanol infusion paired with a conditioned stimulus (CS) which will be presented while the BAC is rising. One control group (I) of healthy non-alcoholic subjects will also be given a series of intravenous ethanol infusions on separate days but these infusions will not be paired with a CS. The other control group (II) will be given only saline infusions during the CS presentation. After three training sessions all three groups will undergo an fMRI scan during which the CS will be paired with saline infusion. This will allow the response to the CS alone to be observed. After 10 minutes of CS presentation the ethanol infusion will begin and continue for another 15 minutes. Conditioned response (CR) will be demonstrated if the experimental group shows greater increase in BOLD signal than the control groups in motivation areas such as mesolimbic mesocortical and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) terminal areas of the brain in response to the CS while they receive the saline infusion. Control group II will also undergo an fMRI scan and will be given saline infusion followed by ethanol infusion during their last 15 minutes in the scanner to control for the non-specific effects of repeated infusions & scans on BOLD response to ethanol. If we are able to produce a CR in brain regions associated with motivation it may be possible to use this CR as an experimental model for human alcohol craving.    ,NCT00074360
Healthy,PET Imaging of DHA Metabolism, This study will examine the use of positron emission tomography (PET) for measuring docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) absorption from the blood into the brain. DHA is a type of fatty acid found in fish and other seafood. It is involved in brain cell activity that underlies the ability to think move and respond to the outside world. When the amount of DHA in the brain is low the brain may not work the same as if there were a normal amount of DHA. If PET can be used successfully to evaluate brain DHA metabolism this method might be useful for future studies of alcoholism since brain DHA levels are influenced by alcohol consumption. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Because study participants must stop taking any medications including herbal preparations individuals who require regular medication are excluded from this protocol. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  Psychological questionnaires concerning thoughts and behaviors.   -  Nutritional status analysis: A dietitian will assess the subject's nutritional status through questionnaires and measurement of body fat. Body fat is measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. This analysis uses a low safe electric current to measure body composition giving a reading of the percentage of fat in the body.   -  Fat biopsy to measure the composition of fat tissue: An area on the upper half of the buttock will be numbed and a needle will be inserted to aspirate a sample of fat tissue for analysis.   -  Blood drawing: Blood samples will be collected at the time of the fat biopsy and the PET scan (see below) to measure DHA and indicators that may influence DHA.   -  Diet: 3 days before the fat biopsy and at least 3 days before the PET scan subjects will consume a diet low in DHA and other omega-3 fats. This no seafood diet prohibits eating fish shellfish seaweed seafood health food products or supplemental vitamins and foods containing canola or flaxseed oil. Caffeine-containing beverages are limited to one per day for 3 days before the study. Alcoholic beverages are prohibited for 2 weeks before the study. For 24 hours before the PET scan subjects eat only standard meals that will be provided to them.   -  Magnetic resonance imaging: A brain MRI scan will be done to fit the PET scan images onto a picture of the whole brain. During the scan the subject lies on a table inside a narrow metal cylinder containing a strong magnetic field.   -  PET scan: Before the PET scan catheters (small plastic tubes) are inserted into an arm vein and into a wrist artery. The venous catheter is used for injecting a radioactive substance that will be detected by the scanner and the arterial catheter is used for collecting blood samples during the scan. For the scan the subject lies on a bed that slides into the doughnut-shaped scanner. A mask is placed to keep the head still. A transmission scan is done to see how much radiation the skull absorbs. Radioactive water (15O-water) is then injected into the blood and the brain is scanned for about 10 minutes to measure brain blood flow. Then radioactive DHA (11C-DHA) is injected followed by about 1-1/2 hours of scanning to measure DHA absorption into the brain.    ,NCT00074503
Healthy,Rimonabant to Reduce Alcohol Consumption, This study will examine whether Rimonabant a drug that blocks cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptors in the brain affects alcohol consumption. Substances called endocannabinoids which have many of the same effects of marijuana bind to CB1 receptors. Animal studies show that when CB1 receptors are blocked the animals consume less alcohol. Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 40 years of age who consume between 20 and 40 alcoholic drinks per week drink at least 4 days a week and are not seeking treatment for alcoholism may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history including questions about alcohol and drug use physical examination blood and urine tests breath alcohol test and electrocardiogram. Participants are asked about their mental health history and use of alcohol cigarettes and illicit drugs and fill out questionnaires evaluating their emotional state and personality. Then they begin a baseline evaluation in which they call a number at the NIH Clinical Center for 21 days to report how much alcohol they drank that day. One week after starting the baseline evaluation they are randomly assigned to take either Rimonabant or placebo (a pill with no active ingredient) for 2 weeks. Before starting the drug they have a urine drug screen and measurement of blood alcohol level. After 1 week on the test medication they return to the Clinical Center to monitor drug or placebo side effects if any and to have a blood alcohol level test urine drug screen and blood tests for routine blood chemistries. After 2 weeks on the test medication they come to the Clinical Center at noon for an alcohol self-administration test. Before the test they are given a breath alcohol test and a urine drug test. The results of both tests must be negative to continue in the study. The alcohol self-administration test is videotaped. A heparin lock is placed in a vein in the participant's arm. This small needle remains in the arm for the duration of the study to avoid multiple needle sticks for blood draws. Blood is drawn periodically during the test to determine routine laboratory values cotinine level (assessment of smoking status) the amount of Rimonabant or placebo in the body and levels of various hormones. Thirty minutes before the test begins and every 30 minutes during the test participants complete questionnaires and rating scales regarding their mood and desire to drink. Five minutes before the test be...    ,NCT00075205
Healthy,AMD3100 to Mobilize Stem Cells for Donation, Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have become the preferred source of hematopoetic stem cells for allogeneic transplantation because of technical ease of collection and shorter time required for engraftment. Traditionally granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been used to procure the peripheral blood stem cell graft. Although regimens using G-CSF usually succeed in collecting adequate numbers of PBPC from healthy donors 5%-10% will mobilize stem cells poorly and may require multiple large volume apheresis or bone marrow harvesting. Although G-CSF is generally well tolerated in healthy donors it may be associated with bone pain headache myalgia and rarely life threatening side effects like stroke myocardial infarction and splenic rupture. AMD3100 is a bicyclam compound that inhibits the binding of stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) to its cognate receptor CXCR4. CXCR4 is present on CD34+ hematopoetic progenitor cells and its interaction with SDF-1 plays a pivotal role in the homing of CD34+ cells in the bone marrow. Inhibition of the CXCR4-SDF1 axis by AMD3100 releases CD34+ cells into the circulation which can then be collected easily by apheresis. Recently a published report demonstrated that large numbers of CD34+ cells were rapidly mobilized in healthy volunteers following a single subcutaneous injection of AMD3100. Remarkably the number of CD34+ cells collected by apheresis following a single injection of AMD3100 was comparable to the number of CD34+ cells collected from historical controls receiving 5 days of G-CSF prior to stem cell mobilization. Although the study population is relatively small side-effects to this agent have been mild and transient with no serious complications having been reported. The ability to collect a large quantity of PBPC with a single injection of this drug makes this an attractive agent for mobilizing donors of allogeneic PBPC. However the immunologic profiles of AMD3100 mobilized cells in terms of lymphocyte content (T cell B cell NK cell immuno-regulatory T cell) T cell polarization status (TH1 versus TH2) status of antigen presenting cells (DC1 versus DC2) alloreactive potential and preservation of reactivity to infectious agents (e.g. EBV CMV) are unknown. Consequently whether AMD3100 mobilized PBPC would be suitable for use as an allograft is uncertain. In this study we will collect PBPCs following a single subcutaneous injection of AMD3100 from healthy donors who have previously had PBPC collected using standard G-CSF mobilization. The AMD3100 mobilized cells G-CSF mobilized cells and circulating cells prior to both AMD3100 and G-CSF mobilization will be analyzed in terms of cellular content and function of lymphocytes NK cells and antigen presenting cells. AMD3100 mobilized PBPC will be collected for the purpose of research studies and will not be used for therapeutic purposes.    ,NCT00075335
Healthy,Relatively Healthy Male Veterans Observed Over Time to See What Types of Diseases Develop, The purpose of this study is to gather a mixed racial group of relatively healthy male Veterans (for example White African-American and Hispanic) who are at least 50 years of age. These men will be followed to see what types of diseases they develop and to determine if racial differences in lifestyle blood test results or genes are related to the types of diseases that are found. Diseases of particular interest are prostate cancer other cancers cardiovascular disease (for example heart attacks and stroke) high blood pressure and diabetes. The group to be followed will consist of about 16000 men recruited from about 40 VA Medical Centers across the country. Each man will be followed for at least five years depending on when he enters the study.    ,NCT00076141
Healthy,The Effect of Lopinavir/Ritonavir on Endothelial Function, This study will examine how the anti-HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra® (Registered Trademark)) affects the function of the endothelium (lining of the arteries). Medications such as protease inhibitors can dramatically change the course of HIV infection in many patients; however among their side effects is development of abnormal lipid levels resulting in high cholesterol and insulin resistance. These side effects may damage the lining of the arteries that supply blood to the heart leading to premature coronary artery disease. The study will determine whether lopinavir/ritonavir directly affects endothelial function and whether it alters cholesterol levels glucose tolerance and markers of inflammation in people who take the drug for 4 weeks. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be HIV-negative and have no history of heart disease hypertension or diabetes mellitus. They must not have smoked for at least 6 weeks before entering the study. Volunteers will be screened with a medical history physical examination blood tests (including a pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential) and electrocardiogram. In addition candidates will have an oral glucose tolerance test (see description below). Participants will undergo the following procedures:   -  Lopinavir/ritonavir: 4 weeks (3 capsules twice a day) beginning study day 1   -  Flow-mediated vasodilatation test (study days 0 and 29) - An ultrasound device for measuring the size of the brachial artery (artery in the upper arm) is placed just above the elbow. The size of the artery is measured before and 5 minutes after blood flow to the arm is stopped for 5 minutes using a blood pressure cuff. The artery is also measured before and after taking nitroglycerin a medicine that dilates blood vessels. These measurements tell how well the drug treatment works on the cells lining the brachial artery which is an indicator of coronary artery function. This test takes about 1.5 hours.   -  Forearm blood-flow test (study days 1 and 30): Small tubes are inserted into an artery and vein in the forearm at the inside of the elbow. Blood pressure cuffs are placed around the upper arm and wrist and a strain gauge (a rubber band-like device) is placed around the forearm. When the blood pressure cuffs are inflated blood flows into the forearm stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the blood flow. When the devices are in place a salt water solution is injected in the small tube in the artery. After 20 minutes small doses of the following drugs are given through the catheter at various intervals: 1) L-NMMA (blocks production of nitric oxide a substance produced by the blood vessels that causes them to dilate); 2) sodium nitroprusside (dilates blood vessels increasing blood flow); 3) acetylcholine (lowers blood pressure); and 4) acetylcholine plus L-NMMA. The effect of the different drugs on blood flow in the forearm is measured. The study takes about 2 hours to complete.   -  Blood tests (screening and study days 115 30 and 44)   -  Electrocardiogram (at screening and on study day 30)   -  Oral glucose tolerance test (at screening and on study day 30) - A blood sample is collected. Then the subject drinks 300 milliliters of a glucose solution (a liquid that contains sugar dissolved in water). Two hours after drinking the solution blood is drawn again to examine how the body responds to the increase blood sugar levels.    ,NCT00076414
Healthy,Brain Changes Associated With Learning a Motor Task, This study will determine: 1) whether learning a task with the dominant hand is accompanied by changes in the area of the brain that controls hand movement and 2) how the brain is able to make these changes. Previous studies have shown that practicing a motor task can change brain excitability but it is not known how well brain excitabilities are changed during motor learning. This study will measure changes in activity of the part of the brain that controls hand movement before during and after exercising the hand on a response pad. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates who have not been evaluated at NIH within the past year will be screened with a brief interview about their current state of health and clinical and neurological examinations. Participants will undergo the following procedures: Learning a finger movement/reaction time task For this procedure participants sit in front of a computer monitor with the index middle ring and little fingers placed flat on four corresponding buttons of a response pad. They are asked to press one of the four buttons as fast as they can in response to an asterisk displayed on the monitor. The position of the asterisk indicates which button to push. Subjects perform nine sets of 120-button pushes with a 15-minute rest between each set. During the rest period subjects undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (described below) which causes twitches in the hand muscles. The electrical activity corresponding to the twitches is recorded by attaching electrodes (small metal disks) to the skin over the hand muscles. Transcranial magnetic stimulation For this test an insulated wire coil is held over the scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that electrically stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the scalp under the coil. The stimulation may also cause twitching in the muscles of the face arm or leg. During the stimulation the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions.    ,NCT00076466
Healthy,Spinal Reflexes in Motor Skill Learning, This study will test a spinal cord reflex called reciprocal inhibition before during and after learning a motor skill to see if the reflex becomes stronger by learning the movement. People learn new motor skills throughout their lives. At first performing a new skilled movement such as riding a bicycle takes effort and is clumsy but with practice it becomes relatively automatic. The motor cortex (a part of the brain) is very active when a new skilled movement is learned but becomes less active when the movement is over-learned. This study will determine whether the spinal cord helps coordinate the pattern of activity between groups of muscles once a motor skill is learned. Healthy volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and neurological examination. Participants are divided into two groups. Group 1 has movement training sessions only and Group 2 has both movement training sessions and physiology sessions as follows: Movement training sessions For 15 minutes every weekday participants practice moving their wrist back and forth to make a cursor on the computer screen follow a target. Activity of the arm muscles is monitored with surface electrodes taped to the skin. The sessions continue until the participant can perform the movement well. Group 1 participants return to the clinic a week after the last session to perform the movement again to see if their skill level has changed. Each session lasts about 20 to 30 minutes. Physiology sessions In three separate sessions the reflex for reciprocal inhibition is measured before and at several times during the movement task. This is done with nerve conduction studies. A probe placed on the skin delivers a low-intensity electrical stimulus. Wires taped to the skin record the nerve impulses. To measure reciprocal inhibition several dozen stimuli are given to two nerves in combinations. Each session lasts 2 to 3 hours.    ,NCT00076583
Healthy,Study of Brain Function During Cognitive Tasks, This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine which areas of the brain are involved in performing certain cognitive tasks. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs that provide information about structure and function of tissues. Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be native English speakers and must be right-handed. They must have no history of nervous system disease or psychiatric disorder. Candidates are screened with questionnaires and a neurological examination. Participants undergo functional MRI scanning. For this procedure the subject lies on a stretcher that moves into the scanner - a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the scan he or she is asked to make various decisions about whether words are related or not. Two words are presented visually separated by a variable time delay. The subject reads both words decides as quickly and accurately as possible whether the two words are related or not and indicates the answer by pressing a button. The test takes about 2 hours. When it is completed the subject completes a written questionnaire concerning his or her experience in the scanner.    ,NCT00076739
Healthy,Brain Activity in Visual-Motor Behavior, This study will examine how the brain works when people look at an object follow a moving object with their eyes and reach out their hand to an object. Different areas of the brain work together in reaching out a hand to an object. These areas are also important for concentrating on objects or following them with the eyes. This study will use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to observe more precisely how discrete parts of the brain work during these movements. MEG is a new technique for recording magnetic field changes produced by brain activity. Healthy normal volunteers 20 years of age and older who are right-handed and who have no history of brain or eye disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and brief physical examination. They will complete questionnaires for MEG screening and for determining handedness. Participants undergo MEG recording and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For MEG the subject sits comfortably in front of a computer screen and a cone containing magnetic field detectors is lowered onto the head. Electrodes are placed on both sides of the outer part of the eyelids and just above and below the left eye to monitor eye movement. During MEG subjects perform the following tasks:   1. Eye fixation: A small white cross and a white ring appear on the center of the computer screen. Another white ring moves slowly around the screen in random fashion. Subjects keep their eyes fixed on the central cross and concentrate on the ring at the center ignoring the moving ring.   2. Ocular tracking: The same cross and rings in task 1 appear on the screen but in this task the subjects follow the moving ring with their eyes and ignore the cross and ring in the center.   3. Peripheral manual tracking task (right hand): In addition to the cross and rings in task 1 a small white disc-shaped cursor appears on the screen. Using their right hand subjects use a joystick to move the cursor as precisely as possible to follow the moving ring while keeping their eyes fixed on the central cross.   4. Peripheral manual tracking task (left hand): The same as task 3 except using the left hand.   5. Central manual tracking: The cross rings and joystick are the same as in task 3. Subjects move the cursor to follow the moving ring as precisely as possible while following the moving ring with their eyes and ignoring the cross and ring in the center of the screen. Subjects practice each task before MEG recording starts. Then they perform each task twice in random order with a 1- or 2-minute break between tasks. Subjects who do not have previous MRI images filed in NINDS's database undergo MRI scanning. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Subjects lie still on a table that can slide in an out of the cylinder. They can communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the procedure.    ,NCT00077038
Healthy,Prostanoid Levels After Medication to Prevent Pain Following Third Molar (Wisdom Tooth) Extraction," This study will evaluate how well different medications work to relieve pain following third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction. Scientists believe that hormone-like substances called prostanoids contribute to pain following oral surgery. Prostanoids are produced by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. This study will examine how different medicines inhibit the COX enzymes and reduce the amount of prostanoids and thus the amount of inflammation and pain. The study will also look at genetic factors involved in the production of prostanoids and the response to pain medication. (Only the bottom two wisdom teeth are extracted for this study. Patients whose top wisdom teeth also need to be removed will have those teeth extracted also free of charge at least 2 weeks after the first surgery.) Healthy normal volunteers between 16 and 35 years of age who are in general good health and who require third molar extraction may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and oral examination including dental x-rays as needed to confirm the need for third molar removal. On the morning of surgery patients have blood drawn to obtain DNA for genetic study. Women of childbearing age have a urine pregnancy test. One hour before surgery patients receive a dose of rofecoxib (Vioxx® (Registered Trademark)) acetaminophen (Tylenol® (Registered Trademark)) or placebo (a pill with no active ingredient). A half-hour before surgery they receive either a standard painkiller called keterolac (Toradol® (Registered Trademark))) or placebo through an arm vein. All patients also receive the sedative midazolam (Versed® (Registered Trademark)) also through an arm vein to induce drowsiness and a local anesthetic (lidocaine) to numb the mouth. After the mouth is numbed but before the wisdom teeth are extracted a biopsy (removal of a small piece of tissue) is conducted in the area of the cheek next to the wisdom tooth. After the surgery a small piece of tubing is placed into both extraction sites. Every 20 minutes for the next 3 hours inflammatory fluid is collected from the tubing to measure chemicals that are believed to cause pain and swelling. Patients complete questionnaires every 20 minutes to rate their pain. Those who still have pain an hour after surgery may request and receive a ""rescue drug"" called tramadol (Ultram® (Registered Trademark)) for pain relief. Patients remain in the clinic from 3 to 6 hours to monitor the effects of the study drugs as the anesthetic wears off. After surgery a second biopsy is done to measure any changes in the chemicals being produced in response to the surgery. For this biopsy patients are assigned to one of two groups - one group has the second biopsy within 3 hours of surgery before taking the rescue drug and the other group returns to the clinic the next morning for a biopsy 24 hours after surgery. Patients in the second group leave the clinic after surgery with two pain medications (tramadol and the study drug) and forms to record pain ratings at home. They are permitted to take only the pain medications provided and only at certain times. At the end of their participation in the study all patients are given the pain medication flurbiprofen (Ocufen® (Registered Trademark)) to take at home.    ",NCT00078104
Healthy,Pain Pathways in the Brain," This study will evaluate brain pathways involved in feeling pain and pain relief following administration of pain medication. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to measure brain activity at sites that become more active following oral surgery and then to see if the activity changes after pain medication is administered. MRI combines a powerful magnet with an advanced computer system and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of organs and tissues. During the scan the subject lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member via an intercom system at all times during the procedure. Healthy dental patients recruited through the NIH Clinical Research Volunteer Program may enroll in this study. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures in two clinic visits: Visit 1 - Sensitivity Testing Participants are tested for sensitivity to warm and hot temperatures. A probe is applied to the skin (usually the forearm) and heated to temperatures ranging from room temperature to that of a hot cup of coffee. Participants rate the temperature using a scale ranging from ""no pain"" to the ""worst pain imaginable"" and rate the unpleasantness of the heat using a similar scale. The probe is applied up to 30 times using random heat intensities. Participants are also asked compare the heat intensity to varying levels of sounds and to rate the magnitude of different sensations they have experienced in the past such as the brightness of the sun and the loudness of a jet plane. A blood sample of about 2 ounces is also collected at this visit for DNA analysis to look for genes related to pain. Visit 2 - Oral Surgery Under local anesthetic participants undergo extraction of their lower right wisdom tooth. After surgery the patient is moved to the MRI scanner for brain imaging over 1-2 hours while the local anesthetic wears off. Patients may request a postoperative pain drug (Toradol) during the procedure if needed. When the scan is complete patients are dismissed from the clinic with additional pain medication (flurbiprofen) to use at home as directed.    ",NCT00078364

Healthy,Rhythm Perception and Generation, This study will examine how different brain areas are involved in the perception of rhythmic patterns and the performance of rhythmic movements. Patients with certain types of brain diseases such as Parkinson's disease and some types of stroke may have difficulty performing rhythmic movements such as finger tapping. Healthy right-handed volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates with visual motor or hearing problems are excluded as are musicians and pregnant women. Participants will come to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center for up to six sessions of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. During the MRI the subject lies still for up to 20 minutes at a time on a table in the cylinder and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking noises that occur with the electrical switching of the magnetic fields. He or she can communicate with the MRI staff through a microphone at all times during the procedure. For fMRI images are obtained while the subject performs a task such as hearing sounds or moving a finger. The machine detects changes in brain movement that are involved in performing the task. The tasks are explained and subjects can practice them before entering the scanner.    ,NCT00080067
Healthy,Brain Imaging Technology to Examine the Effects of Meditation, The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to identify the parts of the brain that are activated during meditation and to compare these parts to those activated during other activities. This study will also determine the effects of meditation on involuntary functions such as breathing.    ,NCT00082160
Healthy,G-CSF and AMD3100 to Mobilize Stem Cells in Healthy Volunteers, This 12-day study will test whether the combination of G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) and AMD3100 (Mozobil) is more efficient in mobilizing stem cells for collection than the use of G-CSF alone. Traditionally the growth factor G-CSF has been given to stem cell donors to mobilize or push stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the blood circulation for collection for transplantation. Although a sufficient quantity of cells usually can be collected with G-CSF treatment some donors do not respond well and may require multiple apheresis procedures (see below) to collect enough cells. Studies indicate that G-CSF used together with a drug called AMD3100 may be more effective in mobilizing stem cells for collection than G-CSF alone. The Food and Drug Administration has approved G-CSF for stem cell mobilization. AMD3100 is a new drug that also mobilizes stem cells in large numbers within a few hours. Normal healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study.    ,NCT00082329
Healthy,Role of the Brain in Making Economic Decisions, This study will identify which areas of the brain mediate the interaction between people involved in economic decision-making. Healthy right-handed native English speakers between 21 and 55 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a telephone interview a questionnaire to determine handedness and a neurological examination if one has not been performed within the last year by an NIH physician. Participants bargain for money by playing two-person trust games while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the procedure the subject lies on a stable that can slide in and out of the scanner wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur with electrical switching of the magnetic fields. Functional MRI involves taking MRI scans while the subject performs a task-this to learn about how the brain regions are involved in performing the task. For this test the subject plays or watches two-person games involving trust. The game may be played against a stranger or a friend. The winner receives a cash payoff. The subject performs one of the following two tasks during MRI scanning:   -  Playing the trust games and indicating as quickly as possible by pressing a right or left button whether he or she wants to stop or continue playing or   -  Observing games that others have played and predicting as quickly as possible by pressing a right or left button whether the players wanted to stop or continue the games. The test takes about 90 minutes. After the scan participants complete written questionnaires about their experience in the scanner and their views on issues related to participating in competitive games.    ,NCT00083317
Healthy,Safety and Immunogenicity of an HIV Vaccine in Normal Adult Volunteers," This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV infection and see if it causes an immune response to HIV. The vaccine is given by injection (shot) in the upper arm. It is made from DNA that codes for three HIV proteins. The DNA is inserted into an adenovirus that carries it into the muscle cells. The adenovirus normally can cause eye or upper respiratory infections such as a cold; however for the vaccine it has been modified so that it cannot cause illness. Nor can the vaccine cause HIV infection because it codes for only three of the nine HIV proteins. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 44 years of age who are not HIV-infected may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination and blood and urine tests. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a placebo (an inactive substance that looks like the vaccine). The vaccine or placebo is administered to participants in groups according to their entry into the study. The first group receives the lowest study dose of vaccine. If this dose is safe then the second group receives a higher dose. If this dose is also safe then the third and final group receives the highest study dose. Clinic staff observe the subjects for side effects for 30 minutes after the injection and subjects keep a diary card for the next 5 days recording their temperature and any symptoms that may appear. Subjects are contacted by a nurse 2 days after the injection for follow-up. Participants are seen at the clinic for follow-up visits 1 2 4 12 and 24 weeks after the injection and then are contacted by telephone for follow-up once a year until 5 years after the injection. The clinic visits include a physical examination medical history blood and urine tests and HIV counseling as needed. Women have pregnancy tests at the screening evaluation and again at study week 24. All subjects are tested for HIV at screening and at study weeks 12 and 24 and all subjects complete a ""social impact questionnaire"" at week 24. All subjects are asked questions about their sexual behavior and drug use.    ",NCT00083330
Healthy,Use of [18F]FECNT in Positron Emission Tomography, This study will examine the use of a new radioactive tracer called [18F]FECNT in positron emission tomography (PET) scanning for measuring dopamine transporter (DAT) in the brain. DAT is found in brain neurons (nerve cells) that release the chemical messenger dopamine. By taking pictures of the DAT scientists hope to learn more about the function of these neurons. Normal healthy volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination psychological assessment and blood and urine tests. Subjects enrolled in the study participate in one of the following procedures: Brain Imaging Study: Part 1 Two catheters (small plastic tubes) are placed into veins in the subject's arms for injecting [18F]FECNT and for collecting blood samples during the scan. A third catheter is placed into a wrist artery to obtain arterial blood during the scan. With the catheters in place the subject lies down on the scanner bed with his or her head placed in a special mask that limits movement during the brain scan. The scan begins with an initial x-ray like picture for about 10 minutes after which the [18F]FECNT is injected and the actual PET scan starts. The entire procedure takes about 6 hours including 2 hours of continuous scanning sessions during which the subject is required to lie still. Subjects can relax out of the scanner between scans. They are monitored throughout the procedure. Vital signs are measured and electrocardiogram is taken once before and twice after injection of the tracer. At the end of the scanning additional blood and urine samples are collected. Subjects are asked to urinate every 2 hours to lessen the radioactivity in the body. Whole Body Imaging Study: Part 2 For this procedure a catheter is placed in a vein for injecting the [18F]FECNT tracer. A total of five scans are taken each one spanning from head to upper thigh. During the course of the scans x-ray like pictures are obtained. The first scan takes about 100 minutes. Four additional 1-hour scans are done every 100 minutes. The total time for the scans is about 6 hours and the total time for the entire procedure is about 9 hours. About 2 tablespoons of blood are drawn by needle stick at one time during the imaging. Subjects can leave the PET scanner between scans. They are asked to urinate every 2 hours for 6 hours from the time of tracer injection and to collect all the urine so that radioactivity can be measured. Brain Imaging Study: Part 3 Part 3 of the study is the same as Part 1 except that two PET procedures are done on separate days the second within 4 weeks of the first. In addition participants may also under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning a test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to obtain pictures of the brain.    ,NCT00083629
Healthy,Effect of Respiratory Motion on Positron Emission Tomography Imaging, This study will determine how breathing motions may affect positron emission tomography (PET) scans. It has been discovered that the quality of PET scans varies according to which part of the breathing cycle patients hold their breath. NIH Clinical Center patients 12 years of age and older who are scheduled to have PET and computed tomography (CT) scans as part of their standard medical care may be eligible for this study. Participants have their scheduled PET or CT scan as they normally would and are asked to hold their breath after breathing out as is usual. In addition for this study patients are also asked hold their breath after breathing in and again at a point between breathing in and out. Each breath-hold is for around 15 seconds. The scans for each of the three different breath-holds are examined for differences. Some patients may also be asked to breathe through a tube called a pneumotachometer or spirometer to determine their normal breathing pattern. This involves breathing through a mouthpiece similar to a snorkel mouthpiece and takes about 2 minutes.    ,NCT00088361
Healthy,Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Dopamine Receptors Using the Tracer [11C]NNC-112," This study will investigate the use of [11C]NNC-112 in positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. PET is a technique that uses radioactive isotopes called tracers to provide images of the brain. Injected into the body the isotopes lose their ""radioactive strength"" over time sending out rays that can be picked up and ""seen"" by special detectors connected to a computer. The computer then makes a picture of the brain. This study will examine the distribution in the body of a new tracer called [11C]NNC-112. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 70 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests including a urine drug screen. Women up to age 55 also have a pregnancy test. Participants have a PET scan using the [11C]NNC-112 tracer. For this procedure a catheter (small plastic tube) is placed into a vein in the subject's arm for injecting the tracer. Then the subject lies on the scanner bed. After a preliminary ""transmission scan"" the tracer is injected and PET scans are taken from the head to the upper thigh over a period of about 2 hours to show the distribution of radioactivity in the body. Blood pressure breathing rate and heart rate are checked before and after injection of the tracer and blood and urine samples are collected after the PET scan.    ",NCT00088517
Healthy,Effect of Direct Current Polarization on Brain Function, This study will test a new electrical technique called direct current (DC) polarization that is able to change brain activity in subtle ways for a short time. A recent study showed that depending on its direction the current could make people perform a little better or perhaps slightly worse on a test of the function of the brain's frontal lobe. This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to examine how DC polarization affects brain activity. Healthy volunteers between 20 and 70 years of age who are right handed and who are not taking any medications that affect the brain may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a brief medical history and neurological evaluation. Participants have a PET scan on three different days at least 3 days apart. Each scanning session takes 2-1/2 to 3 hours. For the scan radioactive water is injected into the body through a vein. Subjects lie on a bed that slides in and out of the doughnut-shaped scanner with their head held from the back by a padded holder and in front by a custom-molded plastic mask with holes for the eyes nose and mouth. DC electrodes made of wet sponges are placed on the right side of the head and over the left eye and are held in place with elastic bandages. Three kinds of DC polarization are tested. In two tests the current is the same but in opposite directions. The third is a sham (placebo) condition with no current delivered. Each of the three scans is separated by at least 3 days. On each day a series of scans is done in a single session. Before each injection of tracer the DC current is turned on. This may cause a tingling or slight burning on the skin under the electrodes which disappears when the current is turned off. In each session the subject receives 16 injections of tracer about 8 minutes apart with DC polarization turned on for 4 out of the 8 minutes. During most of the 8-minute periods subjects are shown a pattern of dots about every 2 seconds. Sometimes the subject just looks at the patterns and sometimes subjects are asked to push a button corresponding to the pattern they saw just before the current one. Sometimes they will be asked to push a button corresponding to the pattern that came before that one and so on up to three patterns before the current one. The task lasts for about 2 minutes each time with time to relax in between.    ,NCT00088569
Healthy,Capsaicin to Control Pain Following Third Molar Extraction," Capsaicin to Control Pain Following Third Molar Extraction Summary: This study will test the effectiveness of the drug capsaicin in controlling pain after third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction. Capsaicin the ingredient in chili peppers that makes them ""hot"" belongs to a class of drugs called vanilloids which have been found to temporarily inactivate pain-sensing nerves. If capsaicin alleviates pain in dental surgery it may have potential for use in many types of surgery and painful illnesses. Healthy normal volunteers between 16 and 40 years of age who require third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures in three visits: Visit 1 Patients have touch (sensory) testing inside the mouth using three methods: 1) applying a temperature probe onto the gums and having the patient rate how warm it is; 2) applying a gentle stroke across the gums with the bristles of a small paint brush and having the patient say whether or not it feels painful; and 3) applying a light touch to the gums with a small needle and having the patient rate the pain intensity following the touch. Following touch testing the patient's mouth is numbed with an anesthetic and a small piece of gum tissue next to the lower wisdom tooth is removed (biopsied). Then a small amount of either capsaicin or placebo (saline or salt water) is injected next to the wisdom tooth. Visit 2 Following repeat the touch testing patients are sedated with an injection of midazolam. They then have another biopsy under local anesthesia on the same side of the mouth as the first biopsy. Their mouth is again numbed with an anesthetic and they are given either a pain-relieving medicine called Toradol or a placebo injected into the arm. One lower wisdom tooth is then extracted. After the extraction pain ratings are recorded every 20 minutes for up to 6 hours. During this time patients are monitored for vital signs numbness pain and side effects. Patients who request pain-relief medication are given acetaminophen and codeine. At the end of the study they are discharged from the clinic and given acetaminophen and codeine to take at home as instructed. They are provided a pain diary to record pain ratings and any adverse reactions that might occur until the last visit. Visit 3 Patients return for a follow-up evaluation 48 hours after discharge from the clinic. At the end of the evaluation they are discharged home with flurbiprofen for pain relief. Remaining wisdom teeth are removed ""off-study"" no sooner than 1 week following the first visit.    ",NCT00088686
Healthy,Event Related Potentials in Infants and Adults, This study will explore the development of visual perception and the brain activity that underlies it. It will examine electrical activity in the brain while people are processing characteristics of the visual environment and how that processing might change with development. Infants who are within 2 weeks on either side of their 4-month birthday may be eligible for this study. A parent of the child also participates. Parents who join the study are asked basic questions about their family such as its size and ethnic make-up their infant's birth date complications of pregnancy or delivery and any health problems of the infant such as congenital developmental disorders or visual abnormalities. Each family is seen at the clinic one time for a 45-minute visit. The infant is outfitted with an elastic net containing many small sensors that make contact with the scalp. He or she is then shown pictures on a computer screen. The sensors in the head net are connected to a computer that records the infant's brain activity while the infant watches the pictures on the screen. The head net is moistened with warm water before being applied and is not uncomfortable to wear. Towels are available throughout the session to dry any excess moisture from the net.    ,NCT00088712
Healthy,Investigating the Role of Serotonin in Emotional Processing Through the Use of Tryptophan Depletion, This study will examine the role of serotonin function in the brain. Serotonin one of the brain's natural chemicals connects with receptors on brain cells to regulate emotion anxiety sleep stress hormones and other body functions that are disturbed in various mood and anxiety disorders. Also the research will look at the function of particular brain areas how they are involved in regulating emotions and how serotonin is involved in the regulation of their function. The procedures entailed are tryptophan depletion and magnetic resonance imagining (MRI). Also researchers' understanding of the genetic causes of mood and anxiety disorders will increase through examination of participants' DNA. Adults in good health ages 20 through 50 may be eligible for this study. Among those not eligible are females who are pregnant or breast feeding patients with psychiatric or central nervous system disease and those taking medications that would interfere with study results. At the first visit patients will be asked about their general mood degree of nervousness thinking skills and behavior. The session will last from 1.5 to 2.0 hours. A blood sample of about 2 tablespoons will be drawn for DNA study. Participants will undergo the following procedures and tests:   -  Physical examination.   -  Test of vital signs lying and standing.   -  Electrocardiogram.   -  Collection of blood for chemistry and hematology.   -  Urinalysis.   -  HIV urine drug and hepatitis screening.   -  Psychiatric screening.   -  (SqrRoot) -HCG pregnancy test if applicable. At the second visit patients will receive either tryptophan depletion or placebo and 5 hours later the study will begin to last up to 2 additional hours. Patients will be asked periodically about their emotional state or changes in their well-being. The MRI system will create images of the brain's blood flow and measure glucose metabolism as a measure of brain activity. During the MRI scan patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds and they will wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan and they may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. The MRI session lasts up to 1.5 hours. Results of any medical tests or other information will not be provided to participants because further research may be needed before such results are meaningful. But if meaningful information develops from this study that may be important for a participant's health he or she will be notified about it when it becomes available.    ,NCT00090831
Healthy,Neural Correlates of Observation of Tactile Stimulation in Healthy Subjects, This study will examine activity in the brain during the observation of touch. Studies with animals have shown that mirror neurons or nerve cells are active during the observation and performance of an action. The researchers for this study hypothesize that a similar system pertains to observing and experiencing touch. Patients ages 18 to 75 years old who are in good health are right handed and who are able to perform simple tasks that require attention may be eligible for this study. Pregnant women are not eligible. Patients who have not had a health screening at NIH will undergo a clinical and neurological exam. Women of childbearing potential will also have a pregnancy test. The screening will take about 2 to 3 hours. A diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be performed if patients have not undergone one in the previous 12 months. During the procedure patients will lie still on a table that will slide into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will be asked to lie as still as possible for up to a few minutes at a time. As the scanner takes pictures patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds and they will wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan and they may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. This scan will take about 2 hours. Two sessions are involved in the study. The first one is intended to familiarize patients with the procedure. During it they will learn about hand stimulus through watching a video showing the index finger of a hand being touched by a stick repeatedly. Then the activity will be repeated but this time a researcher will also touch the patient's index finger while he or she is watching the video. This session will take about 1 hour. The second session consists of a functional MRI scan or fMRI. During it pictures of the brain will be taken while patients perform tasks. All tasks will be explained in advance and patients will have an opportunity to practice them before entering the scanner. The fMRI scan will take 1 to 2 hours. The researchers will discuss the results of the tests with the participants. There is not a direct benefit to those who take part in the study. However it is hoped that resulting information will enhance researchers' understanding about how the brain processes observed information.    ,NCT00091533
Healthy,Evaluation of the Safety and Tolerability of a Higher Potency Dose of an Investigational Vaccine Among Adults 50 Years of Age and Older (V211-009), This study compared the safety and tolerability profile of a higher potency investigational vaccine to that of the investigational vaccine at a lower potency dose.    ,NCT00092417
Healthy,Effect of Gabapentin on GABA Concentration and Emotional Processing, This study will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and the drug gabapentin to examine the role of the brain chemical gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) in regulating emotions in healthy people. Gabapentin which is used to treat epilepsy increases GABA concentrations in the brain. MRS similar to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain. Non-smoking healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination psychiatric evaluation blood and urine tests and an electrocardiogram (EKG). At three separate clinic visits participants are given either gabapentin or a placebo (an inactive look-alike capsule). They take placebo at one visit 600 mg of gabapentin at another visit and 1200 mg of gabapentin at another visit. One hour after taking the capsules the amount of GABA in the brain is measured by MRS. For this procedure the subject lies on a table that moves into the MRI scanner (a narrow cylinder) wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 45 to 60 minutes during which the patient is asked to lie still for up to a few minutes at a time.    ,NCT00094510
Healthy,The Functional Anatomy of Personality Trait Knowledge: An fMRI Study," This study will identify the regions of the brain that are involved in personality trait knowledge-that is what a person knows about aspects of personality such as ""generous"" ""honest"" and others. It will also examine brain areas relating to a person's knowledge of how likeable those personality traits are being familiar with the traits and the degree of associating such traits with one's self. There has not been any previous study through modern imaging techniques on the location of the brain and the concepts of personality traits. Patients ages 21 to 65 who are in good health are right handed and native speakers of English may be eligible for this study. Pregnant women are not eligible. There will be 200 participants involved in pencil-and-paper or computer tasks. Also there will be three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments with 32 participants. Patients may participate in up to three fMRI experiments. Patients will be recruited through NIH's Normal Control Database. They would need to have had a neuroexamination conducted by an NIH doctor within the last year. Patients will be interviewed for any medical neurological or psychological condition that would make it difficult to read the fMRI results. Depending on the studies that patients take part in they will have different questionnaires to complete. They may also perform a computerized test that measures word associations. These tests will take about 1 to 2 hours. The technique of MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. During the initial MRI scan patients will lie still on a table that will slide into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will be in the scanner not longer than 2 hours. During the procedure they may be asked to lie as still as possible for up to 1 hour at a time. As the scanner takes pictures patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds and they will wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan and they may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. Then the functional MRI (fMRI) scan will involve taking pictures of the brain while patients are performing tasks. All the tasks will be explained and patients will have the chance to practice them before entering the scanner. For this activity patients will be asked to make decisions about what they are seeing in the tasks presented to them. They will decide ""yes"" and ""no"" by pressing a left or right button. This scan will take about 1 hour. Afterward patients may be asked to fill out written questionnaires or to perform reaction time tasks by using a computer. This study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However it is hoped that information gained will enhance researchers' understanding about which areas of the brain are necessary to perform certain tasks.    ",NCT00095407
Healthy,Impact of Move to Clinical Research Center on Physical Activity of Employees, This study will examine the changes that the move from NIH's Building 10 Clinical Center (CC) into the Clinical Research Center (CRC) may have on the amount of activity a person engages in daily as registered by a pedometer which measures horizontal and vertical steps. The investigators in this study hope to better understand the impact that the move will have had on one group of employees compared with the impact for other groups. Moving to a new work location may require physical activity that is different from what employees currently experience on the job. In the new location they may be walking longer or shorter distances; they may also be climbing fewer or more stairs. In addition they may need to walk more quickly to accomplish the same tasks. It is important to understand how the move from the CC to the CRC influences employees' health well-being and overall function. Physical measures such as blood pressure will be examined. So will how well employees are adjusting to the new location-for example through information about work-related injuries. Clinical Center employees who are able to walk whose move dates allow 10 days in the Clinical Center before the move who wish to participate in the study and are able to wear a pedometer and whose work requirements include a sufficient amount of walking may be eligible for the study. Participants will undergo the following procedures before the move into the CRC and then 1 month after the move. Each evaluation will take about 30 minutes:   -  Brief history about age medical problems and current medications.   -  Measurements of heart rate blood pressure height and weight.   -  Completing a brief questionnaire about the history of injuries such as back pain tendonitis and bursitis. In addition participants will complete a questionnaire about daily life and leisure activities consisting of 94 questions to take about 20 minutes to complete. There will also be a measurement of the distance that participants can walk in 2 minutes. A pedometer will be provided to each participant and will remain the property of that person. Participants will receive a daily log on which to record the number of steps they have walked and the distance as registered by the pedometer. About 5 minutes a day will be needed to record such information. The information that participants provide will be coded. They will not be personally identified nor will the information be discussed with other people including supervisors or co-workers. Information collected will be analyzed for changes in activity patterns and will be analyzed by groups of staff. For example the investigators may wish to compare the activity of nurses before and after the move and then compare that information with information collected from food service workers or personnel serving as messengers or escorts. Participants may find the information gathered to be useful to them as individuals. That is they may learn that their activity has increased as a result of the move to the new location. They may have benefited by having lost weight or lowered their blood pressure.    ,NCT00095485
Healthy,Brain Activities Associated With Different Facial Expressions Using Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent Functional MRI, Objectives: The purpose of this study is to identify areas of brain activation during the urge to yawn. Little is known about how yawning is suppressed or why yawning often occurs in response to seeing another person yawn (contagious yawning). Contagious yawning is similar to other contagious motor programs such as the greater urge Tourette subjects feel to tic when seeing repetitive movements or other subjects' tics the urge to scratch when discussing itching and scratching or the urge to urinate when hearing running water. Hypothetically the urge or the suppression of this urge is modulated by a common cortical circuit implicated in Tourette syndrome. We plan to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the pattern of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation in the brain when normal volunteers feel the urge to yawn. Study Population: We intend to study 25 normal right-handed healthy volunteers. Study Design: Using an event-related design we will scan subjects using the same 3T fMRI scanner while showing a video of a person yawning gaping coughing or doing nothing. Each of these four action stimuli will last for four seconds with varying interstimulus intervals. Each video set will contain all actions displayed ten times pseudorandomly. Two data sets will be collected from each subject and will be separated by a brief rest period. Subjects will be instructed before the scan to watch a videotaped person perform various behaviors without detailing the specific actions. So as not to influence their natural response to the yawning stimulus we will instruct them only to keep their head still. The variable of interest will be the activation during urge-generation contrasted with other control stimuli. A survey will be administered for informational purposes following the scan to assess the subjects' general impression of their susceptibility to yawning whether they yawned in the scanner whether they suppressed the urge to yawn and if the urge to yawn increased or decreased with the repetition of the yawning segment. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome of this study is the activation of brain structures in response to viewing another person yawning. In particular we are interested in the activation of the anterior cingulate cortex parietal operculum insula supplementary motor area and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as these are areas implicated in the urge to move in response to either internal (as in Tourette syndrome) or external (as in itching from histamine injection) states. Since the urge to yawn is the process of interest suppression of yawning is not relevant to the fMRI analysis.    ,NCT00096564
Healthy,Revising Employee Benefits for the Sake of Health, This study will explore ways in which employee benefits may be designed to improve people's health through examining the viewpoints and preferences of low-income people. A person's health is affected not only by being able to receive health care but also by several factors such as income and education. People with lower incomes have been found to be not as healthy as those with higher incomes. While the governments of many countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are currently working on public policy to address this topic the likelihood is small that the United States given its market-based economy will do the same. However owing to the heavy reliance in the United States on employer-sponsored health insurance it would be useful to explore the possibility of insuring some of the measures that people can take to improve their health and to do that through employee benefit packages. Solutions might include extended unemployment insurance more education job training exercise programs help for housing disability insurance and extra retirement benefits. Adults who have a minimum of a sixth-grade reading level have low incomes are English speaking may be eligible for this study. For recruitment 400 people who live and work in the Washington D.C area will be invited to participate and about12 people will take part in each session. Unless people in the study participate during working hours they will each be paid $75 at the conclusion of the session. The study consists of one phase in which participants will engage in a group exercise that lasts for approximately 2-1/2 hours. During that time participants will have the chance to say what employee benefits they would choose if the opportunity arose to improve their health. They will first make those choices by themselves and then make choices along with other people in the group. While group members talk the discussion will be recorded on a tape recorder. Participants will be asked to give information about themselves and their opinions but will not be asked for any information that identifies them personally except for data needed to pay participants with a paycheck. They will also get to use a computer and will be shown how to use it if necessary. If videotaping or photographs are done during the exercise the investigators of the study will ask for separate signed permission to do so. Participants will be asked to respect the privacy of others in the group and to not discuss the opinions of others after leaving the session.    ,NCT00097461
Healthy,Collection of Dental Plaque and Saliva for Studies of Bacterial Colonization of Teeth, This study will explore how bacteria colonize human teeth and how this process changes over the lifetime of individuals. It will include an investigation of transmission of bacteria that initiate colonization between adults and from adults to infants. Selected NIH scientists and members of their immediate families including infants are eligible for this study. Participants provide a small sample of saliva and a sample of bacteria collected by rubbing a cotton swab over the surfaces of the lower four incisors. Adults collect and submit their own specimens; a dentist collects specimens from children.    ,NCT00098267
Healthy,Phase I Study of a Vaccine for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), This study will test whether an experimental vaccine to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is safe causes any side effects and causes an immune response. SARS affects the respiratory system usually starting with fever and muscle aches. Patients may get a dry cough and have difficulty breathing. Infection may be mild but it can lead to death. Vaccines contain substances from an infectious agent such as a virus that when injected into a person's body stimulates production of antibodies that create resistance or immunity to that agent. The vaccine in this study contains genetic material (DNA) that codes for a protein found in the virus that causes SARS. Injected into a muscle it instructs the body to make a small amount of a SARS protein. The vaccine is made from just one small part of the code for one SARS protein; a person cannot get SARS from the vaccine. Normal volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age who are in general good health may be eligible for this 32-week study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests. Participants have nine clinic visits during the study. They receive three vaccine injections given with a system called the Bioinjector 2000® (Registered Trademark) which delivers the vaccine through the skin without the use of a needle. Following each injection participants take home a diary card on which they record their temperature and any vaccine side effects daily for 5 days. Participants must immediately report any symptoms to a study physician and if necessary go to the clinic for an examination. Participants have the following tests and procedures:   -  Vaccine injections (study day 0 around week 4 and around week 8 with at least 21 days between injections)   -  Medical history and if needed physical examination (study day 0 and weeks 2 4 6 8 10 12 24 and 32)   -  Check of vital signs and weight (study day 0 and weeks 2 4 6 8 10 12 24 and 32)   -  Lymph node examination (day 0 and weeks 2 4 6 8 10 and 12)   -  Blood draw (study day 0 and weeks 2 4 6 8 10 12 24 and 32)   -  Pregnancy test for women (day 0 and weeks 4 8 and 32)   -  Urine sample (day 0 and weeks 2 4 6 8 10)    ,NCT00099463
Healthy,Implementing the Assent Requirement for Research With Children," One of the principal safeguards mandated by the Federal Regulations governing clinical research with children is the assent requirement: children who are capable must provide an affirmative agreement to participate unless the research ""holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health or well-being of the children and is available only in the context of the research"" (46.408). Despite the importance of the assent requirement the Federal regulations offer no guidelines on its implementation. In the present study we propose to survey children and one of their parents in order to obtain information concerning children's role in making decisions concerning their participation in clinical research. Five elements of children's involvement in the decision-making process with respect to their participation in clinical research will be assessed: 1) receipt of information concerning the available options; 2) understanding of this information; 3) assessment of the available options; 4) expression of a preferred option; and 5) coordination with parental decision-making. Three groups will be enrolled: 1. Minor/Parent pairs where the minor is participating in or is in follow-up for a drug treatment research study for cancer 2. Minor/Parent pairs where the minor is participating in or is in follow-up for a drug treatment research study for asthma and 3. Minor/Parent pairs where the minor is receiving on-going clinical care for asthma. Children 7-14 years of age will be enrolled. Total enrollment will be 400 subject pairs approximately 150 in cancer research 150 in asthma research and 100 involved in clinical care for asthma with approximate balance between the sites. Two formalized survey instruments - research/clinical minor research/clinical parent - will be developed in consultation with Research Triangle Institute (RTI).    ",NCT00102076
Healthy,HIV-1 Vaccine Booster in Previously Immunized Uninfected Adult Volunteers," This study will test the safety and side effects of an experimental vaccine booster against HIV. A vaccine is a substance given to try to create immunity or resistance to a disease or infection. The vaccine used in this study is called VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP. It is made from an adenovirus (a common virus that causes upper respiratory infections) that contains DNA (genetic material) of three HIV proteins. Injected into a human the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP will be given to people who previously received a vaccine called VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP under NIH protocol 03-I-0022. Important: Study participants cannot catch an adenovirus infection or HIV or AIDS from the vaccine or any proteins made from it. Healthy normal volunteers who participated in NIH protocol 03-I-0022 may be eligible for this study. They must have completed three injections of 4 mg or 8 mg of VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP without experiencing a serious side effect that was possibly related to the vaccine. Candidates are screened with a medical history clinical evaluation blood and urine tests and HIV and pregnancy counseling. Participants receive one injection of VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP the day they enroll in the study (study day 0). They are observed for at least 30 minutes after immunization. At home they record their temperature and any symptoms they may experience including any effects at the injection site for 5 days and call a study nurse 1 or 2 days after the injection. They immediately report any symptoms to the clinic staff and if necessary come to the clinic for an examination. Participants have five additional clinic visits during the study at weeks 2 4 6 12 and 24 each lasting about 2 hours. At each visit they are checked for health changes or problems and are asked about medications they are taking. Blood is drawn for immune function testing HLA typing (a genetic test of immune system markers) and other genetic factors. A urine sample is collected at some visits. Additional laboratory tests may be requested between visits. Some participants may undergo apheresis at the week 4 visit to collect a large number of white blood cells for laboratory tests to see how the immune system responds to the study vaccine. For this procedure blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and flows through a catheter (plastic tube) into a machine that separates it into its components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells are extracted and the rest of the blood is returned through another needle in the other arm. The procedure takes about 1 to 3 hours. Participants are tested three or more times for HIV and are questioned about their sexual behavior and drug use. They complete a ""social impact"" questionnaire at week 24 that includes questions about any problems they may have experienced from their participation in the study regarding such things as insurance health care friends family employment housing education or government agencies.

Healthy,Nitrite Infusion Studies, This study will examine 1) how nitrite (a natural blood substance that relaxes blood vessels) increases blood flow and lowers blood pressure and 2) how to increase the effects of nitrite on blood pressure. Healthy volunteers between 21 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study. They must be non-smokers and have no history of high blood pressure high cholesterol or diabetes. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination electrocardiogram and blood tests. This study is either done in the NIH Clinical Center intensive care unit or on the general clinical ward. Participants are enrolled in Part A of the study. After completion of Part A participants will be enrolled in Part B of the study. Part A: Participants lie in a reclining chair during the study. Small catheters (plastic tubes) are inserted into an artery and vein in the forearm. Another tube is placed in the vein of the opposite arm. Blood pressure cuffs are placed around the upper arm and wrist and a strain gauge (a rubber band-like device) is placed around the forearm. This device helps us to measure blood flow through the arm. When the blood pressure cuffs are inflated blood flows into the forearm stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the blood flow. Pressure cuffs and a strain gauge are also placed on the other arm. After 20 minutes blood pressure and blood flow are measured in both forearms. Then blood is drawn from the tube in the right vein to measure blood counts proteins and other chemicals. Participants then are given small doses of either saline ascorbic acid or a medicine called oxypurinol a form of a drug that is often taken to prevent gout. After 30 minutes sodium nitrite is injected in increasing doses into the artery for 30 minutes. Blood flow is measured and blood is drawn every 5 minutes during the infusion. At the end of the 30 minutes blood is drawn from the vein every 30 minutes for 3 hours. After 3 hours sodium nitrite infusions are restarted for 2 hours and blood flow is measured and samples collected every 30 minutes during this period. Part B: Participants lie in a reclining chair during the study. A small catheter (plastic tube) is placed in the artery of the left forearm to draw blood samples. A larger catheter called a central line is placed in a deeper vein in the neck. Another tube is advanced through the central line into the chambers of the heart through the heart valve and into the lung artery to measure pressures in the heart and lungs. Blood is drawn after 30 minutes to obtain baseline measurements. Then saline (sterile salt water) is put into the tube in the lung artery. Blood pressure cuffs are placed around the upper arm and wrist and a strain gauge (a rubber band-like device) is placed around the forearm which helps us to measure flow through the arm. When the cuffs are inflated blood flows into the forearm stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the blood flow. Pressure cuffs and a strain gauge are also placed on the other arm. After 20 minutes blood pressure and blood flow are measured in the forearm and blood samples are drawn from the tube in the left artery to measure blood counts proteins and other chemicals. Subjects then breathe a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen through a facemask for 30 minutes then room air for 30 minutes and then the oxygen and nitrogen mixture for another 30 minutes. While breathing the mixture the second time sodium nitrite is injected through the tube in the artery in three increasing doses for 5 minutes each. Every 5 minutes during the infusion blood is drawn from the tubes in the neck. Forearm blood flow is also measured every 5 minutes. After 30 minutes the subject breathes room air for 3 hours and 15 minutes and then the sodium nitrite is injected again in three increasing doses for 5 minutes each. Every 5 minutes during the infusion blood is taken from the tube in the neck and forearm blood flow is measured    ,NCT00102271

Healthy,Drug Interactions of Echinacea Ginseng and Ginkgo Biloba Taken With Lopinavir/Ritonavir in Healthy Volunteers, This study will examine the interaction of the HIV combination medication lopinavir/ritonavir with the herbal products echinacea ginseng and ginkgo biloba. Patients with HIV infection often take herbal products and dietary supplements in addition to their doctor-prescribed medicines to treat the disease lessen the side effects of anti-viral drugs and improve their overall well being. Alternative medicines such as these may however interfere with the elimination of lopinavir/ritonavir from the body causing either higher or lower blood levels of these drugs than would be expected. This study will assess in healthy subjects any potential harms of taking echinacea ginseng or ginkgo biloba together with lopinavir/ritonavir. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a history physical examination and blood tests including an HIV test and a pregnancy test for women. Pregnant women are excluded from the study. Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center after fasting overnight for the following procedures: Visits 1 and 2: A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in an arm vein to collect blood samples. After the first sample is drawn the subject takes 8 mg of midazolam syrup and two fexofenadine tablets. Midazolam is a sedative and fexofenadine (Allegra) is a medicine used to treat allergies. Subjects are given breakfast an hour after taking the drugs. Blood samples are collected at 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 5 6 8 and 24 hours after taking the drugs to measure blood levels of fexofenadine. An extra sample is collected at the 4-hour mark to measure the midazolam level. The catheter is removed after the 8-hour blood draw and subjects are dismissed home. They return the following morning (visit 2) for the 24-hour blood draw. Visit 3: From 7 to 28 days after visit 1 subjects begin taking lopinavir/ritonavir capsules twice a day by mouth for a total of 29.5 days. On day 15 they return to the clinic for lopinavir/ritonavir blood levels as were done for fexofenadine except that samples are collected once before breakfast and then at 0.5 1 2 3 4 6 8 and 12 hours after the lopinavir/ritonavir dose. An extra sample is collected for routine tests. The catheter is removed after the 12-hour draw and the subject is dismissed home. The next morning subjects begin taking one of the following: echinacea 500 mg 3 times a day; ginkgo biloba 120 mg twice a day; or ginseng 500 mg 3 times a day for 28 days. Visit 4: On the last day of taking lopinavir/ritonavir subjects return to the clinic again for blood level measurements of these drugs as on visit 3 except that the catheter is removed and the subject dismissed home after the 8-hour blood draw. Visits 5 and 6: On the last day of taking the herbal supplement subjects return to the clinic for repeat measurement of fexofenadine and midazolam levels as described in visits 1 and 2. At the final visit (visit 6) an additional blood sample is collected for repeat laboratory testing.    ,NCT00103012
Healthy,Nitrite Infusion in Healthy Volunteers, This study will determine the dose of sodium nitrite that can safely be used to prevent constriction or tightening of the arteries. Narrowed arteries in the brain can cause stroke. Animal studies show that nitrite injections improve blood flow and that injections over long periods of time prevent damage to the arteries in the brain; however there is no information on the effects of prolonged nitrite infusion in humans. This study will establish the safe dose and side effects of nitrite infusion in humans. Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened for high or low blood pressure aspirin use pregnancy and blood levels of nitrite and methemoglobin (a substance that temporarily and slightly lowers the oxygen carried in the red blood cells). Pregnant women are excluded from the study. Participants are admitted to the Clinical Center for 16 1/4 days the first 2 days in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). Upon admission they provide a medical history have physical and cardiovascular examinations and blood tests. For the infusion procedure a catheter (thin plastic tube) is inserted into an artery in the wrist or the crease of the elbow to measure blood pressure and catheters are placed in a vein in each arm for administering the nitrite and withdrawing blood samples. In the morning of day 1 after initial blood pressure and heart rate measurements are taken and a blood sample is drawn a saline (salt water) infusion is started. Blood pressure and heart rate are monitored every 30 minutes for 6 hours then every hour for 6 hours then every 2 hours for 12 hours. Blood samples are collected every 4 hours for 24 hours. On day 2 the sodium nitrite infusion begins. Blood pressure and methemoglobin are monitored every 10 minutes for the first 2 hours. If blood pressure remains stable the frequency of measurements is decreased to every 30 minutes for 4 hours then every 1 hour for the next 6 hours and then every 4 hours for 12 hours. If the pressure continues to remain stable monitoring continues every 8 hours for the rest of the study. Blood is drawn periodically from the catheter to determine the amount of nitrite and methemoglobin in the body with decreasing frequency from several times during the first hour of the infusion to every 24 hours. After the first 24 to 48 hours of the nitrite infusion participants are transferred from the ICU to a general nursing unit fo...    ,NCT00103025

Healthy,Effect of Surface Electrical Stimulation on Movement of the Larynx," This study will examine whether surface electrical stimulation on the skin of the throat will: 1) move the larynx (voice box); 2) move the vocal folds in the larynx; and 3) cause less movement of the larynx when applied during swallowing. It is important that the larynx moves up and forward while swallowing so that food does not go into the airway. A device called VitalStim® (Registered Trademark) which provides electrical stimulation to the skin on the neck and under the chin is widely used to treat people who have problems swallowing. This study will determine if VitalStim can move the voice box or the vocal folds in the larynx. This information is important for patients who have long-term problems raising or closing their larynxes when they swallow. Healthy volunteers between 20 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination electrocardiogram and nasoendoscopy. For the latter procedure the inside of the subject's nose is sprayed with a decongestant opening the nasal passages. A small flexible tube called a nasoendoscope is passed through the nose to the back of the throat. The scope allows observation of the larynx while the subject speaks sings whistles and makes prolonged vowel sounds. Participants are familiarized with the VitalStim device before beginning the experimental procedures. The device consists of two sets of electrodes and a stimulation unit. The electrodes are placed on the neck and under the chin. Stimulation causes different sensations according to the intensity level. They include ""tingling/crawling"" ""vibrating"" ""warm/burning"" and ""grabbing."" Subjects then undergo the following procedures:   -  Nasoendoscopy with muscle stimulation: The inside of the nose is sprayed with a decongestant and the nasoendoscope is passed through one nostril to the back of the throat. Electrodes are placed on the throat area and under the chin. Stimulation is delivered 10 times at various places on the neck and under the chin while the subject sits quietly. This test shows if the vocal folds in the voice box move with surface electrical stimulation.   -  Videofluoroscopy with muscle stimulation at rest and during swallowing: This is an x-ray study of the head and neck during swallowing and at rest to determine how stimulation affects the level of the voice box in the neck. Electrodes are placed under the chin and on the throat. The subject swallows 5 milliliters of barium a contrast material that can be seen easily on x-ray. The x-ray machine is turned on for a few seconds at a time during each swallow of the barium and another 10 times while the subject is remaining still without swallowing.    ",NCT00104000
Healthy,Effect of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Memory, This study will examine the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on short-term memory in healthy adults. Healthy people use their brains to answer short-term memory questions in a different way than do patients with schizophrenia. Attention and memory deficits in schizophrenia patients significantly hamper their recovery and rehabilitation yet there are no effective treatments for these impairments. TMS is a method of brain stimulation that may be able to change the electrical activity of the nerve cells of the brain and improve certain brain functions. This study will explore the effect of TMS on memory and perhaps discover brain processes that may be helpful in developing new ways to treat schizophrenia. Healthy volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age excluding pregnant women may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  Medical history physical examination blood tests electrocardiogram (EKG) and urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.   -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). These tests are done in participants who have not had structural and functional MRIs as participants in NIMH's 2-day schizophrenia study within 90 days of entering the current study. MRI is done to locate the place in the brain to simulate with TMS and fMRI is done to look at brain activity while the subject solves short-term memory tasks. Both tests are done at the same session. Before the scan four vitamin E capsules are taped to the subject's scalp. After the capsules are in place the subject lies on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner - a narrow cylinder with a strong magnetic field. During the scan subjects are asked to do some simple tests such as watching pictures on a screen or pressing buttons in response to numbers they were shown a few seconds earlier. Scanning may take up to 2 hours but usually lasts between 45 and 90 minutes.   -  TMS. For this procedure subjects receive either active TMS or a sham procedure (placebo) that imitates TMS but does not use real electrical stimulation. For TMS an insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp and a brief electrical current is passed through it. This generates magnetic pulses that travel through the scalp and skull and cause small electrical currents in the cortex or outer part of the brain. The stimulation may cause muscle twitching in the scalp or face and may also cause small movement of the limbs. During the procedure electrodes are taped to the scalp to record the electrical activity of the brain while short-term memory is tested. Two tests make up a set. There are a total of six test sets; each set takes about 3 minutes. Five periods of electrical stimulation are delivered before each test set. Each period of stimulation lasts 5 seconds followed by a 10-second rest period. The stimulation-rest intervals continue until five periods of TMS have been applied. For the memory test subjects press a key on a computer keyboard as quickly and accurately as possible in a test of their ability to remember a string of numbers or letters.   -  Questionnaires. At the beginning and end of the TMS session participants fill out questionnaires that assess their mood ability to concentrate and level of anxiety.    ,NCT00105118
Healthy,Effect of Nitrite on Exercise Physiology and Metabolism, This study will examine how nitrite infusions affect exercise tolerance (how much a person can exercise before having to stop). Exercise ability is limited by how fast oxygen can be delivered to the body and how fast the body can produce energy. Both of these processes are affected by nitric oxide (NO) a gas produced by cells that line blood vessels. NO is important in regulating blood vessel dilation and consequently blood flow. Nitrite may act as a storehouse for nitric oxide and be able to improve exercise tolerance. Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 45 years of age who can use an exercise bicycle may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination electrocardiogram breathing tests blood tests and a pregnancy test for women who are able to bear children. Pregnant women are excluded from the study. The screening session includes practice exercise on the bicycle. Participants exercise on a stationery exercise bicycle for about 30 minutes on each of two study days. During the test they breathe in and out of a mouthpiece that allows inhaled and exhaled respiratory gases to be measured. Before subjects begin to exercise a small tube is placed in the artery of their forearm inside the elbow. A longer tube called a central line is placed in a deeper vein in the neck after the area has been numbed. A thinner tube called a pulmonary artery catheter is placed through the central line and advanced into the chambers of the heart through the heart valve and into the lung artery. This catheter measures various pressures directly in the heart and lungs. Blood samples are drawn through the catheter also to avoid the need for multiple needle sticks. Another tube is placed in the vein of the other arm to deliver medications. Thirty minutes after all the tubes are placed a blood sample is drawn for baseline measurements. Then either saline (sterile salt water) or nitrite is injected into the tube in the arm vein. Thirty minutes after the injection the subject starts exercising on the bicycle. The work setting on the bicycle is increased every minute and the subject pedals until he or she is too tired to continue. During the test a small blood sample is collected every 2 minutes. Heart rate blood pressure and heart rhythms are continuously monitored. After the test on the first day participants are admitted to the hospital to rest for the remainder of the afternoon and evening. The tubes are kept in place for the following morning when the procedure is repeated exactly as before except that subjects who received saline the first day are given nitrite the second day and vice versa.    ,NCT00105222
Healthy,Vaccine to Prevent West Nile Virus Disease, This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine intended to prevent West Nile virus (WNV) infection and determine if it causes side effects. WNV symptoms may vary from fever and headache to a polio-like syndrome with paralysis. Infection rarely results in death. The vaccine used in this study contains DNA that instructs the body to produce a small amount of a protein found in WNV. If the body creates resistance or immunity to these proteins then the vaccine may protect against WNV. Study participants cannot get WNV from the vaccine. Healthy volunteers between 18 years and 50 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests including a pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant. Patients undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  Vaccine injections: Vaccines are given as injections in the upper arm using a needleless system called the Biojector 2000. The first injection is on study day 0 the second on day 28 (+/-) 7 days and the third on day 56 (+/-) 7 days. There must be at least 21 days between injections. The pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential is repeated the day of each vaccine injection.   -  Diary card: Participants are given a 5-day diary card after each injection to record their temperature and any symptoms and side effects they may experience for up to 5 days after the injection. The diary cards are returned to the clinic at visits scheduled 2 weeks after each injection. Side effects and symptoms also must be reported immediately to a study nurse or doctor and a clinic visit may be required for an examination.   -  Clinic visits: At day 0 and weeks 2 4 6 8 10 12 24 and 32 participants have a medical history physical examination (if needed) and blood tests. Vital signs and weight are also recorded. Lymph nodes are examined at day 0 and weeks 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 and urine samples are collected at day 0 and weeks 2 4 6 8 and 10. Some of the blood drawn during this study is used for genetic tests to see if different types of immune response to a vaccine are related to genetic differences in people.    ,NCT00106769

Healthy,Vaccine Treatment for HIV-Infection," This study will determine the safety and side effects of an experimental adenoviral vector vaccine given to patients who previously received a different HIV vaccine (VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP) in a prior NIAID study. The study will also monitor participants for the social impact of being in an HIV vaccine study (e.g. problems with insurance health care friends family employment housing and so forth). The study vaccine is made using an adenovirus (a common virus that causes upper respiratory infections such as the common cold eye infection urine infection or diarrhea) that has been modified to contain DNA that codes for three HIV proteins. The modified virus cannot reproduce in the body and cannot cause HIV disease or adenoviral infections. Healthy volunteers who previously received three injections of the VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP under the NIAID study VRC 007 (protocol 04-I-0254) may be eligible for this study. Participants receive one injection of the adenoviral vector vaccine. It is given the day they enroll in the study as a single injection in an upper arm muscle. Also on that day they have a brief physical examination medical history blood and urine tests pregnancy test for women and counseling as needed about HIV and pregnancy avoidance. Subjects are observed for side effects for at least 30 minutes after the vaccination and are required to telephone the clinic staff 1 to 2 days after the injection for follow-up. In addition they are given a diary card to take home on which they record their temperature and any symptoms daily for 5 days. Subjects return to the clinic for 5 follow-up visits at weeks 2 4 6 12 and 24 after the injection. At each visit they are checked for health changes or problems since the last visit asked how they are feeling and what medications they are taking. They have blood drawn at every visit and urine samples collected at most visits. They are tested for HIV three or more times and are questioned about their sexual behavior and drug use. They also complete a ""social impact"" questionnaire at the last visit. Subjects are asked to undergo apheresis at the week 4 visit. This procedure allows collection of a larger number of white blood cells than can be obtained by a simple blood draw. The white cells are studied to see how the immune system responds to the study vaccine. For apheresis blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and spun in a machine that separates the components. The white blood cells are extracted and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through the same needle. Subjects who do not undergo apheresis have about 1/3 cup of blood sample drawn using a needle.    ",NCT00108654

Healthy,Safety and Dosing Evaluation of REG1 Anticoagulation System," This 1-week study will test the safety and dosing of an anticoagulation system called REG1 that is designed to improve control of ""blood thinning."" Patients with heart attack and other conditions require treatment with an anticoagulant (blood thinner) to prevent the formation of blood clots. However anticoagulation therapy can increase the risk of bleeding. The REG1 system is designed to minimize this risk. One part of the system stops the activity of factor IX (a protein that helps blood clot) while the other part of the system (the antidote) inactivates the drug and stops the thinning process. This study will examine in normal healthy subjects how the REG1 system works in the body and how it leaves the body. Healthy normal volunteers between 12 and 65 years of age who weigh 50-120 kilograms (110-264 pounds) and have no history of bleeding problems or significant bleeding may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination and blood tests. Participants must avoid foods that may alter the blood's clotting ability and must not take any medications the week of the study. They undergo the following tests and procedures: Day 1 Subjects are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for an overnight stay. Two catheters (plastic tubes) are placed in the subject's arm veins one for drawing blood samples and the other for injecting one of the following: REG1 drug REG1 antidote REG1 drug and antidote or placebo. Two injections of study medication are given spaced 3 hours apart each over a 1-minute period. After each injection blood is collected at specific times to measure levels of the drug or antidote in the body and the blood's ability to clot. Subjects also provide a 24-hour urine collection and stool sample. Day 2 A blood sample is drawn 24 hours after the drug or antidote injection from the previous day. If the blood test result is normal subjects are discharged home with instructions to follow. They return to the Clinical Center at 36 hours and 48 hours for additional blood samples. Days 3 and 7 A blood sample is collected at the end of day 3 and day 7. Urine and stool samples are also collected.    ",NCT00113997

Healthy,Interhemispheric Plasticity in Humans, This study will determine how the brain controls movements by sending messages to the spinal cord and muscles. Researchers want to know if strengthening a hand muscle will increase the strength of the same muscle in the other hand and if these changes happen in the brain or spine or both. Plasticity in this study refers to the capacity for continuous changes of the neural pathways in the brain and nervous system. Researchers have seen cases in which using a muscle extensively (force production) in one muscle group has increased the strength of the same muscle group on the opposite side of the body (force transfer). This situation happens without the unused muscle becoming larger-suggesting that the practice causes changes in some parts of the brain or spine. It is vital for scientists to know how this effect works so that they can create new rehabilitation methods for people who cannot move or who have difficulty moving one side of their body. Patients ages 18 to 60 who are in good health and who do not have a history of major conditions affecting the bones joints or nervous system may be eligible for this study. Patients will undergo a medical examination. There will be 1 or 2 testing sessions 20 training sessions and 1 or 2 final testing sessions with patients being asked to come to the laboratory for as few as 4 times (about 10 hours total) or for up to 25 visits (about 20 hours total). The investigator will indicate which of six different groups that a patient is selected for. During testing sessions the strength of the pointer and little fingers in each hand will be determined through the use of very brief electrical pulses. There also will be transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and 1 Hz TMS. The researchers will place one or two wire coils on the patient's scalp and make marks on the scalp which will be removed at the end of the session. During the TMS a brief electrical current is passed through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Patients will hear a click sound and feel a snapping sensation on the skin. They may also feel and see small twitches in the hand muscles and the fingers or wrist may move. There will be a total of about 300 magnetic stimuli at a rate of 10 pulses per minute. Patients will also have an electromyogram (EMG) a procedure recording electrical activity in the muscles that are activated by electrical or magnetic stimulation. Metal electrodes will be attached to the skin over the muscle. During the EMG patients will be asked to tense certain muscles slightly. Depending on the group a patient is assigned to he or she may be asked to use the right index finger by using voluntary muscle movement electrical stimulation his or her imagination electrical stimulation of a different hand muscle or voluntary movements immediately followed by repetitive TMS. Regardless of group assignment there will be five blocks of 10 repetitions of finger exercise per session 200 per week and 1000 throughout the whole study. During the study sessions patients will be able to talk and move around. They can take a break and leave the room if needed. In most cases the session will take less than 2 hours. There also will be a control group whose members will not be training their fingers but who will participate only in the testing sessions. TMS is a safe procedure; however strong contractions of scalp muscles have been known to cause headaches. Also because of the distracting noise of the TMS patients will be fitted with earplugs to wear during the procedure. Compensation for research-related discomfort and inconvenience will be made to participants with a maximum of $500 to $600 depending on assignment to groups. This study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However researchers hope to gain information that will help them better understand how the two sides of the brain control movement and how they affect each other regarding movement control.    ,NCT00120666

Healthy,Mirroring a Movement," This study will determine if the type of gesture increased quantity of an image and the number of times a face is shown repeating a gesture bring about activation in the ""mirror neurons."" Researchers aim to learn about which areas of the brain are necessary to perform certain cognitive tasks-that is relating to a person's thinking or remembering-especially visual and motor tasks. Because one way humans learn is by imitation a mechanism is required to transfer the behavior the person adopts from others through observation. This type of learning could be based on a mechanism similar to that provided by mirror neurons. From previous studies it has been learned that the observation of hands and mouths has brought about the most effective ways of activating the mirror neurons. Patients ages 21 to 55 who are in good health are right handed are not pregnant and are native speakers of English may be eligible for this study. There will be about 24 participants. Patients will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Before the scan they will complete a safety questionnaire about the presence of any metal in their bodies. Patients are at risk for injury from the MRI magnet if they have pacemakers dental implants or other devices. Female patients will undergo a pregnancy test. The technique MRI uses includes a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. During the initial MRI scan patients will lie still on a table that will slide into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will be in the scanner for about an hour. During the procedure they may be asked to lie as still as possible for up to 20 minutes at a time. As the scanner takes pictures patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds. Each participant will wear earplugs to reduce this noise. They will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan and they may ask to be removed from the machine at any time. The functional MRI (fMRI) scan will involve taking pictures of the brain while patients are performing tasks. All the tasks will be explained and patients will have the chance to practice them before entering the scanner. During the fMRI patients will view short film segments of people making gestures. Before and after the scan patients will be asked to complete several short questionnaires. The testing sessions will take a total of about 2 hours. Participants will receive compensation for their time and inconvenience with a maximum payment of $200. This study will not have a direct benefit for participants.    ",NCT00123448

Healthy,Pharmacokinetics of Mycophenolate Mofetil in Healthy Volunteers, This study will examine how people differ in the way their bodies process and eliminate mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) a drug that is used to treat problems affecting the eye and immune system and to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients. MMF is metabolized by a group of enzymes called UGTs each of which is made by a different gene. This study will investigate whether people with different UGT genes differ in how well their bodies use and remove MMF. The results may help scientists learn the best way to give MMF to patients. Normal healthy volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests including a blood test for analysis of genes that control and regulate UGTs. Pregnant women and nursing mothers are excluded from the study. Women who are able to have a child and men who can father a child must either abstain from sex or use two reliable forms of birth control during the study and for 3 months after its completion. Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center at 6:30 a.m. on the first day of the study and stay in the outpatient clinic for 12 hours. The next 4 mornings they return to the Clinical Center for a single blood collection. The procedures for the 5 days are as follows: Day 1 Upon arrival at the Clinical Center a catheter is inserted into the subject's arm vein.

Healthy,Study Comparing Thyrogen Versus a Modified Release of Recombinant Human Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, Forty-six (46) eligible healthy subjects who provide written informed consent will be enrolled to participate in a 2 arm parallel group study to assess and compare the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of Thyrogen dosed at 0.1 mg versus a modified release formulation of recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhTSH) dosed at 0.1 mg. Ten (10) of these subjects will have the thyroid uptake of radioiodine (123I) measured at baseline and following their single dose of study medication. All doses will be administered via intramuscular (IM) injection. Following confirmation of study eligibility subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single administration of 0.1 mg of Thyrogen (THYR) or 0.1 mg of the modified release. Randomization will be stratified by whether or not patients will have the thyroid uptake of radioiodine (123I) measured following their single dose of study medication. Five (5) patients in each treatment arm will have uptake measured while 18 in each arm will not. Each subject will have blood samples taken to determine the pharmacokinetics of serum TSH at -12 hours and just prior to dosing and at various hours up to 14 days following the administration of Thyrogen or the modified release formulation. In addition for the evaluation of pharmacodynamics each subject will have samples of blood taken to determine serum free T4 total T4 free T3 and total T3 at -12 hours and just prior to dosing and at various hours up to 14 days following the administration of study treatments. All subjects will undergo a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) just prior to dose administration and 1 2 3 4 5 7 10 and 14 days following study treatment administration. In addition subjects will undergo 24 hours of Holter monitoring at baseline and four (4) consecutive 24-hour Holter monitoring sessions post treatment to yield a total of 96 hours of continuous monitoring of cardiac function following treatment administration. All subjects will undergo ultrasound evaluations to determine thyroid volume at baseline and 48 hours following treatment administration. Twenty-four hours following the administration of Thyrogen or the modified release formulation a subset of five (5) subjects in each treatment arm will receive a dose of 123I prepared to be 400µCi on the day of radioiodine administration based on the utilized nuclear pharmacy's calibration schedule. Thyroid gland uptake will be measured via a probe in these 10 subjects at 6 24 and 48 hours following radioiodine administration. Blood chemistry complete blood count (CBC) urinalysis and a physical exam will be conducted 14 days after treatment administration or at the time of early termination as a final safety assessment. Each subject's duration of study participation will be approximately 4 weeks.    ,NCT00137891

Healthy,Specific Effects of Escitalopram on Neuroendocrine Response," Citalopram a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is used as a neuroendocrine probe in human subjects to assess serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) function as reflected in prolactin and plasma cortisol release. Citalopram is a racemic mixture of equal parts of the S(+) and R(-) enantiomers. The S(+) form (""escitalopram"") has been identified as being the active isomer and inhibitor of serotonin reuptake and consequently antidepressant activity is associated almost exclusively with the S-enantiomer. Escitalopram has been shown to be approximately twice as potent as citalopram at the primary high-affinity binding site on the human serotonin transporter. Interestingly investigations have suggested an antagonistic interaction of the R- and S-enantiomer at an allosteric binding site on the serotonin transporter. This antagonism has been shown in animal studies where the addition of R-citalopram to escitalopram treatments significantly counteracts the antidepressant and anti-anxiolytic effects of escitalopram. From these clinical and experimental data the researchers can anticipate that escitalopram would increase cortisol and prolactin in the neuroendocrine challenge paradigm more effectively than citalopram.

Healthy,Comparative Effects of Azithromycin Telithromycin and Levofloxacin on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes, Studies have previously shown that a broad drug interaction screening can be performed using enzyme specific probes such as oral caffeine for CYP1A2 N-acetyltrasferase-2 (NAT-2) and xanthine oxidase (XO) warfarin plus vitamin K for CYP2C9 omeprazole for CYP 2C19 dextromethorphan for CYP2D6 and midazolam for CYP3A4/5. This combination of probes has been validated in the Cooperstown 5+1 Cocktail (5+1).1 The use of the 5+1 cocktail provides information on the drug metabolizing enzymes that metabolize 90% of hepatically eliminated drugs for a fraction of the costs of the individual studies. Using a cocktail of biomarkers reduces the overall cost of drug interaction screening. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of three Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved oral antibiotics (azithromycin telithromycin and levofloxacin) on metabolism of other medications when taken together. This will be determined by the measuring the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes following administration of certain drug probes (caffeine dextromethorphan omeprazole midazolam and warfarin with vitamin K). A total of 16 subjects will complete four phases of the study: 1) Cooperstown 5+1 alone 2) Azithromycin plus Cooperstown 5+1 3) Telithromycin plus Cooperstown 5+1 and 4) Levofloxacin plus Cooperstown 5+1.    ,NCT00164112

Healthy,Posturing Effects on Perception of Time and Perceptions of the Provider-Patient Interaction in the Emergency Department, Study Objective:   -  To examine the perceptions of time spent at the bedside; perceptions of bedside manner; and patient perceptions of the provider-patient interaction offered by emergency providers when they sit versus when they stand during the initial evaluation. This project is clinically relevant research different from prior Emergency Department (ED) satisfaction studies since this study will contribute information about factors that could increase patient satisfaction with his/her provider in the ED setting. This research may guide specific guidelines for quality improvement efforts. The investigators hypothesize that patients will perceive that the emergency providers are at the bedside longer demonstrate better bedside manner and have better provider-patient interactions when they sit versus when they stand. Additionally the investigators hypothesize that providers who sit will perceive that they are at the bedside longer than those who stand for the same period of time. Methods: A convenience sample of adult patients will complete a 5-item questionnaire concerning the perceived time spent with the emergency provider and the qualities of the provider-patient interaction. Emergency providers will be randomly assigned to either sit or stand during the initial evaluation. The providers will complete a 4-item questionnaire. These data will be compared to the actual time spent in the evaluation measured in seconds using a stopwatch. These data combined with demographic data obtained from the patient chart will be analyzed to examine whether there are statistically significant differences in patient perceptions and satisfaction.    ,NCT00170105
Healthy,Effect of Branched Chain Amino Acids on Muscle, With aging there is a decrease in muscle mass and function especially in the energy storehouses of cells called mitochondria. Amino acids the building blocks of protein and insulin have been shown to increase muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis and thereby function.

Healthy,Observation and Evaluation of Chewing Velocity Changes on Soft Food Chewing Efficiency, Soft food chewing does not require strong bite force. The number of chewing strokes and occlusal surface area of the posterior teeth are more important. Clinically reduction of occlusal surface to protect the abutments of a fixed or removable partial denture or the implant supported teeth is often necessary. If a certain chewing ability is maintained with reduced occlusal area changing chewing velocity might help. For this hypothesis the effect of chewing velocity on soft food chewing ability would be observed first. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the deliberately changed chewing gum chewing velocity on the chewing ability of healthy subjects whose dental occlusal surface area is known. Twenty dental students (10 men and 10 women with an age range of 20-30 years) with healthy masticatory systems and complete dentition will be asked to chew HA containing chewing gum with habitual side teeth at the cycle time of 0.5 sec 1.0 sec and 1.5 sec for 30 40 and 50 times. Jaw movement tooth contact and muscle activities will be observed during chewing gum chewing. The distribution of HA particles in the gum bolus after each chewing session will be measured and regarded as the chewing efficiency of that subject. Occlusal surface area of the maxillary posterior teeth chewing rate chewing time muscle activity and jaw lateral displacement will be related to the chewing efficiency with multiple regression analysis. The effects of practice due to changing of chewing rate will also be evaluated.    ,NCT00172692

Healthy,Induction of Cytokines in Human Monocytes by SARS-CoV in Adults and Children, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new emerging infectious disease. Its pathogen is a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The clinical course can be classified to 3 stages: viral replication phase hyperimmune reactive phase and pulmonary destruction phase. Human monocyte plays a critical role in the initiation of immune response in defending the intracellular pathogens (eg viruses). Monocytes can engulf viruses and present the viral antigens in the major histocompatibility (MHC) molecule to the cell surface to initiate T lymphocyte response. Monocytes also secrete various cytokines to modulate immune response. SARS-CoV is a mutant of animal virus to cause human disease and is able to cause unusual severe respiratory illness. It is suggested the unusual severe disease is due to the intense immune reaction. The investigators will harvest human monocytes from healthy adult and children blood donors. Monocytes would be cultured and infected by SARS-CoV. The change of viral load is monitored after infection. Cytokines secreted by monocytes after infection are also measured. The difference of monocyte cytokine secretion is compared between adults and children. The study is to verify the SARS-CoV infectivity of human monocytes and prove the unusual severity caused by SARS-CoV is related to viral-induced dysregulation of cytokine responses. The results may also clarify why adults tend to have a more severe illness compared with children.    ,NCT00173563

Healthy,Influence of Intestinal Transporter Genetic Variants on the Bioavailability of Gabapentin, The current study is part of a large multi-investigator grant to look at the pharmacogenetics of a number of membrane transporters. Previously we have recruited a cohort of healthy volunteers (Studies of Pharmacogenetics in Ethnically-diverse Populations or SOPHIE) and have resequenced the coding region of a number of membrane transporter genes to identify genetic polymorphisms in these genes. We plan to take a genotype-to-phenotype approach to study the influence of specific polymorphisms in the intestinal transporters such as the novel organic cation transporters 1 and 2 (OCTN1 and OCTN2) genes on the bioavailability of gabapentin in healthy subjects. Eligible subjects will have a single inpatient study visit during which they will take a single dose of gabapentin and provide blood and urine samples over the course of 36 hours (5 terminal elimination gabapentin half-lives) for pharmacokinetic analysis.    ,NCT00187707

Healthy,Evaluation of TEACH (Training Early Achievers for Careers in Health) Research, The conceptual framework underlying the TEACH Research Program is based on a specific theoretical approach designed to influence adolescent career choice in this case towards a career in clinical research. The factors responsible for influencing career choice that form the foundation for our investigation are: 1) the importance of role models in career choice; 2) acquisition of knowledge in order to align ambitions; and 3) the participation of students in activities that actively challenge and engage them. These three factors are addressed by the following three components of the TEACH Research Intervention: 1) participation in a research team consisting of a multi-tiered structure of mentors; 2) classroom instruction of clinical research knowledge and career strategies; and 3) a hands-on clinical research experience through an internship on the Hospitalist Project. The evaluation of TEACH Research (Teaching Early Achievers for Careers in Health) aims to rigorously evaluate a precollege enrichment program in clinical research targeting high school students particularly underrepresented minorities in order to increase the entry and success of these students into careers in clinical research. Through these measures the TEACH Research Program will educate high achieving minority students and in turn hopefully encourage and promote these students to think about a career in clinical research.    ,NCT00204035

Healthy,Dietary Effects of Sulfur Amino Acids, The purpose of this study is to determine the level of sulfur amino acids in the diet that is needed to maintaining glutathione antioxidant status. This information could prove very useful in medicine because it could allow identification of an optimal diet for control of antioxidant levels. This diet could be used in conjunction with other therapies in order to prevent or delay oxidative stress and any diseases that may result from this. Total study participation will include a screening visit and a 14-day study period where dietary intake of sulfur amino acids will be controlled. We aim to enroll 12 normal subjects at Emory University Hospital.The primary hypothesis is that steady-state GSH/GSSG and CYS/CYSS redox in human plasma will become oxidized due to SAA intake at 0% of the RDA and reduced due to SAA intake at 3X the RDA.    ,NCT00228618
Healthy,Effect of Sulfur Amino Acid Depletion and Acetaminophen on Plasma Glutatione, Availability of sulfur amino acids (SAA) is critical for glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) and cysteine/cystine (CYS/CYSS) redox in vivo and for many other physiologic functions including protein synthesis nitrogen balance digestion osmotic regulation detoxification hormonal regulation biologic methylations and cell growth regulation. GSH conjugation and sulfate conjugation represent quantitatively important pathways for chemical detoxification which imposes substantial burden upon SAA supply. The primary hypothesis is that SAA deficient diet and acetaminophen (APAP) administration will perturb Cys metabolism and GSH redox homeostasis in human plasma and urinary output of SAA metabolites. Because both of these variations affect SAA homeostasis it is believed that the combination of these treatments will produce an interactive effect in which 2-day SAA deficiency will alter APAP metabolism APAP will affect SAA homeostasis and the treatments together will alter the global metabolic profile as measured by 1H-NMR spectroscopy.    ,NCT00228644

Healthy,The Efficacy and Safety of Gantacurium Chloride for Injection in Tracheal Intubation in Healthy Adult Patients Undergoing Surgery Under General Anesthesia, This is a multicenter randomized controlled observer-blinded dose-response study to evaluate the efficacy in tracheal intubation and safety of gantacurium chloride for injection in healthy adult patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. Gantacurium chloride for injection (previously referred to as AV430A) is a new investigational non-depolarizing ultra-short acting neuromuscular blocking agent (NMB). Preliminary results in animals and healthy human subjects (Phase 1 studies in adult volunteers) suggest that gantacurium chloride for injection may provide a useful adjunct to general anesthesia by permitting rapid intubation. This Phase 2 study will provide more definitive information on the ultra-short acting profile of the compound by determining the quality of intubation in patients at 60 seconds as assessed by a blinded intubator. In addition the safety of the compound will be assessed. In this study the efficacy and safety of gantacurium chloride for injection will also be compared to a reference drug succinylcholine and to placebo.

Healthy,Can Erythropoietin Protect the Cerebral Blood Flow and Oxygenation During Simulated Dive?," During facial cooling and especially during breath hold can mammals - and also humans - elicit a so called dive reflex causing bradycardia peripheral vasoconstriction and centralization of blood flow to brain lungs and heart but the reflex is suppressed by physical activity. The dive reflex can be elicited by breath hold alone and will be more pronounced during simultaneously facial cooling but not by stimulation of other skin receptors. The dive reflex has an oxygen conserving effect because of intense vasoconstriction in both viscera and muscles and simultaneously with reduction in cardiac output (CO). Therefore plasma lactate will rise to compensate for the lesser regional blood flow. If one hyperventilates with 100 % oxygen then the reflex can still be elicited but it is more pronounced during asphyxia. Experienced sports divers who has been diving for more than 7-10 years have reduced post apnea acidosis and oxidational stress but probably also less sensitivity for progressive hypoxia and hypercapnia because these individuals have a more pronounced dive reflex. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) gives a reproducibly value for brain perfusion by continuously non-invasive real-time sampling. A single piezo-electrical transducer sends and collects ultrasound through the temporal region of the scull where it is the thinnest. Hereby can the blood flow of arteria cerebri anterior media (MCA) and posterior and basilaris be estimated. With TCD it can be shown that the cerebral blood flow rises in MCA in healthy subjects during facial cooling with normal ventilation when resting in a supine position without affecting the systemic blood pressure. Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT)-scanning during normo-baric and hyperbaric pressure of professional divers breathing 100 % oxygen has shown to reduce the cerebral blood flow in several regions of the brain. But it is yet unknown how brain blood flow and metabolism are affected by an ""face immersion dive"" and simultaneously prolonged physical activity and hence a rise in lactate under hyperbaric pressure (3 meters) breathing atmospheric air similar to the circumstances for trained scuba divers work. Presumably it will cause a fall in brain blood flow and in time cognitive deficits. Erythropoietin (rhEPO) is a well known drug used as doping in sports for about 15 years. So far the only known enhancement in athletic achievement by rhEPO is caused by peripheral improvements and especially blood capability to transport oxygen to the working muscles; this has been documented by a rise in haematocrit. rhEPO has also a neuroprotective effect on neurons in patients with neuron damage caused by cerebral hypoxic ischeamia. rhEPO work also on a series of cerebral mechanisms including enhanced motor and spatial learning and more. Enhanced motor learning may improve the professional divers choices during work and may be also physical performance and mechanical efficiency. Intravenous injection of rhEPO will increase rhEPO in cerebrospinal fluids since rhEPO is capable of crossing blood brain. All together this may indicate that rhEPO not only works on physical performance but also has effects on the brain. rhEPO has also an effect on the condition of cancer and dialysis patients not only explained by merely increased hematocrit. This project will add new knowledge in the understanding of the mechanisms of clinical use of rhEPO. The purpose of this study is to investigate how brain blood flow and metabolism are affected by face immersion dive and simultaneously breath hold during normo-baric and hyperbaric pressure (3 m depth) when breathing atmospheric air in trained sports divers. IL-6 HSP-72 lactate ammonium and body-temperature will be measured. Brain and muscle oxygenation will be measured by near-infrared spectroscopi (NIRS). Furthermore we will investigate whether a small dose of rhEPO affects mentioned parameters during simulated dive in pressure chamber with facial cooling. Hypothesis Brain blood flow in trained divers will be diminished during prolonged physical activity during simultaneously face immersion dive and breath hold under hyperbaric pressure. There will be a release of IL-6 and HSP-72. Pretreatment with a small amount of rhEPO before prolonged physical activity during simulated dive has a protective effect on brain blood flow and oxygenation.    ",NCT00265486

Healthy,Dietary Variety Versus Dietary Fat Effects in Energy Intake, The relative importance of dietary patterns vs. macronutrient composition in affecting energy intake and body weight remains uncertain. In this study we propose to investigate the relative effects of dietary variety vs dietary fat on voluntary energy intake in adults. We will quantify and compare the effects of typical ranges of variety & fat intakes in the American diet on voluntary energy intake. The primary hypotheses to be tested are 1)an increasing availability of entree/side/snack/dessert variety offered will significantly increase voluntary energy intake in a dose-response fashion when other dietary factors known to influence energy intake are held constant. 2)The separate effects of dietary variety & dietary fat on energy intake will be similar. We anticipate that the results of this investigation will lead to a greater understanding of the relative importance of eating patterns versus macronutrient composition in the etiology of obesity and more specifically dietary variety versus dietary fat in determining energy intake. More importantly it will help lay a foundation for improved dietary recommendations concerning weight loss and prevention of excess weight gain in adulthood.    ,NCT00285571
Healthy,Effects of Divalproex Sodium on Food Intake Energy Expenditure and Posture Allocation, The purpose of the proposed study is to identify the mechanisms responsible for the weight gain associated with Depakote treatment and to identify methods to prevent and treat weight gain in people taking Depakote. Both sides of the energy balance equation will be measured in a sample of healthy lean and overweight adults. Energy intake will be measured in the Pennington Center's Eating Laboratory and total daily energy expenditure (TEE) and posture allocation will be measured with the IDEEA?? Questionnaires that assess food cravings and eating attitudes and behaviors will be used to determine if a behavioral phenotype is associated with weight gain in response to Depakote treatment. It is hypothesized that Depakote treatment will result in increased food intake. It is also hypothesized that the time spent engaging in sedentary behavior will increase in response to Depakote treatment. Time spent engaging in and the energy expended during physical activity is expected to decrease significantly. Therefore it is hypothesized that TEE is expected to decrease significantly. The results will be used to identify specific behavioral targets to prevent weight gain during treatment with Depakote. Potential targets include interventions to modify food intake and physical activity. The degree to which each behavior (food intake or physical activity) will be targeted is dependent on the results of this study. For instance if the majority of the weight gain associated with Depakote treatment is due to changes in food intake stronger dietary interventions will be suggested. Additionally changes in endocrine factors (hormones and peptides) will be evaluated during the study to determine if Depakote is associated with an altered endocrine response that affects satiety food intake or energy expenditure. If an altered endocrine response is found these results will be used to identify adjunctive medications or compounds to correct the endocrine response and reduce weight gain. Genomic studies will also be possible since gene sequencing and gene expression can be analyzed from archived buffy coat samples.    ,NCT00287053

Healthy,Study Examining Repeat Dosing of OROS® Methylphenidate (CONCERTA®) and Immediate Release Methylphenidate in Healthy Adults, There are two specific aims of this study. The first is to document the pharmacokinetics of dopamine transporter (DAT) receptor occupancy of repeated administration of orally administered therapeutic doses of a short immediate release-methylphenidate hydrochloride (IR-MPH) and a long-acting formulation of MPH (OROS-MPH) using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with C-11 altropane as the ligand. The investigators hypothesize that central nervous system (CNS) DAT occupancy of the OROS-MPH to IR-MPH sequence will be greater than that of IR-MPH to OROS-MPH sequence at 5 hours after the initial administration and that the CNS DAT occupancy of the other two formulations will be intermediate. The second aim of this study is to assess whether the abuse liability potential of delayed repeated administrations of different formulations of MPH is moderated by the oral delivery system in which a delivery system with slower onset may be safer than one with more rapid early release.    ,NCT00302393
Healthy,A Study of Repeat Dosing of OROS® Methylphenidate Hydrochloride (CONCERTA®) and Immediate Release Methylphenidate Hydrochloride in Healthy Adults, This is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled five-period crossover study to examine the likability of a repeated administration of immediate release methylphenidate hydrochloride (IR-MPH 40 mg) and OROS®-MPH (CONCERTA® 72 mg) in healthy adults. Hypotheses are as follows:   -  Hypothesis 1: the subjective feelings of detection and likeability will be greater for periods of IR-MPH administration than after OROS-MPH administration irregardless of sequence;   -  Hypothesis 2: the greater ratings of feelings of detection and likeability will be associated with the periods of most rapid change in plasma d-MPH and not with the magnitude of plasma d-MPH concentration (other than the OROS-MPH to IR-MPH condition in which they coincide) and   -  Hypothesis 3: the subjective feelings of dislike will be greatest for the two conditions in which IR-MPH is the second condition.    ,NCT00302458

Healthy,Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Pediatric Normal Volunteers, This study will examine ways to establish and standardize normal measurements for children specific to gender age and body surface when using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI which was introduced in the 1980s is being used more frequently for children. In this study researchers seek to understand how a child's heart is different from that of an adult when an MRI is used for tests. More children with congenital heart disease are living longer. Researchers are looking for a better way to assess their cardiac anatomy and function and to compare findings with normal function. Patients ages 8 to 21 in good health and who do not smoke may be eligible for this study. There will be a blood or urine test to check for pregnancy in female volunteers who have begun menstruating or who are over age 12. Pregnancy test results must be negative for those patients to stay in the study. The MRI technique uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. For that procedure patients will lie still on a table that slides into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will be in the scanner from 20 to 60 minutes. As the scanner takes pictures patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds and they will wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan. At any time patients or their parents may ask that the patients be moved out of the machine. If they would like patients can bring a music CD or listen to a radio station through headphones. Some MRI techniques require monitoring while the patient is undergoing the scan. For monitoring of the heart an electrocardiogram (EKG) will be performed to make sure that the heart rhythm is normal and that heart disease is not present. Patients may be asked to wear adhesive patches that are attached to wires of the EKG machine on their chests. To monitor breathing patients may be asked to wear a rubber belt that stretches as they take a breath. So that the best quality images are produced patients may be asked to hold their breath for about 15 seconds. During the MRI scan patients may experience peripheral nerve stimulation usually experienced as a muscle twitch. It is caused by rapid switching of magnetic fields and is not serious. Patients who feel a muscle twitch should report that sensation to the person performing the scan. It is possible though unlikely for a painful sensation to result from nerve stimulation. Patients should immediately report if they have pain so that the scan can be stopped.    ,NCT00353899

Healthy,Role of the Brain in Processing Visually Presented Objects, This study will examine the parts of the brain that use visual information to perform movements. Patients with certain brain lesions tend to have difficulty in processing visually presented objects. This study will look at the brain mechanisms underlying the visuo-motor integration. Healthy normal volunteers between 20 and 60 years of age are eligible for this study. People who have had a severe head injury with loss of consciousness or any other mental or neurological disorder diagnosed by a doctor may not participate. Candidates will be screened with a medical history a physical examination focusing on finger movements and a questionnaire. Participants' brain activity will be recorded using two techniques - magnetoencephalography(MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - while they watch pictures of various objects flashed on a screen. MEG is a procedure to record magnetic field changes produced by brain activity. During the recording the subject sits comfortably in an armchair in a dimly lit room and watches pictures presented on a screen. About 50 pictures are shown per session. There are about five sessions separated by 3-minute breaks. Functional MRI involves taking pictures of the brain using MRI while the subject performs a task. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. The subject lies still on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner. During the scan he or she looks at pictures in six test blocks of 1 minute each with 30-second breaks between blocks.    ,NCT00357695

Healthy,SSRI Effects on Semen Parameters in Men, According to the National Institute of Mental Health depressive disorders afflict over six million U.S. men annually. Most cases of moderate or severe depression are treated with antidepressants including monoamine oxidase inhibitors tricyclic antidepressants and more recently selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and antidepressants with modest serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition but unknown mechanism-of-action. Over the past two years prescribing data show a steady increase in antidepressant dispensing rates (especially including serotonin reuptake inhibitors) for adults. SSRIs are known to have an effect on ejaculatory function and are therapeutically used for treatment of premature (rapid) ejaculation. However few studies have evaluated the potential impact of antidepressant medications on male fertility and no studies have been published with respect to the impact of newer antidepressants such as SSRIs on male fertility. In the high-volume male infertility practice at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center several patients have presented who have had a clear temporal association between SSRI use and impairment in sperm motility and/or sperm transport (emission). These men have shown improvement in sperm counts and motility after discontinuation of antidepressant medications. We propose a crossover pilot study of normal healthy males to ascertain possible effects of SSRIs on semen parameters. After initial screening semen analyses subjects will take the SSRI paroxetine for five weeks. Serial semen analyses will be obtained while on medication and one month after discontinuation of medication. Comparisons between semen parameters on and off medication will be used to evaluate the frequency and significance of semen analysis changes during SSRI treatment.    ,NCT00385762

Healthy,Enhancing Brain Activity With Magnetic Stimulation," This study will determine whether stimulation of the right side of the brain with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) followed by stimulation of the left side with theta burst stimulation (TBS) can temporarily change brain activity and improve hand movements in subjects more than has recently been achieved with rTMS alone. For rTMS a wire coil is held on the patient's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in the muscles of the face arm or leg. The subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk electrodes taped to the skin of the arms or legs. This study uses two kinds of rTMS. In one (Hz rTMS) magnetic pulses are given once per second for a period of 20 minutes; in the other (TBS) a series of pulses are given in bursts each lasting 2 seconds for a period of 3 minutes. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures during three visits to the NIH Clinical Center: Visit 1: Participants receive either real or sham rTMS applied on the right side of the brain followed by real or sham TBS applied on the left side of the brain. In addition subjects undergo the following: "" Pinch force: Subjects press a wedged instrument between the thumb and index finger as hard as they can during several trials every 10 seconds. "" Speed tapping: Subjects press a key on a computer keyboard as quickly as possible for 10 seconds repeated for several trials. "" Simple reaction time: Subjects respond as quickly as possible to a ""go"" signal presented on a computer monitor by performing a quick wrist movement. "" Electromyography: Subjects' muscle activity is recorded using electrodes (small metal disks) filled with conductive gel and taped to the skin over the muscle. Visits 2 and 3 Visit 2 is scheduled for one day after visit 1 and visit 3 is one week after visit 1. Participants do not have brain stimulation during these two visits but they have TMS measurements behavioral measurements and electromyography (EMG) to see if the brain stimulation done during the first visit is still present after a period of time.

Healthy,Effects of Peptides Derived From Fermented Milk on Blood Pressure Regulation System in Healthy Volunteers., Several milk proteins are precursors of peptides released during fermentation which possess various biochemical and physiological properties. Among them some peptides have been reported to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro (an enzyme implicated in blood pressure regulation) and to lower blood pressure (BP). in hypertensive rats and in a small sample of patients with hypertension. One possible mechanism for the BP lowering effect is inhibition of ACE. Prior investigating BP lowering effect of these peptides in a large cohort of hypertensive patients it is necessary to assess in depth their potency to inhibit ACE in vivo in humans and to compare it to that induced by a well-known ACE inhibitor.    ,NCT00399737

Healthy,The Effect of Vitamin K Supplementation on Osteocalcin Carboxylation in Healthy Children, Background of the study: Results from several studies show that vitamin K has an important function in bone metabolism. In a previous cross-sectional study conducted by our department evidence for a poor vitamin K status of bone during growth in children was found (unpublished data accepted for publication Pediatric Research october 2006). These findings justify clinical intervention studies in which bone quality is monitored as a function of long-term vitamin K-supplementation. Before a long-term intervention study is undertaken it is important to determine the effect of vitamin K administration on osteocalcin carboxylation in this specific population. Although the relationship between increased vitamin K intake and osteocalcin carboxylation was already clearly demonstrated in several adult groups (e.g. healthy adults postmenopausal women) this has never been shown in children. Objective of the study: To study the effect of a vitamin K-containing food supplement (menaquinone 7) on osteocalcin carboxylation in healthy children between 6 and 10 years of age in the Netherlands. Study design: Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled intervention study. Study population: 55 healthy children (boys and girls) between 6 and 10 years recruited from primary schools. Intervention: The subjects are randomised into two groups:   -  placebo group: during 8 weeks 27 children will receive one tablet of placebo- food supplement per day   -  treatment group: during 8 weeks 28 children will receive one tablet of food supplement per day containing 45 µg vitamin K2. Primary study parameters/outcome of the study: Undercarboxylated (ucOC) and carboxylated (cOC) fractions of osteocalcin will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Both the ucOC fraction and the ucOC/cOC ratio (UCR) are sensitive indicators for the vitamin K status of bone. Elevated levels of UCR are indicative of an inferior vitamin K status of bone. The main study parameters are the mean percentages of change in serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) and UCR from baseline (t=0) to endpoint (t=8 weeks) in both treatment groups. Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable): The secondary end points are the percentages of change in serum vitamin K levels in relation to lipid metabolism markers from baseline to endpoint in each individual. Furthermore the percentages of changes in serum BAP and NTX from baseline to endpoint in each individual are considered to be endpoints as well.    ,NCT00402974
Healthy,Effect of Oxygen Breathing on Flicker Induced Blood Flow Changes in the Optic Nerve Head, Background It has recently been shown that diffuse luminance flicker increases retinal and optic nerve head blood flow. This indicates that a neuro-vascular coupling between neural activity and blood flow exists as described previously for the brain. Although a lot of mediators such as NO pO2 pCO2 H+ and K+ have been proposed the mechanism of this coupling is still a matter of controversy. However it has been shown in an animal experiment that an increase in blood flow evoked by diffuse luminance flicker stimulation is paralleled by an decrease in pO2 in the tissue. Thus in this study we set out to investigate the flicker light induced increase in blood flow under elevated blood pO2. Study rationale The motive for the investigation of retinal blood flow regulation is to enhance our understanding of the coupling mechanism between increased neural activity and blood flow in the retina in order to gain new insight in the pathophysiology of several eye diseases associated with ocular vascular disorders Study objectives To test the hypothesis whether oxygen breathing influences flicker light induced changes in optic nerve head blood flow    ,NCT00406224

Informed consent was obtained prior to screening. All screening assessments establishing subject eligibility were performed in the 21 days before dosing. Randomization Pre-dose on Day 1 subjects were randomized to one of the two treatment sequences: Sequence 1: SC Saizen administered by the Standard needle and syringe (Period 1) followed by the administration using the ATS-1 device (Period 2). Sequence 2: SC Saizen administered by the ATS-1 device (Period 1) followed by administration using the standard needle and syringe (Period 2). Subjects were resident at the Unit from approximately 19:00 on Day -1 until Day 2 (approximately 30 hours (h) post dose) of each treatment period. An IV Stilamin infusion was commenced 1 h before. Saizen administration and stopped immediately after the last pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sample has been taken i.e. a 25 h infusion. Stilamin was administered as a constant IV infusion at a rate of approximately 118 mg/h (40 mL/h) which corresponds to 1.65 mg/kg body weight/h for a person weighing 70kg. Dosing with Saizen occurred between approximately 0800 and 0900 h on Day 1 of each treatment period after an overnight fast of at least 10h. Subjects were dosed with Saizen at the same time on Day 1 in Periods 1 and 2. There was a minimum of 7-day washout between treatment periods 1 and 2.

Healthy,Effects of tDCS Over the Cerebellum on Motor Function, This study will evaluate whether applying electrical stimulation on the cerebellum (posterior and lower part of the brain) can influence brain excitability and hand movement performance. A new technique became available to stimulate the brain: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) which could improve the ability to learn. Researchers do not know whether applying tDCS over the cerebellum could also influence motor function and they want to examine changes in brain excitability by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Patients ages 18 to 40 who are not pregnant may be eligible for this study. They will come to NIH for a medical history and completing a questionnaire about memory and attention. There will be five experiments each up to 5 hours for about 1 to 5 weeks in which patients perform tasks like pinching a special device between the thumb and index fingers or reaching for target objects on the computer screen. Patients will receive mild electrical stimulation over a different part of the head each day. Some experiments are done without the electrical current but patients will not know which ones are with or without stimulation. There are also short questionnaires about attention fatigue and mood to be completed before during and after each experiment. Patients will be connected to an electromyography (EMG) machine to measure electrical activity of muscles. Electrodes are taped to the skin over one small hand muscle. TMS allows electrical pulses to pass through the brain to stimulate it. TMS is used at the beginning of each experiment to determine the precise location on the scalp of two target areas: cerebellum and motor cortex. TMS is a safe procedure. Discomfort headache or nausea can occur but all symptoms usually go away promptly. During motor learning under tDCS also a safe procedure patients sit in a comfortable chair and the arm and wrist and arm are kept still. Sponge electrodes are applied on the chin back of the head neck collarbone lateral part of the head or above the eyebrow. A small electrical current is passed between electrodes. Patients may feel an itching or tingling sensation under the electrodes or see slight light flashes. tDCS is applied for 20 to 30 minutes. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan which may also be involved uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. Patients lie on a table in a cylinder and may be asked to lie still for up to 60 minutes at a time. This study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However knowledge gained may help researchers identify ways to improve movement in people with a brain injury such as chronic stroke.    ,NCT00413842

Healthy,Detecting a Reward Signal in the Motor Cortex, This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to determine whether the activity in the brain when someone wins something affects the part of the brain that controls movement. Studies have shown that the brain releases signals to mark rewards for certain behavior like the activity the brain generates when an animal receives food or drink after performing a certain action. This study will look for a way to detect this kind of signal in humans. Healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age are eligible for this study. Participants undergo TMS during two experiments slot machine stimulation and key sequence (see below). For TMS a wire coil is held on the subject s scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The stimulation may cause twitching in muscles of the face arm or leg and there may be a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk electrodes taped onto the skin of the arms or legs. The stimulation strength needed to activate the hand muscles is determined at the beginning of each experiment. To do this the subject sits with his or her arms and hand relaxed. Magnetic pulses of varying strengths are applied in order to find the right strength. Also a series of 45 pairs of magnetic pulses is administered so close to each other that they produce only one movement. Measurements of the movements generated serve as a baseline for comparison with movements generated during the experiments. Slot Machine Simulation Subjects play a computer game similar to a slot machine. They press a button to start the game and watch as three barrels of the machine spin into place. Subjects can win $0.25 $1or $5 if all three barrels match when they stop spinning. If all three barrels do not match subjects do not win any money except in rare instances when they are awarded money even when all three barrels do not match. In one trial in this experiment subjects receive transcranial magnetic stimulation after they see the second barrel stop spinning. In another trial they receive the stimulation after the third barrel stops spinning. Key Sequence Subjects see a letter on a computer screen and press a combination of the three keyboard keys G H and J. If they press the keys in the right order and under the time limit they win $1. At some point the letter displayed changes and the subjects must guess a new combination to earn money. Each of the letters corresponds to its own combination of key presses. A few moments after the subjects see whether they pressed the keys in the right order they receive TMS.    ,NCT00422071

Healthy,Gas Supply Demand and Middle Ear Gas Balance: Specific Aim 3c, This study will determine if gas can pass between the environment and the middle ear by way of the eardrum. This route of gas exchange was observed in animals but has not been studied in humans. If gas exchange across the eardrum is documented and the rate is sufficiently high this can help explain certain past observations such as why middle ear pressure does not change very much in some children and adults when they have a cold or flu. The investigators also expect that the rate of gas exchange across the eardrum will depend on whether or not the eardrum has scarred or abnormally thin regions.    ,NCT00422851
Healthy,Direct Current Brain Polarization of the Frontal Lobes, This study will explore what effects if any direct current (DC) brain polarization may produce on mental processes such as attention reaction time working memory speed of information processing and mood or emotional states. In DC brain polarization a very weak electrical current is applied to the head. This technique has been used for many years on patients and healthy people with no known serious side effects. Studies have shown that DC polarization can temporarily improve people's ability to think of certain words. To determine if DC polarization can be used as a treatment for certain types of brain disorders its possible effects on mood and other mental abilities must be determined. Healthy normal volunteers over age 18 may be eligible for this study. In each of three 1.5-hour sessions scheduled a day apart participants complete the tasks listed below to determine the effects of polarization. For each session electrodes are placed on the head arm and hand. One set of electrodes is for brain stimulation; the second set is used to measure the amount of skin moisture on the hand. The participants' tasks are to:   -  Push a button on a keyboard when they see a specific item.   -  Circle a number or make a mark on a line to indicate how much they feel a particular emotion or sensation at that time.   -  Answer questions about themselves or their opinions on certain topics.   -  Look at several pictures and say how emotional they think they are.   -  Read about an imaginary situation and say what they would do in that situation.   -  Choose between decks of cards to try to win money.   -  Compare the angles of lines.   -  Identify smells using a scratch and sniff test.   -  At the end of the session say how they are feeling. Participants are called by phone on the day after each session to see how they are feeling.    ,NCT00424216

Healthy,Safety/Efficacy Trial of Killed Leishmania Vaccine in Volunteers With no Response to Leishmanin, Development of a safe and effective vaccine against leishmaniasis started more than 10 years ago under WHO/TDR supervision. An autoclaved L. major vaccine (ALM) mixed with BCG has been tested in human in Iran Pakistan and Sudan. Long term follow up of the vaccinees showed no untoward reactions except the skin reaction at the site of injection. The efficacy results of ALM was not satisfactory. In order to enhance immunogenicity of the vaccine ALM was adsorbed to alum (Aluminum hydroxide). Alum-ALM plus adjuvant showed to induce protection in Rhesus monkeys against cutaneous leishmaniasis and in Languor monkeys against visceral leishmaniasis. Two trials of a single injection of different doses of Alum-ALM mixed with 1/10th of normal dose of BCG was carried out in healthy volunteers from a non endemic area of Sudan. The safety/immunogenicity parameters of the volunteers were closely monitored and the results showed that side effects were minimal and confined to the site of injection in the form of mild local pain induration and ulceration all associated with BCG vaccination. The immunogenicity results showed the strongest immune response seen in any Leishmania vaccine trials so far. It seems that this new formulation is an appropriate candidate for further development. Inoculation with live virulent Leishmania to produce a lesion for the purpose of preventing natural infection is known as leishmanization. The induced lesion heals and the person is usually protected against further infections. This method of prevention was practiced for centuries in the region. In this study volunteers with no response to leishmanin will be injected twice (30 days apart) with Alum-ALM 200 ug + 1/10 of BCG (n = 50) or BCG (n = 50) or BCG diluent alone (n = 50) as control. All volunteers will be leishmanized on day 60 post vaccination. In this trial volunteers are protected either by vaccine or by leishmanization. The leishmanized volunteers will be visited by weekly and the development and healing process of the lesion will be monitored until complete healing of every volunteer. The immune responses of the volunteers will be evaluated. Vaccine efficacy is defined by the percent reduction in the number of volunteers developing a lesion following leishmanization as compared to controls on days 240.    ,NCT00429715

Healthy,The Validity of Retinal Blood Flow Measurements During Hyperoxia in Humans Using Fourier Domain Color Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography (CDOCT), Noninvasive monitoring of blood flow in retinal circulation may elucidate the progression and treatment of ocular disorders including diabetic retinopathy age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) a noninvasive optical method combined with vessel size determination has been used extensively as a valuable research tool to examine blood flow dynamics in the human retina. However no information on the velocity profile within the vessel is available. Ophthalmic color Doppler optical coherence tomography (CDOCT) provides laser Doppler information in addition to conventional optical coherence tomography allowing the observation of blood flow dynamics simultaneously to imaging retinal structure. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of Fourier domain CDOCT to assess velocity profiles in human retinal vessels in vivo. In the present study the validity of Fourier domain CDOCT for retinal blood flow measurements will be tested at baseline and during hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction in humans by comparison with retinal blood flow measurements using a commercially available LDV system and the Zeiss retinal vessel analyzer (RVA)    ,NCT00431600

Healthy,To Study the Peripheral Effect of Botulinum Toxin-A (Botox-A) on Experimentally Induced Cutaneous Pain in Healthy Subjects, This is a human trial to study the peripheral effect of therapeutic botulinum toxin (botox-A). The trial is performed on healthy normal males. The study comprises of two parallel placebo-controlled double blinded studies. In experiment 1 intramuscular Botox will be given in corrugator (one site) and frontalis (two sites) muscles on one side and placebo to the other side. Intradermal (i.d.) capsaicin injection will be given to both sides (between the two sites of frontalis injection horizontally). Capsaicin-induced pain intensity and flare together with the area of hypersensitivity to different stimulus modalities will be measured and mapped at specific time points using different cutaneous stimuli (thermal electrical tactile pressure). This will characterize which fibres and receptors are affected by Botox and will show if Botox have a unilateral effect (peripheral) or if it also affects the contralateral side (central effect). In experiment 2 intradermal Botox will be given in corrugator (one site) and frontalis (two sites) muscles on one side and placebo to the other side. I.d. capsaicin injection will be given to both sides (between the two sites of frontalis injection horizontally). Capsaicin-induced pain intensity and flare together with the area of hypersensitivity to different stimulus modalities will be measured and mapped at specific time points using different cutaneous stimuli (thermal electrical tactile pressure). This will characterize which fibres and receptors are affected by Botox. The effect of intradermal Botox will be compared to the results of experiment 1. The two experiments will show if the intramuscular Botox exerts its action via a leak of Botox from the muscle to the overlying skin. Antipruritic effects of Botox on histamine prick test and itch will also be assessed in parallel with the experiment 2. In this sub-experiment 5 Units of Botox will be injected intradermally in the middle of volar forearm. The same volume of placebo will be injected into the other side. Histamine prick test will induce itch and the effect of intradermal Botox will be assessed compared to the baseline. Flare area and visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings will be measured.    ,NCT00435682

Healthy,Imaging of Cannabinoid Receptors Using New Radioactive Tracer, This study will test a new radioactive tracer [(11)C]MePPEP for use in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The tracer is used to visualize cannabinoid receptors proteins in the brain that mediate a variety of natural chemicals. These receptors may be important in behavioral diseases such as addiction obesity and psychiatric diseases. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Ten participants undergo whole body PET imaging to determine where the [(11)C]MePPEP tracer is distributed in the body in order to calculate radiation exposure from the tracer. Another 10 subjects undergo brain imaging with [(11)C]MePPEP to measure cannabinoid receptors in the brain. All participants are evaluated with a medical history and physical examination blood and urine tests and an electrocardiogram (ECG) before scanning. They then have a PET scan. For this procedure a catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the arm through which the tracer is injected. A special mask is fitted to the head and attached to the bed to help keep the head in place during the scan. Subjects undergoing brain imaging also have a catheter placed in an artery in the wrist from which blood samples are collected during the procedure. The scan lasts about 2 to 2.5 hours. Subjects undergoing brain imaging also have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 1 year of the PET scan. For MRI the subject lies on a bed that moves into the tubular scanner wearing earplugs to protect the ears from loud noises that occur during the scan. The procedure takes about 1 hour.    ,NCT00450021
Healthy,Correlation of 6-Minute Walk Test and Neuromuscular Parameters in the Elderly, The six-minute walk test had been used to assessment the cardiopulmonary parameter in patients with lung and heart disease.

Healthy,Modulation of Motor Function by Stimulation of the Central and Peripheral Nervous System, Objectives Noninvasive stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous system including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) theta-burst TMS (TBS) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and cutaneous/peripheral nerve stimulation (CPNS) alone or paired with TMS (paired associative stimulation PAS) has been increasingly used in the investigation of cortical plasticity and as a possible adjuvant strategy in neurorehabilitation. It has been shown that TMS TBS tDCS and CPNS can successfully modulate motor function in healthy volunteers as well as in patients with neurological disorders such as stroke. One fundamental problem is that the optimal parameters of stimulation to modulate motor function by all of these techniques are not known. The purpose of this protocol is to explore within safe guidelines the effects of different stimulation parameters on motor cortical function on oscillatory brain dynamics measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) on eye movements and on fMRI activation. In addition this protocol will be used to train new fellows coming to NINDS Human Cortical Physiology Section (HCPS) in the use of TMS TBS tDCS and CPNS techniques. We expect that information emerging from these studies will allow us to 1)optimize the stimulation parameters to collect pilot data in healthy volunteer for future patient-oriented hypothesis-driven protocols2)to collect pilot data for power analysis for future patient-oriented hypothesis driven protocols and 3) to train new fellows in the use of these different methods. Study Population Up to 1000 healthy volunteers age 18 and older. Design Healthy volunteers will receive one or more of the following types of stimulation alone or in combination: (1) 1 Hz TMS for up to 30mins and up to 115% of resting motor threshold intensity (MT). These parameters are not being used for single-pulse TMS and paired-pulse TMS. Parameters for single-pulse TMS and paired-pulse TMS are variable as they depend on the sub-study. For paired pulses duration of each TMS pulse is up to 1 msec. Interval between pulses is up to 20 sec and intensity of stimulation is up to 100 % of stimulator s output depending on the sub-study. (2) TBS below 100% active MT; (3) tDCS up to 2 mA for up to 60mins (4) CPNS with intensities below 130% of the peripherally-elicited-motor-threshold for up to 2 hours. All of these parameters of stimulation and procedures have safely been used as previously reported in the literature. Sham stimulations will be delivered for each modality. Each subject may undergo up to 20 sessions spaced by at least one day depending on the particular exploration. To verify that the number of sessions per subject does not exceed 20 sessions the number of sessions per participant is tracked across substudies using CTDB. The AIs are responsible for entering into CTDB the subjects/visits. We will test the effects of these different forms of stimulation on motor cortical excitability simple motor tasks and functional neuroimaging measures. Some stimulation may be conducted before after or during fMRI scans eye movement recording MEG and/or EEG recording sessions. To identify the possible contribution of sub-cortical structures we will also measure M-wave F-wave and/or H-Reflexes. The goal of these exploratory studies is to obtain preliminary information on the effects of these various combinations of central and peripheral nervous system stimulation that would allow us to develop subsequent finely tuned hypothesis-driven protocols. Under this protocol we conduct: Exploratory Sub-studies. These substudies are exploratory in nature and are conducted in order to develop information to generate better informed hypotheses and/or power analyses. We have set an upper limit of 40 subjects per sub-study. Hypothesis-Testing Sub-studies. Hypothesis-testing sub-studies are studies with specific hypotheses to be tested. These sub-studies undergo statistical and PIRC review after 6 subjects per group (e.g. after 12 subjects 6 per arm if two groups are studied) before additional subjects can be recruited. Together the P.I. and PIRC will decide whether to continue the sub-study with more subjects without an amendment or whether an amendment or protocol would be necessary. A memo requesting a review of hypothesis-testing sub-studies for possible additional enrollment (beyond 6) will be sent to PIRC and the statistical reviewer. In addition to the sub-study types above this protocol is used to train new investigators and optimize various techniques and experimental approaches (e.g. appropriate MRI sequences parameters of TMS stimulation behavioral training duration). We devised a strategy to ensure that a sub-study engages only procedures authorized in protocol and consent form and is scientifically valuable. F...    ,NCT00453505

Healthy,Functional Neuroanatomy of Emotion Perception Recognition Learning and Memory, This study uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore the areas of the brain involved in different types of mental processes in particular the brain regions involved in perception recognition learning and memory. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. In this study it is also used to measure blood flow in different regions of the brain while the subject is presented auditory or visual stimuli. The subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a narrow cylinder) wearing earplugs to muffle loud noises that occur during the scanning process. Subjects are in the scanner no more than 2 hours. Healthy right-handed normal volunteers between 20 and 40 years of age who have at least a high school education may be eligible for this study. While undergoing MRI participants are presented visual stimuli (pictures or geometric shapes on a projection screen) or auditory stimuli (tones played through a set of headphones). Unpleasant stimuli such as loud noise electric shocks heat or tactile stimuli are administered occasionally. The intensity of these stimuli is similar to those experienced in practice sessions before the scanning. Participants receive between 30 and 60 visual or auditory stimuli during the scanning session and each stimulus lasts about 1 second. In some studies participants are asked to move a joystick that controls a rating bar presented on a projection screen to indicate when they expect to receive these stimuli and how sure they are that they will occur. Heart rate respiration rate and sweat gland activity are monitored during the MRI sessions using electrodes placed on the fingers to measure heart rate and sweat gland activity and a sensor strapped around the chest to measure respiration. Subjects are in the scanner no more than 2 hours. Following the experiment subjects may be asked questions about their experiences during the study.    ,NCT00458432

Healthy,The Effect of Low Level Ozone Exposure on Healthy Volunteers," The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the effects of 0.12 ppm ozone exposure on humans. We know from other studies that exposure to levels of ozone that are seen on bad air pollution days can cause an increased risk of illness and even death in some people with certain health problems like asthma and heart disease. We also know from studies we have done in our lab that even healthy people can have an inflammatory (an increase in the amount of bacteria fighting cells) response to high levels of ozone. We suspect that exposure to low levels of ozone makes the body more susceptible to things like allergens. For instance in persons allergic to pollen exposure to ozone in the environment may cause them to have more allergy symptoms when they are around pollen than they would have if they were not exposed to ozone first. In this study we are looking to find the lowest level of ozone to which healthy people can be exposed without seeing that increased immune response. We will use 0.12 ppm ozone; this is roughly the amount of ozone you would be exposed to on a ""yellow"" ozone day in the triangle area in the summer if you spent the entire day out of doors and exercising moderately.

Healthy,Effect of Electrical Stimulation (DC Polarization) to the Brain on Memory, This study will test the effect of direct current (DC) brain polarization (the application of a very weak electrical current to the brain) on learning and memory. Earlier studies have shown that DC polarization can temporarily improve the ability of healthy people to think of certain words. This study will explore whether it can also temporarily improve learning and memory. Healthy people 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Subjects participate in two experimental sessions at the NIH Clinical Center. The first session lasts about 1 hour; the second session on the next day takes about 10 minutes. At the beginning of the first session electrodes are placed on the subject's head and arm for brain stimulation. The current may be turned on for 25 minutes or only very briefly (sham stimulation). Subjects are not told which type of stimulation they are receiving. No stimulation is applied in the second session.

Healthy,Constitution of a Standardized Neural Imaging Database in Healthy Subjects, MRI is a powerful imaging tool used for the precise study of brain morphology (morphometric study tissue study study of connectivity). Isotopic examinations by Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPET) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are used to explore cerebral perfusion metabolism (99mTc- ECD SPET and 18FDG PET) as well as dopaminergic neurotransmission (123I FP-CIT SPET DATSCAN®). These examinations routinely contribute to the clinical diagnosis and surveillance of many neurological pathologies (dementias Parkinson syndromes epilepsies concussions vascular pathology brain tumors etc.). As a result of the original morphological and functional information they provide these examinations are being increasingly included in clinical research protocols involving the brain. The absolute or relative quantification of anomalies observed however can be obtained only after comparison to a database of normal subjects. The creation of these databases is currently limited by their cost and strictly single center nature (physical characteristics of each center's MRI gamma cameras and PET scanner). The aim of this multidisciplinary study is to constitute a standardized database of multimode neural imaging (SPET PET and MRI) to be able to objectively quantify anomalies observed in patients at the scale of a group or an individual for the diagnosis and surveillance of neurological diseases. Participants will be paid ??50. 60 healthy subjects between 20 and 80 years of age (30 men and 30 women) will be recruited over 3 years. 4 examinations will be programmed over 2 days (one cerebral MRI on 18FDG PET one 99mTc-ECD SPET and one DATSCAN®). The strictly single center character of this study is explained by the variability of the physical characteristics of the imaging equipment used (MRI SPET and PET scan) inherent to each center.    ,NCT00484523

Healthy,Effect of Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on Prostate Tissue [Short Title: DHT-3], The purpose of this research study is to understand the effects of a male hormone normally made in the body called Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the prostate gland that is located under the bladder. The knowledge gained from this study may be used to help in the future to develop a safe male hormonal contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in the safe treatment of low male hormone levels in men and in the treatment and prevention of diseases of the prostate. The investigators will be giving DHT in a gel form to be applied to the skin or a placebo gel (with no active drug in it). The investigators want to see the effects of DHT on levels of hormones in the blood and in the prostate gland itself. In addition the investigators will be studying the effects of DHT on the cells and genes expressed within the prostate. The effect of DHT on the prostate is not known. Some studies suggest blocking production of DHT in the prostate helps growth of the gland with aging (a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH for short) and may prevent prostate cancer. On the other hand DHT administration may shrink the prostate suggesting it may be beneficial for some men. Therefore further studies looking at the effect of DHT on the prostate are needed.    ,NCT00490022
Healthy,PROS-1-Male Hormonal Contraceptive Regimens on Prostate Tissue, The investigators propose to examine the in vivo responses to hormonal manipulation at the molecular level directly in the tissue of interest (prostate). As in the investigators' previous pilot study the investigators will use the novel approach of procuring tissue specimens from normal healthy men who might be chose to use a male hormonal contraceptive regimen were it available. The investigators will employ state of the art techniques such as laser capture microdissection (LCM) and cDNA microarrays to determine the tissue-specific consequences of male hormonal contraceptive regimens on the prostate. The results will help guide the design safety monitoring and selection of male hormonal contraceptive agents and provide valuable insights into prostate human prostate biology. The investigators will test the hypothesis that exogenous T administration that results in increased circulating T and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels will increase intraprostatic concentrations of T and its metabolite DHT. The investigators will test the hypothesis that the addition of a potent 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride or the progestin Depomedoxyprogesterone (IM DMPA) to T administration in young and middle aged men will decrease intraprostatic DHT and increase intraprostatic T concentrations compared to T alone. The investigators will test the hypothesis that the addition of a 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride or the progestin IM DMPA to exogenous T by reducing intraprostatic DHT will decrease prostate epithelial proliferation assessed by Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67LI) and increase apoptosis assessed by caspase-3 expression and decrease androgen-regulated protein expression such as prostate specific antigen (PSA). The investigators will test the hypothesis that the addition of a 5α-reductase inhibitor or the progestin IM DMPA to exogenous T by modifying the intraprostatic hormonal milieu will alter prostate epithelial gene expression. Specifically the investigators expect that the addition of the 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride or the progestin IM DMPA to exogenous T will result in decreased expression of androgen-regulated genes such as PSA.    ,NCT00490555

Healthy,The Role of 5-alpha Reductase in Mediating Testosterone Actions, In normal men the male hormone testosterone affects a number of things in the body including muscle function and sexual function. An enzyme in the body called 5-alpha reductase converts testosterone into another form called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which has slightly different effects. The purpose of this study is to find out how different amounts of the two different forms of testosterone affect muscle function and sexual function in healthy young men like you. This will be done by giving the men participating in the study different combinations of hormone-related medication for 20 weeks and making measurements before during and after the medications to look for changes in lean body tissue muscle size muscle strength and leg power as well as sexual function and sexual activity in all participants.    ,NCT00493987
Healthy,Gas Supply Demand and Middle Ear Gas Balance: Specific Aim 3a Part ii, The middle ear is an airspace located behind the eardrum that consists of two connecting compartments. The compartment directly behind the eardrum is called the tympanum and contains the three small bones of the middle ear the hammer anvil and stapes that function to transfer eardrum movements to the inner ear so that you can hear. Behind the tympanum is the mastoid cavity which is a larger airspace subdivided into small air cells of unknown function. For normal hearing it is important that the air pressure in the middle ear is similar to that of the environment so that the eardrum can move freely in response to sounds. The air pressure of the environment is not constant and is affected by changes in weather conditions (high and low pressure systems that move through the area) and by changes in elevation above sea level (the fullness in your ears that can be noticed when you ride in an elevator or in an airplane). The air pressure in the middle ear also changes because middle ear gas is constantly leaking from that airspace to the blood that flows through the walls of the middle ear. These effects (changing environmental air pressures and changing middle ear air pressure) are independent and cause the middle ear and environmental pressures to be different from each other. Periodically and during swallowing or yawning any existing difference between middle ear and environmental air pressure is reset to zero by the opening of a biological tube (the Eustachian tube) that connects the middle ear to the back of the nose. This allows gas flow between the middle ear and the environment which increases or decreases middle ear pressure to the level in the environment at that time. Most people cannot open their Eustachian tubes at will and the number of automatic openings varies from infrequent to often in a population. Whether or not a person's usual frequency of Eustachian openings is good enough to keep the middle ear pressure the same as environmental levels depends on how fast gas is lost from the middle ear by gas leakage (diffusion) to blood. For example in ears with very slow rates of gas loss the Eustachian tube does not need to open very frequently to keep the middle ear at environmental pressure. Some researchers believe that the mastoid compartment functions to control the rate of gas loss to blood with larger mastoid volumes associated with lesser rates of middle ear gas loss. In this experiment the investigators plan to test this by measuring mastoid and tympanum volumes using Computer tomography (CT) and the rate of blood to middle ear gas transfer using a technique that involves breathing air that contains laughing gas (Nitrous Oxide=N2O) and measuring middle ear pressure change using tympanometry (a technique that involves putting an ear plug into the ear canal and measuring the pressure). From past studies in patients undergoing short surgical or dental procedures the investigators know that breathing gas mixtures that contain N2O will increase the blood levels of that gas cause gas to go from blood to the middle ear and increase middle ear pressure. The investigators predict that the rate of change in middle ear pressure while breathing a gas mixture containing 25% N2O and the normal oxygen level (20%) of air will be less for those ears with larger mastoid volumes. If the investigators prediction is correct they will be able to explain why ears with larger mastoid volumes are better able to keep their pressure like that of the environment even if the Eustachian tube does not open often.    ,NCT00494364

Healthy,Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation and Isokinetic Training, The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) associated to an isokinetic training program in both young healthy men and women. Twenty subjects (10 men 10 women; 21±1.5 years) submitted both quadriceps femoris muscles to a strengthening program (3 sets of 10 isokinetic concentric repetitions at 30°/s) two days per week for 4 weeks. One limb was submitted only to the strength training (EX) while the other underwent the same training program but with NMES added to each contraction (Ex+NMES). The current used for NMES was Russian Current (frequency of 2500 Hz 50 bursts/s and pulse duration of 200 µs). The evaluation protocol included isometric and isokinetic concentric extensor torques at 30°/s. Men increased their torque in both tested modalities in both limbs with no difference between them. The angle of peak torque increased for the EX limb showing an altered tension-length relationship which did not occur for the Ex+NMES limb or for women. Women increased their torque for EX limb in both modalities which only occured for isometric mode in the Ex+NMES limb. However they showed a decrease in their acceleration time in Ex+NMES limbs showing they could produce a muscular contraction more readily than they did before training. The results of this study found that the association between NMES and isokinetic concentric voluntary strength training does not improve strength gains of voluntary training itself for young healthy subjects of both genders. However it could improve neuromuscular readiness to produce torque in women.    ,NCT00512018
Healthy,Validation of Dietary Calcium Questionnaires Using Diet Records, Dairy products continue to be an important source of calcium providing over half the calcium intake for most individuals. Educational interventions promoting adequate calcium intake with tools estimating dietary calcium that can be easily utilized by consumers would be a valuable asset to promoting skeletal health. Validation of these tools against standard dietary assessment methods enhances their utility. The Dairy Council of California has developed two dietary calcium questionnaires one electronic and one in print using known dietary sources of calcium including frequency of consumption and portion size. For these questionnaires to be effective in clinical and research settings they must be a valid measurement of dietary calcium intake. To measure the validity of the dietary calcium questionnaires one hundred seventy three women will complete the two dietary calcium questionnaires and one 3-day food record. The dietary calcium questionnaires will be validated against this established method of dietary intake measurement. The objective of this study is to validate two dietary calcium questionnaires that can be used in clinical and research settings against an established method of dietary intake measurement. It is hypothesized that both dietary calcium questionnaires will be a valid measurement of dietary calcium intake in women.    ,NCT00512733

Healthy,Cardiac Autonomic Functions During Head-out Immersion and During Head Down Tilt, Head down tilt (HDT) was widely used to simulate microgravity effects on cardiovascular system. HDT could be a suitable model of water immersion (WI) which is also used to simulate the cardiovascular effects of microgravity and which is not easy to study in laboratory. To define the possibility to simulate immersion by HDT a comparison between these models is required. A comparison between WI and few angles during HDT seems necessary to understand which angle is more adapt. The immersion induces an increase of the central blood volume. This increase is caused by a redistribution of blood from peripheral portions of the body to the intrathoracic circulation. It seems to load cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreceptors. These baroreceptors bring into play autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation and induce a bradycardia. HDT induces an increase in central blood volume as supported by the central venous pressure and cardiac volume increase and in return MSNA and heart rate decrease. These cardiovascular effects seem to be the same as the thermoneutral immersion and suggest that the ANS activation is the same during HDT and WI. Nevertheless a few previous studies about ANS in HDT indicate some discordant results: a sympathetic decrease was reported but several results show an increase of parasympathetic activity linked with a trend of increase of arterial baroreflex. The aim of this study is to assess ANS activity in HDT on different angles (-6° and -15°) and WI. The investigators suppose an increase of parasympathetic activity during WI corresponding to parasympathetic activation during HDT especially at -6°.    ,NCT00515645

Healthy,Postprandial Insulin Secretion and Appetite Regulation After Moderate Alcohol Consumption, A body of epidemiologic studies show that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a protective effect against type 2 diabetes. The importance of both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance and diabetes type 2 is widely recognized. Clinical studies show improved insulin sensitivity after a period of alcohol consumption compared to abstention. However postprandial insulin secretion and beta-cell function after a period of moderate alcohol consumption have scarcely been addressed in published literature. When consumed as an aperitif or with a meal alcohol is generally expected to stimulate appetite and food intake and thus might be a risk factor for over consumption and obesity. However the physiological mechanisms for this observed effect are not well understood. Furthermore previous studies lacked a link between physiological parameters and subjective parameters of satiety.    ,NCT00524550

Healthy,Efficacy of 3 Nutritional Supplements to Improve Diverse Outcomes in Children Under 2 Years of Age and Pregnant Women, The Mexican poverty alleviation program Oportunidades provides a fortified food supplement to all beneficiary children under 2 years of age and all pregnant and lactating women. Consumption of the supplements is well below recommended levels and the impact of the program on child growth and anemia is less than anticipated. This is likely due to a high degree of dilution by sharing of the supplements with other family members. We have also found evidence of a very high prevalence of overweight and obesity among beneficiaries of Oportunidades in both women and children. Given the micronutrient content of the fortified food it is likely that the impact of the program on child growth and the micronutrient status of women and children would improve considerable if the supplements were consumed daily in the recommended dose. This may be difficult given the wide-spread sharing within households - something that has been identified by many beneficiary families as a desirable behavior. At the same time we do not know whether daily consumption of the food which contains approximately 20% of daily energy requirements may contribute to undesirable weight gain in this population. In this context we have designed a cluster randomized controlled efficacy trail to compare the nutritional impact acceptability and use of three nutritional supplements. Supplements were randomly assigned at the community level (n=54) and pregnant women (n=750) and children 6 to 12 mo of age (n=900) invited to participate. The principal objective of the study is to compare the impact of Sprinkles and Nutrisano/Nutrivida using syrup/pills as a positive control group on child growth weight gain and retention in pregnant women and micronutrient status of women and children. We hypothesize that weight gain will be greater in the food group compared to the other two supplementation groups but impacts on micronutrient status and length growth in children will be similar.    ,NCT00531674

The ability to inhale medication may by judged by inspiratory flows. However the inspiratory portion of the forced flow/volume maneuver in young healthy children has not yet been described.Objectives: To document and analyze the forced inspiratory flow volume curve indices in healthy young children. Settings: Community kindergartens around Israel. participants; Healthy preschool children (age 2.5-6.5 years). Methods: The teaching method included multi-target interactive spirometry games (SpiroGame®) and accessory games for inspiration (e.g. inspiratory whistle). Results: One hundred and fourteen of 157 children performed duplicate full adequate inspiratory maneuvers. Repeatability between two maneuvers was 5.6% 4.0% 5.1% 7.3% for inspiratory capacity (IVC) forced inspiratory capacity (FIVC) peak inspiratory capacity (PIF) and mid inspiratory flow (MIF50) respectively. Inspiratory flow indices were significantly lower than the parallel expiratory flow indices and the time to reach PIF was significantly slower than the time to reach peak expiratory flow (mean?SD; 229??1ms vs. 92 ??ms; p<0.0001). The shape of the inspiratory curve was parabolic and did not change with age. Predicted equations that were formed were in agreement with the extrapolated prediction equation values of older children. We found that the majority of healthy young children can produce reliable inspiratory curves. Our results provide a framework for reference equations for inspiratory flow volume curve in the young ages. The clinical applications of these equations are yet to be explored.    ,NCT00533715

Healthy,Physiological Effects of Androstadienone Exposure," The reason for doing this research is to understand why different people show different responses when they smell an odor called androstadienone. Androstadienone is a chemical found in male sweat. Other studies have shown that smelling this chemical can cause people to experience sweating changes in skin temperature and changes in a stress hormone call cortisol. These responses which are called ""physiological effects"" are stronger in some people than in others. We are interested in finding out whether these individual differences are genetic that is caused by differences in our genes. Humans have about 1000 genes for odorant receptors. These are the molecules that bind and detect odor molecules in our nose and allow us to respond to so many different odors. It has been shown that some of these genes exist in two forms: a functional one and one that has been mutated and is therefore no longer functional. We think that people who do not respond to a specific odor may carry the non-functional form of the gene for the receptor that detects the odor molecule. To test this idea we want to find people who respond strongly to a specific smell and compare their odorant receptor genes with those of people who respond weakly to the odor.    ",NCT00553384

Healthy,The Effects of Red Wine and White Wine on Blood Estrogen and Progesterone Levels, Healthy pre-menopausal women will be recruited in order to test the effects of red wine and white wine on blood estrogen and progesterone levels. The women will be randomized and rotated through two different treatments (red wine white wine). Estrone and estradiol are hormones in the category of estrogens. It is known that the bodies of both men and women may convert (or aromatize) a certain amount of naturally occurring testosterone into estrogen. Aromatase inhibitors have been used to prevent this conversion or aromatization of testosterone into estrogen in the treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer in women. This inhibition leads to a marked decrease in estrogen (estradiol and estrone) levels. Naturally occurring aromatase inhibitors include grapes grape juice and red but not white wine. The aromatase inhibitory effects are attributed to wine phytochemicals and not to alcohol. Based upon this information the investigators will monitor the estrogen levels at various phases in the menstrual cycles of women since hormone levels naturally vary throughout the menstrual cycle. Several epidemiologic studies have found that there is a correlation with moderate to high levels of alcohol consumption and breast cancer. Therefore study participants will be asked to drink only a eight ounces of wine which should have minimal or no risk for the development of breast cancer.    ,NCT00572351

Healthy,Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Normal Reference Control Group Testing," The purpose of this research is to understand how to apply cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) to women with small artery heart disease by looking at the CMRs of women without heart disease. The investigators will study 40 women with no heart disease to learn more about the usefulness of CMR. Women suffer more than men from this disorder of the small vessels compared to the large vessels. This results in delays in diagnosis missed opportunities for treatment and likely contributes to the increased death rate from heart disease in women compared to men. Current testing for small vessel disease is invasive and not performed routinely and women are often not initiated on appropriate lifesaving treatment. New imaging and noninvasive technology exists that may improve this situation. Imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can now show the inner layers of the heart where the small vessel abnormality and myocardial ischemia exist. These techniques while promising have not been tested to determine if they can be used to diagnose and treat the small vessel coronary heart disease condition. They also have not been studied extensively in women without heart disease. Gadolinium the contrast agent that will be given Intravenously to all study participants during the cardiac MRI procedure is contraindicated to patients with renal impairment. Even though it will only be given once to each of our patients the investigators still wanted to establish the fact that these study participants have ""normal"" or good renal functioning by doing BUN and Creatinine blood tests prior to the administration of this contrast agent to their system. By adding these lab tests the investigators will be more cautious to the well-being and safety of the study participants. The investigators will be recruiting women aged 35-65 years with no known heart disease or heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Participants will discuss the cardiac magnetic resonance procedure with a research doctor and if they agree will fill out questionnaires related to their health have blood draw and then undergo the CMR procedure. This can be completed in 1 or 2 visits. No follow up is needed.    ",NCT00573339

The positive benefit of HIPAA?protecting a person's health information from abuse?is laudable but it comes at a cost: it will deny investigators the benefit of access to chart (medical record) review in order to gather data to answer clinical questions. In the past investigators were allowed access to patient's charts because the hospital consent form included a clause indicating that the patient's information may be used for research. The investigators propose to overcome this crisis and challenge with a proven method of identifying individuals who would be willing to consider participating in a clinical trial: The Women's Guild Health Research Registry. In keeping with the focus of the Women's Health Program we would propose to enroll only women. The registry will allow qualified investigators to identify potential study participants. This idea has been effective at improving the quantity and quality of women able and willing to participate in trials. The investigators will also allow other approved sites to utilize the Registry via the approved procedure of submitting an IRB approved protocol which will be reviewed by our Internal Review Committee. This protocol's inclusion/exclusion criteria will be used to query the database for eligible participants. The participants will be contacted by the Registry staff to ascertain their interest in this research protocol and their agreement to release their contact data to the investigator will be obtained. Investigators will be charged at the time they approach the registry for assistance. The charge is intended to cover the cost of maintaining the registry now that initial funding has been exhausted.    ,NCT00574314

Healthy,Genomic Tools for Studying the Ecology of the Human Vaginal Microflora, The human vagina contains a large number of normal bacteria. These bacteria are important because provide protection against other bacteria that may cause disease. Several important diseases are linked to abnormal bacteria in the vagina. Women with abnormal bacteria in the vagina are more likely to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus the virus that causes AIDS. Also women with unusual bacteria in their vagina are more likely to deliver a premature baby when they are pregnant. For these reasons it is important to have a better understanding of the normal bacteria of the vagina.Some bacteria found in the vagina can not be grown in a laboratory. Our preliminary studies indicate a very wide variety of bacteria in the vagina. Also we have shown there are some differences between African American and Caucasian women. The goal of our study is to study the bacteria in the vagina of normal women using the latest technology. This technology involves study the bacterial DNA present in the normal microbes in the vagina    ,NCT00576797

Healthy,The Role of L-arginine in the Endothelial Dysfunction, Acute cardiac and vascular events like heart attack and sudden cardiac death manifest a clear surge in the early morning hours around the time of waking so that their peak onset is between 6AM and 11AM. The mechanisms are not fully understood but we had shown that healthy subjects have impaired vascular reactivity in the early morning (endothelial dysfunction). This is associated with a decrease in nitric oxide levels (a substance that promotes vasodilatation). We also have described that vessel reactivity and the levels of this substance can recover by noon only when people breakfast. L-arginine is a semi-essential amino acid found in large quantities in chicken in fish and beans and is the substrate for the production of nitric oxide Therefore we want to test if there is a beneficial effect of administration of L-arginine on the circadian pattern of vessel reactivity. Our goal is to understand why cardiovascular events are more likely to happen in the early morning and how to prevent. The research will help us to understand the efficacy acute effects and tolerability of high doses of L-arginine. This can lead to future research to assess long term effects of L-arginine supplements to prevent cardiovascular events in the early morning hours.    ,NCT00583388

Healthy,Phenytoin as a Neuroprotective Agent Against Corticosteroid-induced Functional Imaging Changes, The purpose of this research is to determine if patients who receive phenytoin (also commonly known as Dilantin) before taking corticosteroids will show less memory impairment and hypomanic symptoms (feelings of agitation overexcitement or hyperactivity) than those receiving placebo (an inactive substance). This research also seeks to determine if patients taking phenytoin before corticosteroids show more activity in the area of the brain involved with memory than those receiving placebo. This research is being done because increased levels of cortisol (the body's natural corticosteroid) in the body are frequently associated with forgetfulness and interventions that may prevent or reverse this effect are of great importance.    ,NCT00591006

Healthy,The Effects of Aspirin and Acetaminophen on the Stomach in Healthy Volunteers," Aspirin is a medication commonly used to relieve minor pains. Aspirin has also been used to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Aspirin however can also cause damage to the stomach and/or intestinal lining leading to the development of erosions (""small sores"") and/or ulcers (""large sores""). Erosions may cause bleeding (""bleeding ulcers"") and/or perforations (""holes in the stomach""). Acetaminophen often referred by the brand name Tylenol is also used to treat minor pains but is not commonly recognized to cause damage to the stomach lining. Many patients often take both of these medications together. While the effects on the stomach lining of each medication when used alone are known the effects of both medications when used together are not. The purpose of this study is to show whether or not the collective effects of both aspirin and acetaminophen when used together increase the damage on the stomach lining when compared to either medication alone.

Healthy,Ramelteon for a Nap Prior to a Night Shift, Night shift-workers are often advised to take a prophylactic nap prior to starting the shift in order to improve alertness and performance. However individuals often report difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep at that time of the day secondary to the alerting influence of the near-24 hour circadian rhythm (biological clock). A sleep-promoting medication may improve the quality of an evening nap and subsequent alertness and performance during a night shift. We will use Ramelteon a melatonin agonist that is FDA approved for insomnia in order to test the following hypotheses:   1. ramelteon compared with placebo will significantly increase sleep efficiency during a 2-hour nap;   2. sleep inertia as assessed by neurobehavioral tests and subjective and objective sleepiness assessments will not be significantly increased after ramelteon treatment compared with placebo treatment; and   3. neurobehavioral performance subjective and objective sleepiness and subjective mood during a simulated 8-hour night shift will be significantly improved when ramelteon is given prior to a prophylactic nap compared to a prophylactic nap with placebo.    ,NCT00595075
Healthy,Using a Sheathed Speculum to Visualize and Access the Cervix in Women With Excessive Vaginal Tissue, This new invention addresses the inadequate and incomplete visualization of the cervix in patients with excessive vaginal tissue. In general these patients are obese or are multiparous with a history of multiple vaginal deliveries. A vaginal speculum is a vital medical instrument that allows a health care provider to visualize the interior aspects of the vagina as well as the distal portion of the uterus the cervix. It is composed of 2 blades assembled together and held by a handle. The blades and the handle form a 90 degree-angle. As the user holds the handle a lever attached to the top blade allows it to open away from the inferior blade. When the instrument is inserted into the vagina the two blades are separated in order to keep the anterior and posterior vaginal walls apart. In that position the cervix and the walls of the vagina can be seen if the patient does not have an excess of loose vaginal tissue. However in patients with excessive tissue the sidewalls of the vagina simply collapse toward the midline between the blades because of the fact that no part of the speculum is in direct contact with the lateral walls of the vagina. This collapse prevents the complete and crucial visualization of the cervix for purposes of cervical cultures pap smears visual assessment of ruptured membranes visual assessment of the degree of dilation biopsies and other procedures requiring access to the cervix or the uterus. When clinicians face this dilemma they may try the largest speculum available and will open it as wide as possible in order to keep the lateral walls apart. Most often they have to improvise by cutting the tip of a condom or the thumb off a glove or they use a sterile lateral-wall retractor. These other creative solutions can take several minutes of precious times and may still result in an inadequate visualization and suboptimal access. A vaginal speculum sheath for retaining vaginal tissue in a lateral direction conforms to a pair of blades that are movable between an opened position and a closed position. The blades in the closed position are adapted for insertion into a vagina and in the open position they allow dilating the vagina in order to provide access to the cervix. This new design includes a flexible transparent polyurethane sleeve structure that extends between the blades when the speculum is opened. The stretched sheath is adapted to retain the lateral walls of the vagina in the open position. The elastic sleeve is designed to remain in a collapsed configuration when the blades are in a closed position to avoid interfering with insertion or withdrawal of the speculum [Reference: U.S. patent 6432048 (2002-8-13)]. Polyurethane material is FDA approved for vaginal use. The purpose of this study is to compare standard of care speculum vs. sheathed speculum in the examination of patients with collapsing vaginal sidewalls during a gynecological speculum exam. The primary hypothesis testing for this study will be to compare the standard of care speculum exam to a sheathed speculum exam in a prospective randomized clinical trial.    ,NCT00595166

Healthy,Epidemiology of Sleep Disturbances Among the Adult Population of the Sao Paulo City, Sleep disturbances are of great relevance within the context of public health as they affect a sizable portion of the population with far reaching consequences. Many automobile and labor accidents as well as poor school and work performance can be traced to sleep disturbances which are also linked to cardiovascular disease metabolic syndrome and psycho-cognitive alterations. OBJECTIVES:   1. Establish the epidemiologic profile of sleep disturbances among the adult population of the city of Sao Paulo in 2007;   2. Investigate associations between sleep patterns and disturbances in that population taking into account the following variables: social-demographic status anthropometrics clinical activity/rest cycle eating and physical activity habits mood disturbances sexual dysfunction in males alcoholism drug addiction genetic markers biochemical hematological endocrine immunologic and inflammatory indicators;   3. assess the compatibility of the results collected in the current study with those of epidemiologic sleep investigations of said city carried out in 1987 and 1995 with the aim of determining the secular sleep disturbance trend. METHODS: The two-stage cluster randomized sample included 1100 individuals of the city of Sao Paulo representing the population proportionally to gender age groups and social classes. Data were amassed as follows:   1. the application of home and institution questionnaires;   2. description of the sleep patterns and disturbances through polysomnography and actigraphy performed at the Sleep Institute;   3. collection of peripheral blood for biochemical hematologic endocrine and genetic assays. STATISTICS: Subsequent to double typing (inputting) and analysis of data consistency descriptive and analytical statistical assessments will be performed with the aim of describing patterns of sleep disturbances associated to the explanatory variables under investigation. In the light of bi-varied analysis predictive/explanatory multivaried models were adjusted.    ,NCT00596713

Healthy,Normative High-frequency MEG Database for Children," The objective of this study is to characterize the normal neuromagnetic profile of sensorimotor auditory visual and language cortices in children and adults using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We hope to build the world's first high-frequency MEG data for the developing brain. High-frequency neuromagnetic signals are associated with high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) ripple fast ripple or high-gamma activation in the brain. MEG is a new powerful tool for noninvasively measuring neuromagnetic signals originating from the brain. Since MEG can detect neuromagnetic signals with high spatial and temporal resolution many brain properties can be studied. For pediatric purposes MEG can (1) evaluate the functionalities of the sensorimotor auditory visual and language systems non-invasively during normal maturation; (2) identify abnormalities in these functionalities that occur with neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders; and (3) provide a pre-operative ""functional map"" for neurosurgeons to improve surgical outcomes and decrease morbidity and mortality. Previously MEG has been used to provide a single three-dimensional point that estimates the 'center' of cortical regions [12]. In this study three new techniques will be used to extend the usefulness of MEG beyond this point-like estimate of a cortical primary sensory input or motor output region. The three new techniques are independent component analysis S-transform and magnetic spatial filtering. The three new techniques for data analysis will be used in conjunction with non-invasive MEG data collection. The three techniques will provide us with the following important information about the brain: (1) the patterns of synchronization and de-synchronization of evoked cortical activation and (2) the volumetric extent of these active sensorimotor auditory visual and language cortices in children and adults. This approach may lead to a new way to study the brain functions in normal children and in children with various brain disorders.    ",NCT00600717

Healthy,PET Imaging of P-glycoprotein Function Using [11C]dLop, This study will test the use of a radioactive substance called [11C]dLop for measuring P-glycoprotein (P-gp) using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The P-gp protein acts as a pump in cells affecting a variety of functions such as limiting drug absorption and elimination and decreasing drug penetration into certain tissues such as the brain. It is a major obstacle to successful chemotherapy because it can pump cancer drugs out of the cells interfering with treatment. Decreased P-gp function may contribute to disorders such as Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease whereas higher levels of the protein have been found in patients with epilepsy and in several forms of drug-resistant cancer tumors. This study will determine uptake and clearance of [11C]dLop and the radiation exposure to organs of the body to assess its possible use in further studies of P-gp function. Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 51 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical examination and blood and urine tests. Participants undergo the following procedures:   -  Electrocardiogram (ECG): A test of the electrical function of the heart.   -  Brain PET scans: PET imaging uses small amounts of a radioactive chemical called a tracer that labels active areas of the brain so the activity can be seen with a special camera. The tracer used in this study is [18F]FMPEP-d(2). Before starting the scan a catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the arm to inject the tracer and another catheter is placed in an artery in the wrist to obtain blood samples during the scan. For the procedure the subject lies on the scanner bed. A special mask is fitted to the head and attached to the bed to help keep the person s head still during the scan so the images will be clear. A brief scan is done just before the tracer is injected to provide measures of the brain that are helpful in calculating information from subsequent scans. After the tracer is injected pictures are taken for about 2.5 hours while the subject lies still on the scanner bed. Blood and urine tests are done after 24 hours after the scan.   -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI scan is done within 1 year (before or after) of the PET scan. This procedure uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain. The subject lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a tube-like device) wearing earplugs to muffle the noise of the machine during the scanning process. The test takes about 1 hour....    ,NCT00605254
Healthy,Effect of Dietary Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) on Parathyroid Hormone in Men, The parathyroid gland and its hormone have a major impact on the endocrine control of bone metabolism and mineralization and parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been identified in some epidemiological reports to relate adversely to mortality. Previously the applicant has demonstrated in two models that dietary cis-9 trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) reduces PTH by over 30% in as little as 4 weeks in male rats without adversely affecting bone density. Both bioactive PTH and intact PTH assays have been used and both are reduced by CLA. In one rat model rats had normal PTH and a sub-group had high PTH due to chronic renal disease. In the second study the rats were healthy young males and females. Regardless of the model and health state PTH was reduced 30 to 40% by CLA. Of interest other isoforms of CLA such as trans-10 cis-12 CLA do not alone result in reduced PTH. The selected CLA isomer proven to reduce PTH cis-9 trans 11 CLA is common to food products such as milk fat and beef and is thus more physiologically relevant to the human diet. The global objective of this study is to for the first time; assess the effects of CLA on PTH in humans specifically men. Healthy men 19-53 years of age are selected since bone mass will have reached a peak by this age. Beginning with healthy relatively young men is important versus aging or ill individuals since the effect of CLA on PTH has not been examined and aging and illness might confound the results. Subjects will be recruited using posters and local newspaper advertisements from the general population. Men (n=30/group) with healthy weights will be randomized to receive 0 1.5 or 3 g CLA/d for a period of 4 months. At baseline body weight will be assessed along with whole body bone lean and fat mass using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Regional bone mass (lumbar spine total hip femoral neck) will also be examined using DXA. A blood sample will be taken in the fasted state between 9:00 and 10:00 to examine PTH ionized Ca and biomarkers of bone metabolism. After each 1 month on the study the measurements will be repeated until end of study. Dietary intake will be monitored along with a survey for possible mild side-effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort. Data will be examined using a mixed model for random (age weight vitamin D status) and fixed effects (diet time) with post-hoc comparisons using Bonferroni correction.    ,NCT00608400

Healthy,Effect of Gamma Tocopherol Supplementation on Neutrophil Response to 20000 EU of Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin in Normal Adults, The purpose of this research study is to learn whether high dose vitamin E (gamma tocopherol) will affect the way your body responds to an acute inflammation in your lungs. Vitamin E is found in soybean and vegetable oils as well as many plant seeds. Gamma tocopherol (gT) a component of vitamin E composes 70-80% of Vitamin E in the U.S. diet. Alpha tocopherol (aT) another large component of vitamin E makes up less than 10% of vitamin E in the U.S. diet but is the major form in blood and tissue. It is also the major form of Vitamin E in over-the-counter supplements. However gT has anti-inflammatory properties which are not present in aT. Preliminary data suggests that gT protects from ozone-induced exacerbation in animal studies and previous studies have shown levels of gT are inversely associated with heart disease. We will ask you to undergo a challenge with endotoxin which is a bacterial component of air pollution. From other studies we have done we know that if you inhale 20000 EUs (endotoxin units) we will see an increase in the number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that your body produces to fight infection) in your lung cells without causing you to have flu-like symptoms. We will investigate if there is a change in your lung inflammatory cells after the endotoxin challenge when you take the gT versus when you take a placebo.    ,NCT00631085

Healthy,Activating Seniors to Improve Chronic Disease Care, Chronic diseases are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality for older Americans. Active patient participation in treatment decision-making has the potential to significantly improve outcomes in chronic disease care but interventions to increase participation remain underused. Some studies have found that older individuals are less interested in participating in clinical decision-making but other studies find that exposing patients to decision aids (PtDAs) increases their desire to take an active role in making decisions with their physicians. The present study targets hard-to-reach seniors by showing decision aids focused on chronic disease management in senior centers. Decision aids will be made available in two senior centers through a lending library and by conducting group screenings of the decision aids followed by moderated discussion of the content with participants. A randomized encouragement design will be used to test the effectiveness of a modest financial incentive on increasing seniors' participation in group screenings. The investigators will evaluate the effects of the intervention on seniors' decision-making role preferences attitudes perceived social norms and self efficacy for asking questions of their physician health-related quality of life physical activity and changes in prescribed treatment regimens and self-care.    ,NCT00651495

Activation of TGF-β receptors induces the activation of several kinase signalling cascades leading to the phosphorylation of SMAD proteins as well as to the activation of SMAD-independent kinases that collectively activate ECM synthesis and fibroblast growth and differentiation into myofibroblasts. TGF-β1 is one of the main mediators in the fibrotic process associated to both scarring and a long list of pathologies related to chronic inflammation and which affect all type of organs and tissues. An increase in TGF-β1 mRNA and protein levels has been described in these processes. Peptide 144 (P144) is the acetic salt of a 14mer peptide from human TGF-β1 type III receptor (betaglycan). P144 TGF-β1-inhibitor has been specifically designed to block the interaction between TGF-β1 and TGF-β1 type III receptor thus blocking its biological effects. P144 has shown significant antifibrotic activity in mice receiving repeated subcutaneous injections of bleomycin a widely accepted animal model of human scleroderma and could contribute to the development. The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety of topical application of P144 in healthy volunteers.    ,NCT00656825

Healthy,The Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Healthy Human Subjects, It has been suggested that the therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are mediated through changes in cortical inhibition (CI). However in healthy subjects the effects of rTMS on CI have been inconsistent. The aim of this study is to explore different rTMS - stimulus conditions neurophysiological and molecular mechanisms in the human motor cortex. Fifty-six healthy subjects will be randomized into three different treatment groups and receive 1 active or sham rTMS session (6000 rTMS pulses) at 90% of their motor threshold (MT). Cortical inhibition will be indexed pre and post treatment using short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) cortical silent period (CSP) and long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI). Based on previous studies we hypothesize that:   -  Hypothesis 1: rTMS will result in a greater CI (i.e. prolonged CSP increased LICI but not SICI) compared to sham rTMS.   -  Hypothesis 2: 20 Hz rTMS will result in a significantly greater CI compared to 1 Hz rTMS.   -  Hypothesis 3: There will be distinctive transcription profiles associated with increases in CI from rTMS that can be detected with whole-genome microarray analysis of peripheral leukocytes.    ,NCT00658307

Healthy,Growth Hormone Administration and the Human Immune System, Background: - In elderly individuals an age-associated decline in the immune system s ability to function is believed to contribute to increased incidence of infection autoimmune disorders and cancer. This decline in immune system function may be related to the decline in the body s production of growth hormone which helps regulate human development and may contribute to the health of the immune system. Researchers are interested in studying whether growth hormone given as an infusion over time can improve the function of the immune system and other body systems associated with good health. Objectives: - To study the effects of growth hormone administration on the immune systems of healthy men. Eligibility: - Healthy men between 25 and 50 years of age. Design:   -  This protocol will involve three separate studies: Study I Study IB and Study II. Participants in Study I and Study IB may participate in Study II as directed by the researchers.   -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination and will provide blood urine and stool samples; have a glucose tolerance test; and have other tests as required by the researchers.   -  Participants will have an infusion pump with a small catheter inserted beneath the skin to administer the study chemicals (either growth hormone or placebo).   -  Study I and Study IB participants will receive pulses of growth hormone through the infusion pump at regular intervals to monitor the body s response to the hormone. Study IB participants will receive a higher dose of growth hormone than Study I participants.   -  Throughout the study period all participants will have frequent blood and urine tests as well as tests of glucose tolerance and metabolism imaging studies and other tests as required by the researchers.   -  Study II participants will be divided into two groups. The first group will receive pulses of either growth hormone or placebo infusion at intervals throughout the day for 4 weeks followed by an 8-week period without infusions. The second group will receive conventional once-a-day infusion of growth hormone or placebo for 4 weeks followed by an 8-week period without infusions.   -  Throughout the study period all participants will have frequent blood and urine tests as well as tests of glucose tolerance and metabolism imaging studies and other tests as required by the researchers.    ,NCT00663611

They reported that active younger and older women require similar RI between sets to recovery full isokinetic knee extension peak torque (PT). However we are unaware of any published studies comparing RI PT recovery between younger and older men. Thus the purpose of this study was to compare the effect of two different RI's between sets of isokinetic knee extension exercise on PT and Total Work (TW) between untrained younger and older men.    ,NCT00673998
Healthy,Infectivity of Norovirus in Shellfish Treated With High Hydrostatic Pressure Processing-Human Challenge Study," Norwalk virus and related ""Norwalk-like viruses"" are the most common cause of outbreaks of stomach sickness (nausea vomiting diarrhea) in older children and adults in the United States. These viruses are sometimes found in drinking water ice shellfish and in other foods. They can be spread easily from contact with water food objects or hands that have even small amounts of feces from someone who was sick. The purpose of this research study is to the effectiveness of high hydrostatic pressures processing (HPP) treatment on norovirus infected shellfish. Norwalk virus can survive in shellfish and still be able to cause sickness. HPP inactivates microorganisms living both on the surface and on the interior of the food. The goal of the study is to determine whether HPP treatment on oysters spiked with norovirus will reduce infection rates in people consuming raw infected oysters.    ",NCT00674336

Healthy,Comparison of the Pharmacokinetics of Two Generic Antidepressants and Their Respective Brand Preparations, Generic medications should be the equivalent of brand medications with the exception of their price. Before a generic medication is introduced its bioequivalence within a window of 80 to 125% of the original has to be demonstrated. There are reports that this criterion is not always followed in post-marketed periods. Such investigations were triggered by the observation that some patients previously stable on original medications relapsed when switched to a presumable equivalent generic. Several factors could account for this problem. Given reports of such problems occurring with the antidepressants citalopram and venlafaxine some pharmacokinetic properties of specific brands of generics and the originals will be examined for these two medications. Twelve healthy male volunteers will participate in this crossover study. It is anticipated that there will be significant differences emerging between the two formulations given the clinical reports of patients deteriorating when switched from the original to the generic preparations.    ,NCT00676039

Healthy,Effects of Fish Oil and Red Wine on Oxidative Stress Biomarkers," The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) recently encouraged ""increased consumption of omega-3 fatty acids in the form of fish or capsule form (1 g/day) for risk reduction"" and stated that ""for treatment of elevated triglycerides higher doses are usually necessary for risk reduction"" (Smith SC et al. Circulation 2006;113:2363-72). These recommendations are based on conflicting evidence about the efficacy of the omega-3 treatment with data derived from single randomized trials or non-randomized studies (Smith SC et al. Circulation 2006;113:2363-72). Much effort has been undertaken to elucidate the role of omega-3 fatty acids in the development of cardiovascular disease but even recent meta-analyses deliver no clear picture; they either favor (Mozaffarian D Jama 2006;296:1885-99) or reject (Hooper L Bmj 2006;332:752-60) the hypothesis of cardioprotective effects of omega-3 FAs. The objective of the clinical study is to study the effects of fish oil on blood and urinary markers of inflammation and cell stress. By using different permutations of high-dose supplementation of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids versus different alimentary omega-3 fish doses and grain alcohol versus different kinds of red wine this trial will study how omega-3 fatty acids ethanol and red wine constituents modulate biomarkers of inflammation and cell stress.

Healthy,The Acute Effects of Capsiate During Exercise, Capsiate is a non-pungent analogue of capsaicin the component of hot peppers that makes them hot or spicy. Unlike capsaicin capsiate is not spicy or hot. Ingestion of capsiate has been shown to increase resting oxygen consumption body temperature and the burning of fat. As such capsiate appears to act in a manner similar to that of many other substances that energize us increase our alertness and cause a rushing feeling by affecting a system in our body that is responsible for the release of adrenaline. The major difference however is that capsiate is broken down in the stomach into two components: vanilla and a fatty acid and is not absorbed as capsiate into the blood stream at all. This implies that the way capsiate works is likely by acting on the cells in the gut (before it is broken down)rather than affecting all other cells in the body as it would do if it ended up in the blood. Therefore the gut cells are thought to be the ones responsible for triggering the full-body adrenaline response. In any case the use of capsiate has been shown to be effective in preventing weight gain and as such it may represent a possible therapy for treating obesity. Many obesity-related programs not involving medication advocate the use of diet and/or exercise. However one of the biggest problems with weight loss from dieting alone is a general decrease in our body's ability to burn the food we eat as energy. This very problem is the reason for why people turn to adrenaline-releasing drugs like caffeine and ephedra. Unfortunately though if too much is consumed there is a high risk of bad side-effects. However low dose caffeine/ephedra compounds (that are within specified FDA limits) have recently been reported to be effective. Moreover these compounds are used with great frequency by people attempting to lose weight. Given that capsiate increases body temperature promotes the burning of body fat and has an exceptionally great side-effect profile it looks to be a very effective supplement for use in treatment of obesity and overweight. As such it would be important to test this supplement along with exercise. This is because consuming capsiate with exercise may enhance its effectiveness in increasing the burning of body fat. The primary purpose of this study is to examine the response of young healthy males to a 90 minute bout of moderate intensity cycling after having consumed 0 mg 3 mg or 10 mg of capsiate.    ,NCT00692601

Healthy,Pharmacokinetics of Inhaled Monodisperse Fluticasone Propionate, Asthma is most effectively treated by delivering inhaled drugs from an inhaler (puffer) directly into the lungs. Inhaled steroids are used in asthmatic patients to dampen down lung inflammation which unchecked can often lead to patient symptoms. Inhalers deliver a mist containing particles of lots of different sizes (like hairsprays). Medical puffers used by patients produce a 'coarse' mist of drug particles which have the potential for side effects as different sized particles will reach different parts of the airways and include; the mouth the throat the windpipe and the bloodstream (all places we do not want the inhaled drug to go ??and can give rise to important side effects)and the lungs (where we do want the drug to 'deposit'). Our aim in this study is to test an inhaled steroid by giving it to subjects as a 'fine' mist containing drug particles of nearly all one size using a research nebuliser (a Spinning Top Aerosol Generator). We shall use small intermediate and large drug particle mists. We aim to find out how much of the drug goes to the blood stream for each particle mist and compare it with the standard puffers used in routine clinical practice. We hope this study will provide information to the rationale that by improving the efficiency of drug delivery (by changing drug particle size) one may improve inhaled drug delivery and ultimately clinical patient benefit. Healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients will be recruited at the Royal Brompton Hospital London. The study is funded by GlaxoSmithKline Research & Development U.K.    ,NCT00692978
Healthy,Effect of Spinal Ketorolac After Acute Opioid Exposure, This research study is being done because pain is a significant problem for patients with a variety of medical problems and following surgery or traumatic injury. Currently available pain medications may not treat all types of pain or may treat pain only at doses that produce side effects and complications. The medication in this study may have a role in better treatment of pain. The goals of this study are to see if a dose of ketorolac (non-narcotic pain reliever) given into the fluid in the back near the spine has any effect on pain or discomfort in the skin sensation that will take place after applying capsaicin (chili pepper) cream. The sunburn-like sensation that people experience after having capsaicin cream applied is similar to but much milder than the pain that some people have after surgery and after certain types of nerve injuries. This study will test the effects of combining two medications that are often given together to control postoperative pain or pain from a nerve injury. The investigators are especially interested in answering two questions about the effects of ketorolac (non-narcotic pain reliever) and remifentanil (intravenous [IV] narcotic painkiller):   1. How much does remifentanil (narcotic painkiller) affect the sunburn-like painful area on your skin which develops after applying capsaicin cream?   2. What pain relieving effects does spinal ketorolac have when given with IV remifentanil?    ,NCT00693160

Healthy,Effects of Butyrate Enemas on Colonic Health, Short chain fatty acids (mainly acetate propionate and butyrate) are produced in the large intestine by bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates such as dietary fibers. Mainly butyrate is an important energy source of the mucosa and has a pivotal role in the regulation of mucosal proliferation immune function and mucosal protection. High fiber diets increase the concentrations of colonic butyrate what has often been proposed as one of its protective mechanisms. Furthermore butyrate enemas have been proved effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. In the present study the direct effects of butyrate on the distal colon will be studied in 30 healthy volunteers using rectal enemas. The study has been divided into two parts each part studying different parameters which interfere when measured synchronously and therefore need to be studied separately. A. The effects of butyrate enemas on colonic permeability (n=15) B. The effects of butyrate enemas on parameters of colonic defense integrity and inflammation (n=15) The effects of butyrate will be studied in a healthy and in a stressed colon. This way the protective effects of butyrate on intestinal stress can be studied. Prior to the main study two small pilot studies will be carried out. In the first pilot study the retrograde spread of a rectal enema will investigated (n=2). In the second pilot study the dose and the type of a suitable stressor that will induce reversible damage to intestinal mucosa will be determined (n=12).    ,NCT00693355

Healthy,X-Ray Computed Tomography and Blood Reactive Oxygen Species Level, The clinically widely used X-ray computed tomography examination has a low-grade radiation effect and recently has attracted much attention concerning the possible adverse effects of radiation on human body [ref. 1-5]. The radiation is harmful to human tissues and cells mainly because it can interact with water (which makes up to 80% of cells) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) especially the formation of hydroxyl radicals. So far as we can reach there is no report concerning the relation between X-ray computed tomography examination and the blood ROS concentration. Therefore we wish to conduct this study to clarify if the routinely applied X-ray computed tomography examination may induce a higher concentration of ROS in the peripheral blood. Study subjects will be participants of health check program at our hospital. The only enrollment condition will be a scheduled X-ray computed tomography examination for either lung (20 cases) or heart (20 cases) of the study subject. Another 20 participants receiving health check program without X-ray computed tomography examination will be included as the control group. The formal consent will be delivered to the participants of health check program several days before their admission for health check and will be retrieved before the proceeding of health check. Measurements and comparison of ROS concentration will be performed in the sampled peripheral blood before and after the performance of X-ray computed tomography examination during a regular health check program. Totally 120 blood samples will be collected from included 60 study subjects within 3 months. Reactive oxygen species（ROS）levels will be measured by a chemiluminescence (CL) analysing system (CLD-110 Tohoku Electronic Industrial Sendai Japan).    ,NCT00712998

Healthy,Explore the Nature Factors Relevant to Learning-Pioneering Natural Factors That Influences Science Learning II, Genetic research has provided the most exciting breakthroughs in neuroscience and cognitive science. Partially genetically determined cognitive impairments have been described in people with COMT 5HT6 BDNF (Swillen et al. 2000; Moss et al. 1999 Henry et al. 2002 Bilder et al. 2002)and biological systemic pathway candidate genes. Selective inhibitors of COMT proved to improve cognitive function in animals and in patients with Parkinson's disease (Carlsson et al 2000). Recent studies suggested that variation in COMT activity might have neurobiological effects specific to the prefrontal cortex; the COMT (Val) allele with high activity impairs tasks of prefrontal cognition in people with schizophrenia (Egan et al. 2001) and higher loading of the COMT (Met) allele is associated with better cognitive performance on attention and processing speed in people with chronic schizophrenia (Bilder et al. 2002). Moreover prefrontal dopamine levels are increased in COMT knockout mouse model (Gogos et al. 1998). This suggests that in people who have heterozygosis on COMT dopamine levels could be abnormal. Thus variation in COMT expression could also affect performance on prefrontal cognitive tasks. In the previous study we found the neuropsychological profile in students with COMT (Met) allele is better in object perception problem solving and planning and abstract and social thinking (Henry et al. 2002). 5-HT6 inhibitor has been reported to raise extracellular acetylcholine levels in the cortex and hippocampus (Dawson et al. 2001 and Riemer et al. 2003). Acetylcholine release in hippocampal and cortical regions is known to be important for memory acquisition and retention and several groups have demonstrated that 5-HT6 blockade overcomes scopolamine-induced amnesia. We hypothesize that variations in COMT and 5-HT6 are associated with genotype that will cause a poor/better performance in cognitive tasks. With the aim to establish the possible correlation between candidate genes (COMT 5HT6BDNF and biological systemic pathway candidate genes. etc) and cognitive ability which will provide us an understanding on factors and its extent that affect students' thinking and then develop appropriate teaching models or strategies for assisting students in learning. It seems timely therefore to consider how we might implement our increased understanding of brain development and brain function to explore educational questions.    ,NCT00713570

Healthy,Technical Development of Interventional Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Normal Volunteers, This study will test new techniques to image the heart blood vessels and legs using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The techniques will be used to plan and guide treatments using minimally invasive methods. Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. For MRI the subject lies flat on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner a metal cyclinder. Special antennas covered in pads are placed against the subject s body. The scan time can vary from 20 minutes to 2 hours with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. The subject may be asked to wear adhesive patches on the chest for monitoring the heart and a belt or finger pad for monitoring breathing. During the test a contrast agent called gadolinium may be injected. This substance brightens the heart and arteries during the scan providing a better picture of blood flow. During the procedure subjects may be asked to exercise their legs on a machine to evaluate the effects of motion and exercise on the MRI exam. Large blood pressures cuffs may be placed on either or both thighs or calves to try to measure arterial flow to the legs. The cuffs are inflated to a pressure as high as at least 50 mmHg higher than thesubject s systolic blood pressure (up to 250 mmHg) for up to 10 minutes. Subjects may be asked to return for repeated scans.    ,NCT00720460

Healthy,Evaluation of Vascular Pathology With 3D Time-Resolved Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Aortic coarctation is a relatively common cardiovascular condition with high associated mortality if not treated. Even with successful repair however close follow up is needed as late complications can result in significant cardiovascular morbidity. MRI with is ability to provide both anatomic and hemodynamic information is becoming the imaging option of choice for post-intervention surveillance. Time-resolved three-dimensional phase contrast magnetic resonance velocity (4D Flow) profiling enables the acquisition of multidirectional blood velocity data. The technique is well suited for evaluation of blood flow patterns in the thoracic aorta. By comparing aortic flow patterns in patients status post coarctation repair with those of healthy volunteers using 4D Flow this study intends to characterize abnormal flow patterns in these patients with the eventual goal of better understanding and predicting late complications so that preemptive intervention may be taken. Given the potential use of 4D Flow for evaluation of other types of vascular pathology in the aorta and other vascular regions we hope to investigate the use of the technique on a limited basis for a broader population of adult patients. Other research groups have had success evaluating peripheral stenoses as well as intracardiac and intracranial blood flow patterns with 4D Flow.    ,NCT00722904
Healthy,Investigation of Lungfunction Normal Values in Children and Adolescent in Germany (Spirometry Ultrasonic Pneumography and Exhaled NO)," Synopsis: LUNOKID-Study Investigation of Lung function Normal Values in Children and Adolescent in Germany For the diagnostic work-up of childhood airway diseases lungfunction measurements play an important role. As childhood represents a period of continuous development and growth not only is body size and weight increasing and body composition changing with age but also is the lung developing both in size and airway differentiation. Results from lung function measurements in children and adolescents have thus to be related to lung function data which have been determined in a normal healthy age-matched childhood population. The quality of the reference values is therefore crucial for the interpretation of lung function results. The reference values for children that are used today have been created between around the 1970th or 1980th although the development and body size of children in the last decades has considerably changed and accelerated. The aim of the LUNOKID study is to create new reference values for lung function measures in healthy children aged 4 to 18 years. Measurements will be performed in schools and ""kindergartens"" in 3 regions of Germany (Wesel Düsseldorf Hannover). A modified ISAAC questionnaire will be distributed to the parents to get information on the family´s and child´s health history with regard to atopy airway diseases or other diseases that could influence the lung function results. A clinical examination on the day of lung function performance should exclude acute infections or other diseases. Parents will have to give informed consent to the study. Study personal especially trained in the lung function unit of the University Hannover is going to do all examination and lung function measures during the normal school hours at the sites of the schools and kindergartens. The following measurements will be performed according to the respective SOPs:   -  Body weight and hight   -  Exhaled NO using the NIOX -MINO in children from the age of 5 years onwards in 4 years old children using the off-line method (both Aerocrine)   -  Spirometry including Flow volume curves (Parameter FEV1 FEV0.5 FEV 0.75 PEF FVC MEF 25 MEF 50 MEF 75) using a Spirometer by the company ndd Medizintechnik AG Zürich   -  Ultrasonic pneumography (UPG) (tidal breathing) ndd Medizintechnik AG Zürich It is planned to have 50 valid measurements per gender and age group. Considering that about 50 % of the children (and 50-75% of the 4 years´old) have to be excluded for the ""normal reference analysis"" either for health reasons or because the lung function measurement cannot be correctly performed. The investigators therefore calculate to included in the study around 3300 children. All data will be gathered and managed in a central database in the IUF in Düsseldorf. The statical analysis will include regression analyses to calculate the reference values. It is planned to have the new reference values included in the guidelines for diagnostic and management of asthma in childhood and in the software of lung function equipment. By now the study is approved by the Ethical Committee responsible for the PI in Wesel.    ",NCT00723619

Healthy,Investigation of Drug-drug Interaction Between Clopidogrel and Fluoxetine, Clopidogrel is a platelet aggregation inhibitor witch prevents thrombotic events in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease. To date 4 to 30 % of patients are considered as poor low or non-responder to this therapeutic. However drug-drug interactions may lead to decrease the clopidogrel responsiveness. Many arguments are in support to a drug-drug interaction between clopidogrel and fluoxetine (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). On the pharmacokinetic level fluoxetine inhibits the cytochroms involved in the production of clopidogrel active metabolite. On the pharmacodynamic level fluoxetine could increase the risk of hemorrhage by inhibiting the serotonin platelet reuptake and thus enhance the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of fluoxetine on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic of clopidogrel.    ,NCT00732290
Healthy,Defining Vitamin D Insufficiency in School Age Children: A Randomized Placebo Controlled Trial of Vitamin D3, The study objective is to characterize the threshold levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D for the definition of vitamin D insufficiency in 8-14 year old African American and Caucasian children. We propose a 6 month randomized placebo controlled trial of vitamin D (vitamin D3 1000 IU/day vs. placebo) initiated during October through March (during fall and winter) in 8 to 14 year old African American and Caucasian children. The results of the trial will help establish the cutoff threshold value of serum 25(OH)D for defining vitamin D insufficiency in preadolescent and adolescent children. Safety of vitamin D supplementation will be assessed by measuring serum calcium at 0 2 and 6 months and by monitoring for adverse events. Currently recommended adequate intake for vitamin D of 200 IU daily may not meet the body's daily needs for vitamin D. Therefore it is likely that a higher level of daily vitamin D intake may be needed to meet the body's skeletal and non-skeletal demands for vitamin D. Determining the dietary required intake of vitamin D for the prevention of vitamin D insufficiency during childhood has immense public health potential for addressing health disparities and ensuring better bone health during adulthood. The primary outcome measure will be serum 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH). The secondary outcome measures will include: markers of bone formation (serum P1NP) and bone resorption (serum CTX).We will also examine differences in serum 25(OH)D PTH and markers of bone turnover in African American vs. Caucasian children.    ,NCT00732758

Healthy,Influence of Rapydan on Clinical Chemistry and Hematology Measurements, There is an increasing awareness of the importance of treating procedure-related pain. Patients undergoing vascular access procedures are often afraid of needles and the discomfort associated with injections. This type of pain and/or fear can be stressful to patients. [1] For prevention of the pain associated with these procedures the hospital is using Rapydan plasters. Rapydan consists out of two local anesthetics: lidocaine and tetracaïne. Rapydan produces topical anesthesia after an application time of 30 minutes and is used in the Martini Hospital for pain relieve by venipuncture and IV cannulation. The venous blood draining the anaesthetized skin contains a higher blood concentration of the local anesthetics than does venous blood in other parts of the body [2] Although the concentrations of the local anesthetics are low in patients with normal skin the question is whether the presence of the local anesthetics which Rapydan contains might influence routine measurements in clinical chemistry and hematology.    ,NCT00765934

Healthy,Effect of Fructose on Colonic Microflora," Fructose is the principal carbohydrate in fruits and is added to many food products. This 6 carbon sugar is associated with a number of ill effects like promotion of high triglyceridesprecipitation of gout in menpossible depression in women and symptoms of intolerance in a non ethnic dose dependent fashion.However high fruit and vegetable intake is associated with some epidemiologic evidence in prevention of some cancers like stomach and colorectum.The principal protectors in these products are thought to be antioxidants and other protective chemicals like polyphenols.In addition long chain polymers of fructose:inulin are thought to help protect against cancer through prebiotic effects. In fact poly-fructose molecules are used as prebiotic food supplements and are promoted as aids for a healthy intestine with ""balanced microflora"". Polyfructose prebiotics induce some gastrointestinal symptoms of cramps gas bloating and sometimes diarrhea.To date repeated consumption of these polyfructose molecules have not been shown to induce colonic adaptation. Nor is there evidence that fructose intolerant people ""adapt "" to prolonged ingestion. These findings are in contrast to findings with lactose intolerance where prolonged ingestion leads to both symptomatic and physiological adaptation.In this interventional study we evaluate whether fructose intolerant people can adapt to moderate dose daily fructose ingestion.The desired outcome is symptomatic physiological and colonic microfloral adaptation. A failure to detect an increase in bifidobacteria on retesting may suggest that in humans like in some other mammals GLUT5 fructose transport could be induced.    ",NCT00775567

Healthy,Assessment of Digital Radiograph Measurements of HipSpine and Lower Limbs," Research Protocol Assessment of Hip Spine and Lower Limbs Digital Radiograph Measurements in Pediatric Population: using PACS integrated Computer Software (TraumaCad from OrthoCrat ??. Introduction The integration of the PACS system into many medical institutions created a plethora of digital measurements to assess anatomic and deformity parameters for torso and limbs. A number of commercial digital software is being offered to supply the medical practioner with tools to assess normal and pathological bony architecture land marks. The relevant architecture of the pelvis (hip joint) spine and the length and alignment of lower limbs may be measured using these digital software's. The validity and accuracy of digital work in comparison to conventional radiographs has been studied recently mainly with lower extremity axial alignment the digital length and anatomical angles measurements were found to be more reliable in terms of intra observer reliability than conventional radiographs (1 2). Study purposes   1. To compare the accuracy and reliability of specifically designed digital software (TraumaCad from OrthoCrat ?? measurements using wizard guidance to those produced by using the tool bar (ruler and angle guide tools) of the DICOM folder.   2. To assess intra and inter observer reliability of the TraumaCad software for different pediatric orthopaedics conditions. Methods *Twenty hip joins radiographs (AP views) of patients who suffer from Cerebral Palsy (10) and Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (10) will be measured using the TraumaCad software hip joint wizard and than again using basic tools of the DICOM folder. **Twenty spinal scoliosis radiographs (AP and Lat views) will be measured using the TraumaCad software templates. ***Ten digital radiographs of long leg standing (AP views) from normal and from patients with deformities will ne analyzed for length and angular differences using the LLD wizard. The following parameters will be measured *Hip joint radiographs: Acetabular Angle Central Edge Angle and Reimer's Index **Spinal radiographs: Cobe Angle (AP views) Coronal Balance Sagital Balance. ***Long standing views: length of Femur and Tibia mLDFA mMPTA mLDTA JLCA (the ""Baltimore numbers""). All measurements will be taken by 4 senior orthopaedic surgeons after consensus conference for the technique. Intra observer reliability will be tested by repeating the same set of measurements on 2 different dates after all radiographs are randomly mixed and done at least 2 days apart. High resolution single computer will be used for all measurements by all participating surgeons. The intra and inter observer reliability for the hip joint measurements will be calculate to compared between TraumaCad software wizard and the DICOM measurements tools. All measurements using TraumaCad software will be analyzed for intra and inter observer reliability using accepted statistical tools. The study will be supervised by the department of statistics of TAU for maximum statistical significance. 1) Sailer J Scharitzer M Peloschek P Giurea A Imhof H Grampp S.

Healthy,Role of Nitric Oxide in Optic Nerve Head Blood Flow Regulation During Isometric Exercise in Healthy Humans, Autoregulation is defined as the ability of a vascular bed to adapt its vascular resistance to changes in perfusion pressure. In the eye several studies have reported that retinal blood flow is autoregulated over a wide range of ocular perfusion pressures. The investigators recently showed that nitric oxide (NO) is a key metabolite in the regulation of vascular tone in the eye and plays an important role in the blood flow autoregulation of the choroidal circulation. However no data is yet available for the optic nerve head. Thus the present study is designed to test the hypothesis that NO plays also a role in optic nerve head blood flow autoregulation. Therefore subjects will perform squatting to increase systemic perfusion pressure during administration of either a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NMMA) an α-receptor agonist (phenylephrine) or placebo. Optic nerve head blood flow will be continuously measured during the procedure to investigate optic nerve head autoregulation.    ,NCT00806741

Healthy,Validation of Brain Oxygenation Monitor, A cerebral oximeter is a device that uses light to measure the amount of oxygen within the brain. It is similar to the device that measures the level of oxygen in the tip of the finger known as a pulse oximeter. The cerebral oximeter consists of a sensor placed on the forehead that both emits and detects the amount of light absorbed. This study will determine how accurate the device is by comparing the displayed value on the monitor with blood samples taken simultaneously from the arterial blood in the wrist and venous blood in the neck. In order to test the device over a suitable range the level of oxygen within the blood will be reduced in a controlled manner by reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration. This is the equivalent of ascending to an altitude of 16000 feet. The study will be conducted in healthy volunteers.    ,NCT00815490
Healthy,Methylphenidate in Healthy Young Adults," Background: There is a paucity of data as to the effect of methylphenidate (MPH) on young adults who do not have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The existing data is equivocal and focuses on neuropsychological functions that are not always relevant to the clinical aspects of attention. Objective: To determine the effect of MPH on a diagnostic continuous performance task that assesses attention per se (TOVA) and on a decision making test (Modified Gamble Decision Test) in young healthy adults. Methods: Fifty young adults men and women ages 20-30 without ADHD learning disabilities history of past or present use of MPH or other psychotropic drugs will be eligible to participate. Design: The experiment will be conducted in 2 sessions the first lasting 3.5 hours and the second 2.5 hours in a randomized double-blind prospective design. In the first session the subjects will be screened for ADHD past and present major psychiatric diagnosis (depression anxiety etc) use of MPH in the past psychotropic medications or recreational drugs and any other chronic illness; urine will be tested for beta-hCG to rule out pregnancy. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured. The participants will then be given either placebo or MPH (15-20 mg) and after 90 minutes will proceed to complete the TOVA (that lasts 22 minutes) and Modified Gamble-Decision Test (15 minutes). Before taking the pill and prior to the testing the subjects will complete the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which quantifies their subjective feelings regarding present mental and emotional state. In the second session 2 weeks later blood pressure and heart will be measured and the VAS completed prior to and 90 minutes after taking the tablet. The subjects then undergo the TOVA and Modified Gamble-Decision Test. Data Analysis: will be performed using the paired t-tests for parametric variables and one way ANOVA with repeated measurements. Significance: Results of this study are important since MPH is used and abused by healthy students as a ""study aid"" although its objective effects in normal young adults are not well delineated    ",NCT00815841

Healthy,Measurement of the Folate Receptor in Blood, The folate receptor (FR) is a cell marker that is over expressed on the cell surface of certain cancers this occurs most frequently in ovarian cancers. Some normal tissues also express the FR however in these normal tissues the FR is usually located on the tissue surface that is inaccessible to circulating drugs. As such drugs which target the FR may potentially be used to achieve anti-tumour efficacy whilst reducing toxicity to normal tissues. Therefore the ability to measure FR levels from different cancer types may help to select patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment with FR targeted therapies. One such drug BGC 945 is currently being tested in preclinical study at The Institute of Cancer Research    ,NCT00838747

Healthy,Study Comparing Two Vitamin D Supplements for Infants: Liquid Versus D-Strips, Vitamin D supplementation (400 IU/d) is recommended for all breastfed infants in Canada. Such recommendation is grounded in the fact that the prevalence of rickets in Canada is higher than desirable likely due to low maternal-fetal transfer and low intakes postpartum. There is little data about adherence to supplementation in Canada but one study shows that in primiparous mothers (n=1937) in Quebec 58.1 % of those exclusively breast-feeding gave their infant vitamin D supplements in the first six months and 62.1 % of those feeding formula did not. For the Canadian situation it is not clear if the modality of the supplementation is a barrier to providing the supplement. Thus the overall aim of this study is to test a new delivery system for parental preference and infant acceptance compared to a standard vitamin D supplement.    ,NCT00846677

Healthy,Determination of Method-specific Normal Cortisol and Adrenal Hormone Responses to the Short Synacthen Test, Synacthen® is a synthetic analogue of ACTH which has been used since the 1960s to assess adrenal sufficiency. It is now well established as a first line test to investigate diseases of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and to assess adrenal function in patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy. Briefly cortisol is measured before and after injection of 250 micrograms of Synacthen®. In a normal individual serum cortisol will rise to concentrations greater than an arbitrary value (typically 550 nmol/l) 30 minutes after administration of Synacthen®. In 2004 the All Wales Clinical Biochemistry Audit group surveyed protocols for performing and interpreting short Synacthen® tests. This identified wide differences in practice within Wales. As a result standards were drawn up for performance of the test. It was noted that there was considerable variability or bias between cortisol immunoassays and that the cortisol cut-off chosen for interpretation of the short Synacthen® test should be method dependent. Clark et al. in 1998 reported cortisol cut-offs following Synacthen® using 4 well established commercially available cortisol immunoassays. This study demonstrated considerable differences between the cortisol immunoassays used in clinical laboratories at the time. It was also apparent that there were differences in gender-related responses to Synacthen® although there was no dependence on age. In the 8 years since publication of this study there have been advances in formulation of cortisol immunoassays as well as the instrumentation used to perform analyses. At the University Hospital of Wales cortisol is currently assayed using the Bayer Centaur automated immunoassay analyser. This assay was not available at the time of the study by Clark et al.. The investigators' current short Synacthen® test cut-offs therefore rely on historical reference ranges which have become outdated. A re-evaluation of the cortisol cut-off is required to ensure that patients are not incorrectly classified. It has been long been recognised that oestrogens (including ethinyloestradiol prescribed in combined oral contraceptive pills) increase total (but not free) serum cortisol levels. The degree of increase is related to the dose used and is thought to be due to an elevation in cortisol binding globulin (CBG). However no comparisons of total serum cortisol in response to Synacthen® have been performed between women taking oestrogens and those who are not. Knowledge of the salivary cortisol response may also be useful in patients with decreased serum CBG concentrations e.g. severe nephrotic syndrome in whom the serum cortisol response may be misleading. The investigators therefore plan to measure salivary cortisol as part of the investigators' study protocol to assess the response of free cortisol. 17 Hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cortisol. Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase enzyme activity leads to an increased concentration of 17OHP in the peripheral circulation. The short Synacthen® test can be used to assist in diagnosis of mild cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Current reference ranges are taken from the literature.    ,NCT00851942

Healthy,Family Research Study: Metabolism of Fats and Proteins in Specific Ethnic Groups, The purpose of this study is to determine whether lipoprotein(a) also called Lp(a) is a risk factor for cardiovascular (heart) disease. Lipoproteins are tiny particles that circulate in the blood. They contain cholesterol fat and protein in varying amounts depending on the body's need. Higher levels of lipoproteins in the blood can cause an increased risk of heart disease. The investigators believe that by studying the Lp(a) lipoprotein in Caucasians and African Americans the investigators can assess for genetic variation factors related to cardiovascular (heart) disease. The investigators will be looking at 100 African-American families and 100 Caucasian families to confirm whether a higher Lp(a) level is an indicator of a higher risk for heart disease.    ,NCT00853775

Healthy,Comparison of Enteral Versus Parenteral Feeding in Healthy Human Subjects, Literature suggests that route of feeding and/or certain nutrients may cause alterations in the body's immune cells. Immune cells help protect the body and fight infection/disease. Tube feeding (TF) is a method of delivering nutrition directly to the stomach/intestines via a small tube. The immune system may respond differently when receiving continuous TF as compared to receiving intermittent TF. Heart rate variability (HRV the intervals between heartbeats) is a measurement of the nervous system's response to a stress/illness. The differences in immune cells and/or HRV may influence how the body reacts to complications such as infection.    ,NCT00856219

Healthy,The Bioequivalence of Atripla in an Oral Liquid Formulation Compared With the Tablet Formulation in Healthy Volunteers, The primary objective of this study is to determine the average bioequivalence of tenofovir emtricitabine and efavirenz in an extemporaneously prepared oral liquid formulation (test formulation) compared with the commercially available tablet formulation (reference formulation). The study is designed as an open-label randomized 2-period 2-treatment 2-sequence single-dose intensive pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers. Subjects will be randomized to receive the Atripla tablet (reference formulation) or the Atripla tablet crushed and mixed in OraSweet solution (test formulation) on Study Day 1. Subjects will undergo a 12-hour intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation after ingesting a single dose of either the test or reference formulation. On days 2 and 3 subjects will provide an additional pharmacokinetic sample 24 and 48 hours post dose respectively. Subjects will complete a washout period from day 2 to day 14 during which no study drugs will be ingested. On day 14 subjects will ingest either the reference or test formulation (opposite of the formulation received on Study Day 1). All subjects will undergo another 12-hour intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. On days 16 and 17 subjects will provide an additional pharmacokinetic sample 24 and 48 hours post dose respectively. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be documented throughout the study. The sample size is 16 and is based upon a 10% drop-out rate (i.e. due to lost to follow-up treatment discontinuation etc.). Since the investigators are expecting two subjects not to complete the study the investigators expect 14 evaluable subjects. If the discontinuation rate is greater than 10% the investigators will continue to enroll until the investigators get 14 evaluable subjects. The primary endpoint is to determine average bioequivalence for test and reference formulations of tenofovir emtricitabine and efavirenz according to the FDA guidance on bioequivalence testing. The ratio of the test to reference formulation mean Cmax and AUC24 for each drug and the 90% confidence interval around each mean ratio will be determined. Average bioequivalence will be met if 90% confidence intervals around the Cmax and AUC24 mean ratios for each drug falls within the FDA's predefined limits of 0.80 to 1.25.    ,NCT00862823

Healthy,Coffee and In-vivo Oxidative Stress, Food and beverage intake that leads to a decrease in the level of in vivo markers of oxidative stress indicates that such foods and beverages act as antioxidants (AOX) in humans. Coffee drinking at a high level (> 900 ml/day) for a short period of time (1 week) has been shown to reduce DNA oxidative damage?as indicated by a decrease in the level of percent tail DNA (%T)??in study populations comprised mainly of young adults aged < 30 years. It is not clear whether such findings remain present over a longer period of time and to extend such findings across a population that is more representative of European adults who consume common daily intakes of coffee which is a low-to-moderate daily intake level (< 750 ml/day). As such the investigators propose to determine the effect of drinking 3 and 5 cups of coffee per day (equivalent to 450 and 750 ml per day respectively) for 8-weeks on markers of in vivo oxidative stress relative to control in a population of healthy adults free of chronic diseases aged 35 to 65 years.

Healthy,Impact of Menstrual Cycle on Antiretroviral Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Women, Data suggest that women taking drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have higher amounts of drugs in their body compared with men taking the same dose of anti-HIV drugs. The reason for this higher drug exposure has not been determined. The primary purpose of this study is to examine whether the pharmacokinetics (factors that determine the amount of drug in the body) of anti-HIV drugs change during different phases of the menstrual cycle in women and ultimately result in higher amounts of drug in the body compared with men. In other words we plan to examine whether changes in sex hormones throughout the menstrual cycle affect the amount of anti-HIV drugs in women. The antiretroviral drugs atazanavir ritonavir tenofovir and emtricitabine will be studied. This study will be conducted in healthy women since HIV may change the pharmacokinetics of anti-HIV drugs.    ,NCT00869960

Healthy,Exploring a Motor Learning Technique Based on the Mirror Motor Neuron System, Background:   -  Techniques that teach finger movements are commonly used to explore how humans learn to move. Researchers have designed a simple new method of learning finger movements which will be explored for the first time in this study. The method is based on how individuals mimic other people's movements.   -  Previous studies have shown that a brain protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be important in movement and in learning. There are normal variations in the gene for BDNF. As an optional component this study will also look at whether these gene variations are associated with differences in movement learning. Objectives:   -  To compare the new motor learning technique with a classic technique to test its usefulness.   -  To examine whether genetic variations have an effect on motor learning. Eligibility:   -  Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 50 who are right-handed. Design:   -  The study will involve two visits to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.   -  Visit 1: Medical and neurologic examination to determine whether the volunteer is eligible to participate further in the study. This screening visit will take about 1 hour.   -  Visit 2: Volunteers will perform a motor learning task by interacting with a computer program. In response to images on the computer monitor volunteers will press buttons on the keyboard as quickly and accurately as possible. The motor learning task will last up to 3 hours.   -  If a volunteer agrees to genetic testing researchers will also draw blood for study.

Hypothesis 2: The investigators predict that overweight children and adolescents (but not lean children and teens) will consume more food in the presence of their mother than in the presence of a friend. Hypothesis 3: The investigators also predict that overweight youth's energy intake will be related to parental prompts. Hypothesis 4: The investigators expect greater similarities in terms of food selection and food intake between adolescents and their friend than between adolescents and their parent.    ,NCT00875576
Healthy,Interest of Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in the Diagnosis of Fungal Infections, Invasive fungal infections have a major impact on the morbidity and mortality of immunocompromised patients including patients with hematological malignancies neutropenic patients human immunodeficiency virus infected patients diabetics solid organ transplanted patients and patients admitted in an intensive care unit. The survival of these patients depends on early diagnosis and prompt appropriate antifungal treatment. The early diagnosis of these infections is difficult because of the lack of sensitive test methods notably blood cultures. For these reasons the investigators decided to develop a real-time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) assay on blood samples. It should allow rapid response to establish a positive or negative diagnosis of invasive fungal infection could contribute strongly to the decision of treating using antifungals and should monitor the effectiveness and the optimization of antifungal prescriptions. The investigators' objectives are: First to validate an extraction method from blood infected by fungi species. Secondly the investigators want to develop three real-time PCR: A fungal real-time PCR able to detect most fungal species; a real-time PCR targetting Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus which are two clinically important pathogens. Then blood samples of patients (classified according to EORTC consensus) will be collected during the study in order to evaluate and validate our method on clinical samples. Results will allow the investigators to determine the sensitivity specificity and reproducibility negative and predictive values. Overall the investigators' work aims to evaluate the clinical impact of real-time PCR in the early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections and on the initiation or stopping of antifungal therapy. The economic impact resulting from the use of this method will be evaluated.    ,NCT00876096

Healthy,A Pilot Study to Evaluate the Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Response to the Challenge of Mixed Meals in Chinese Subjects, The purpose of the study is to standardize a meal test to facilitate future studies of the postprandial glucagons-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) response in Chinese subjects. Eighteen healthy Chinese subjects aged between 20-65 years old without history of diabetes will be recruited for the study. Each subject will receive two mixed meal tests for postprandial GLP-1 excursion at random order: 60 % carbohydrate (CHO)/20 % fat vs. 50 % CHO/30 % fat. The postprandial glucose insulin glucagon and other related hormones responses will also be measured. Through the study we hope to build up a platform for the study of the postprandial GLP-1 response and insulin secretion.    ,NCT00884091
Healthy,Effect of Reward on Learning in Motor Cortex, Background:   -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to take pictures of the brain. Some MRI studies suggest that this technique reveals brain differences in patients with a nervous system illness when compared to adults without a nervous system illness. Objectives:   -  To study functional changes in the brain that may be observed in people without any nervous system illness.   -  To learn more about which areas of the brain are necessary to perform certain tasks especially learning simple motor sequences and processing rewards. Eligibility:   -  Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 50 who are right-handed and are native English speakers and who have no medical conditions that would prevent them from undergoing magnetic imaging.   -  Volunteers must not have a history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses.   -  Female volunteers must not be pregnant. Design:   -  Volunteers will be asked to undergo different types of magnetic imaging including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and/or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while participating in either a slot machine simulation or a key sequence learning task.   -  Volunteers will participate in one of four possible experiments:   -  Experiment 1: MRS/TMS and slot machine (3 visits 3.5 hours in total).   -  Experiment 2: MRS/TMS and key sequence (3 visits 3.5 hours in total).   -  Experiment 3: fMRI and slot machine (2 visits 3 hours in total).   -  Experiment 4: fMRI and key sequence (1 visit 2 hours in total).   -  Experiment types:   -  Slot machine: A computer game like a slot machine where the user presses a button to start the game and watches as the three barrels of the machine spin into place.   -  Key sequence: Pressing a series of buttons in response to visual cues.   -  Volunteers will also be asked to give a small blood sample for genetic testing.   -  Volunteers will be paid a small amount of money (approximately $50 $80) during the experiments in compensation for their participation in the study.    ,NCT00885131

Healthy,Subcutaneous Administration of Lisofylline to Healthy Normal Subjects and Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes," Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases happen when the immune system does not identify part of the body as belonging to it. The immune system then destroys that part as if it were an unknown tissue in the body. In T1DM the body kills the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. Insulin is the hormone that ""unlocks"" the cells of the body. It allows glucose to enter and fuel them. Special cells in the body called islets make the insulin. Since glucose cannot enter the cells it builds up in the blood. The body's cells literally starve to death. Children are at risk of developing T1DM and the risk is much higher than other severe chronic childhood diseases. The only treatments are a careful diet planned physical activity and testing blood sugar levels several times a day. The patient must also inject insulin each day or use an insulin pump. There is no cure for T1DM. Insulin injections are considered life support because going without insulin for just a few days causes the blood to have too much acid in it and that can lead to death. On the other hand taking too much insulin makes blood sugar levels go too low and if untreated can lead to death as well. DiaKine is developing Lisofylline to treat the failed immune system. This is what caused T1DM in the first place and it does not go away. The purpose of this study is to see how safe the study drug is. The study is also going to compare the levels of study drug in the blood and to measure the effect of the study drug on other substances in the blood that are linked to type 1 diabetes. These levels will be measured after the study drug is given as an injection under the skin and an injection into the vein. To date Lisofylline has been tested when given as an injection in the vein. The investigators hypothesize that Lisofylline will be safe when given as an injection under the skin and in the vein and that levels of study drug will be very similar when given as an injection under the skin and in the vein. The investigators also hypothesize that Lisofylline will have a positive effect on the substances in the blood that are linked to type 1 diabetes.    ",NCT00896077

Healthy,Effect of Ghrelin on Sympathetic Nervous System, Ghrelin is a newly discovered peptide that is secreted by the stomach. Its main role is to stimulate food intake but recent studies indicate that it also acts on the cardiovascular system to confer beneficial effects. The mechanism of action is unclear but experimental studies suggest that ghrelin decreases the sympathetic nervous system. Beside there is new evidence in animal models that ghrelin may also be involved in stress reaction as ghrelin injection seems to protect against symptoms of stress. Given that circulating levels of ghrelin are reduced in obesity this suggests that the effect of ghrelin may differ between lean and obese subjects. Ghrelin could represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the study if to gain more knowledge of the effect of ghrelin on the sympathetic nervous system and stress reactivity in both lean and obese subjects.    ,NCT00912587
Healthy,Regulation of Optic Nerve Head Blood Flow During Combined Changes in Intraocular Pressure and Arterial Blood Pressure, Autoregulation is defined as the ability of a vascular bed to adapt its vascular resistance to changes in perfusion pressure. In the eye several studies have reported that retinal blood flow is autoregulated over a wide range of ocular perfusion pressures. In the optic nerve head only few data are available. Large scale studies have shown that reduced ocular perfusion pressure is an important risk factor for the prevalence the incidence and the progression of primary open angle glaucoma. Former studies that investigated ocular blood flow autoregulation only measured choroidal blood flow. For the optic nerve head only few data are available although it seems likely that it underlies similar autoregulatory mechanisms. The primary goal of the present study is to gain more insight into these phenomena in humans. The present study aims to investigate the pressure/flow relationship as a measure for optic nerve head autoregulation during combined changes of intraocular pressure and arterial pressure. Intraocular pressure will be increased by the use of a suction cup technique mean arterial pressure will be increased by squatting. During the whole procedure optic nerve head blood flow will be measured continuously.    ,NCT00912665

Healthy,Role of Nitric Oxide in Optic Nerve Head Blood Flow Regulation During Experimental Increase of Intraocular Pressure in Healthy Humans, Autoregulation is defined as the ability of a vascular bed to adapt its vascular resistance to changes in perfusion pressure. In the eye several studies have reported that retinal blood flow is autoregulated over a wide range of ocular perfusion pressures. Large scale studies have shown that reduced ocular perfusion pressure is an important risk factor for the prevalence the incidence and the progression of primary open angle glaucoma. Former studies that investigated ocular blood flow autoregulation focused mainly on choroidal blood flow. For the optic nerve head only few data are available although it seems likely that it underlies similar autoregulatory mechanisms. A previous study investigating choroidal blood flow has shown that nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in choroidal autoregulation. The present study is designed to test the hypothesis that NO plays a role in optic nerve head autoregulation during increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Therefore IOP will be experimentally increased using a suction cup device in the absence of presence of either a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NMMA) an α-receptor agonist (phenylephrine) or placebo. Optic nerve head blood flow will be continuously measured during the procedure.    ,NCT00914394
Healthy,Measurement of Retinal Blood Flow Retinal Oxygenation and Retinal Oxygen Extraction in Healthy Subjects During Normoxia and Systemic Hyperoxia, The inner retina is crucially dependent on an adequate retinal blood supply. When the retina becomes ischemic and hypoxic this results in severe vision loss due to retinal neovascularization. Measurement of retinal blood flow and retinal oxygenation is however still a difficult task. Information on retinal oxygenation is almost unavailable from human studies. In the present protocol the investigators propose a procedure allowing for the measurement of retinal blood flow retinal oxygenation and retinal oxygen extraction by combining a number of innovative techniques. Specifically retinal vessel diameters will be measured with a Retinal Vessel Analyzer retinal blood velocities with bi-directional laser Doppler velocimetry and retinal oxygenation with spectroscopic evaluation of retinal fundus images. This will allow for the calculation of retinal oxygen extraction a fundamental parameter of retinal function. Up to now no data for retinal oxygen extraction are available in the literature.    ,NCT00914407
Healthy,Effect of Antioxidants on Oxygen Induced Vasoconstriction in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Induced Inflammatory Model in Humans, Oxidative stress has been implicated in playing a pathogenic role in many disease processes especially in age-related disorders. It has been hypothesized that antioxidative agents such as vitamins and minerals which are capable of scavenging free radicals may reduce oxidative stress and may in turn be beneficial for patients with age-related disorders. Based on this hypothesis several different combinations of vitamins have been introduced all targeting at reducing oxidative stress. However the in-vivo determination of the antioxidative properties of a certain drug or vitamin combination are hard to determine. In the current study the researchers propose to investigate the effect of VITAMAC® a combination of vitamins and minerals in a systemic in-vivo inflammation model. In the present study the infusion of LPS which is a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria and a major mediator in the pathogenesis of septic shock will be used as a standardized experimental model of systemic inflammation in humans. Given that inflammation is associated with enhanced oxidative stress and widespread endothelial dysfunction the LPS model is well suitable for determination of the antioxidative effects of VITAMAC®. As a main outcome parameter the vascular reactivity of retinal vessels to systemic hyperoxia (induced by breathing 100% oxygen) will be tested in presence or absence of the antioxidant combination.    ,NCT00914576
Healthy,Regulation of Optic Nerve Head Blood Flow During Combined Changes in Intraocular Pressure and Arterial Blood Pressure, Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure. The existence of an effective autoregulation in the optic nerve head (ONH) circulation has been shown in animals and humans. Moderate elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) caused only slight effect on ONH blood flow in monkeys cats and rabbits. In humans during an artificial IOP rise using a suction cup method the ONH blood flow maintains almost constant until IOP reaches 40-55 mmHg. During isometric exercise the upper limit of autoregulation appears to be approximately 40% above the baseline ocular perfusion pressure. The mechanism behind ONH blood flow autoregulation is still unknown. The present experiments are designed to improve the investigators' knowledge of the physiology of regulatory mechanisms in ONH circulation which may be helpful for a better understanding of blood flow abnormalities in glaucoma. This is of importance because there is increasing evidence that vascular dysregulation plays a role in the development of glaucomatous damage.    ,NCT00914992
Healthy,Role of Endothelin-1 in Optic Nerve Head Blood Flow Regulation During Isometric Exercise in Healthy Humans, Autoregulation is defined as the ability of a vascular bed to adapt its vascular resistance to changes in perfusion pressure. In the eye several studies have reported that retinal blood flow is autoregulated over a wide range of ocular perfusion pressures. The investigators could recently show that Endothelin-1 is a key metabolite in the regulation of vascular tone in the eye and plays an important role in the blood flow autoregulation of the choroidal circulation. However no data is yet available for the optic nerve head. Thus the present study is designed to test the hypothesis that Endothelin-1 plays also a role in optic nerve head blood flow autoregulation. Therefore subjects will perform squatting to increase systemic perfusion pressure during administration of either an endothelin A-receptor blocker (BQ-123) or placebo. Optic nerve head blood flow will be continuously measured during the procedure to investigate optic nerve head autoregulation.    ,NCT00915070

Healthy,Investigation of the Effects of Exercise on Gene Expression, The investigators have previously shown that mild exercise training at the level of lactate threshold (LT) intensity (60 min/day 5 days/week) improves peripheral insulin sensitivity and insulin-independent glucose disposal of glucose effectiveness without changes in body weight and body fat (Nishida et al Diabetes Care 2001; Nishida et al Diabetes 2004). Thus these beneficial effects are likely related to a number of adaptations that occur in skeletal muscle as response to exercise. In the current study the investigators hypothesised that a single bout of mild exercise performed at LT would be a physiological stimulator of skeletal muscle PGC-1alpha gene and the repetition of this exercise stimulating PGC-1alpha gene (i.e. training) for 12 weeks would induce coordinated increases in a large number of metabolic genes as well as other genes potentially important in the prevention of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.    ,NCT00916019

Healthy,Trial to Assess the Effects of Different Trans-fatty Acids on Endothelial Function in Humans, The aim of the study is to compare a diet rich in trans fatty acids (TFA) from ruminant sources with a diet rich in TFA from hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHVO) in regard to their effects on cardiovascular risk markers (endothelial function blood lipids inflammation and coagulation parameters in the blood). After a two week run-in period (diet without TFA) volunteers are randomized into three groups with different diets: diet rich in TFA from ruminant sources diet rich in TFA from PHVO and diet without TFA. The intervention period lasts four weeks. A nutritionist introduces the basic issues of the study diets. All volunteers supply themselves according to the recommendations of the Swiss food pyramid. Fat free food can be chosen individually in the context of defined guidelines. The amount and source of the fat in the diet are strictly defined. During the whole study volunteers meet the nutritionist every 2 weeks and in the weeks between the volunteers are contacted by phone. The volunteers will continue their normal daily life and physical activities. At the beginning of the run-in period and at the beginning and the end of the intervention period the endothelial function of the brachial artery will be assessed using flow-mediated dilation (FMD)/nitro-mediated dilation (NMD) methods and blood samples will be collected to analyze blood lipids inflammation and coagulation parameters in the blood. Hypothesis:   1. Diet enriched with ruminant TFA has not the same negative effect on cardiovascular risk markers as diet enriched with the same amount of industrial TFA compared with a diet without TFA.   2. Diet enriched with ruminant TFA has not a more negative effect on cardiovascular risk markers as diet without TFA.    ,NCT00933322

The investigators now propose to determine the safe upper limits of the dietary essential amino acids. The recently published DRI (2005) defines the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) as 'the highest average daily nutrient intake level that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population.' As intake increases above the UL the potential risk of adverse effects may increase'. In this proposal the investigators define a novel method to define the safe upper limit where the 'maximum oxidative potential' of an amino acid identifies the 'metabolic limit' to dispose the amino acid. Intakes of amino acid above this level will increase the potential for adverse effects to appear.    ",NCT00972582

Healthy,Pilot Study of Pharmacology of Paracetamol Administered Per-oral Mucosa, Paracetamol is the centrally acting analgesic most commonly used in the world indicated for the symptomatic treatment of fever and pain in mild to moderate. It comes in different formulations for oral intravenous and rectal. The IV route allows rapid passage of paracetamol in the systemic arterial circulation and thus the brain faster distribution evidenced a higher plasma concentration compared with oral and rectal. However the IV route also has disadvantages well known risks iatrogenic perfusion is an invasive lengthy unpleasant and painful. The way per-Albus not to date used for the administration of paracetamol. It is a path nonetheless very interesting for the rapid absorption of drugs such as nitrates used in angina pectoris as it seeks a highly vascular area (the floor of the tongue or gingival groove) and allows a very rapid action. Furthermore the terminal per-oral mucosa less restrictive than IV administration and faster than oral administration requires a simple medical gesture without special surveillance after administration produces no pain or risk of infection for the patient (in contrast to the IV). It is interesting to test a new dosage form per-oral mucosa of paracetamol and compare pharmacological level (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) with the only dosage form of reference used by the IV route.    ,NCT00982215

Healthy,Family Eats:Cancer Prevention for Families, Poor diets lead to weight problems and may increase cancer risk. Cancers may develop over a long period of time with some possibly initiating in childhood. Therefore promoting healthy diets and preventing excess weight gain during childhood could be cancer protective. Families influence children's dietary behaviors by their actions and controlling the home food environment. The internet provides family access to interventions with the convenience of the home. An eight-session interactive web-based program promoting a healthy home food environment for African-American families with 9-12 year old daughters (Family Eats) was previously developed and tested. This study tests whether the Family Eats web program improves diet and weight outcomes among 320 African-American families with 8-12 year old children. This important study will pioneer a new channel for behavior change intervention with African-American families and holds the promise of reaching large numbers of children and their families enabling all to adopt healthy eating behaviors and achieve energy balance and reduce cancer risks.    ,NCT00983840

Healthy,Influence of Rabeprazole on the Magnitude of the Antiplatelet Action of Clopidogrel, The purpose of this study is to assess whether the administration of a proton pump inhibitor Rabeprazole has a negative effect on the activity of a concomitantly administered blood thinner drug. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI's) are prescribed for patients with gastric problems to reduce the gastric acid secretion. The blood thinner drug Clopidogrel administered in this trial is approved for the treatment of mild heart attacks; it works by preventing blood platelets from sticking together to form clots that would restrict blood flow. Previous trials have shown that the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole interacts with the blood thinning drug clopidogrel to reduce the active form of clopidogrel thereby preventing the drug's blood thinning effect. In this trial the effect of two different proton pump inhibitors namely rabeprazole and omeprazole on the activity of the blood thinner drug clopidogrel will be assessed and compared to the effect of placebo on the activity of the blood thinner drug clopidogrel. This will be done in three sequential periods and each of the patients enrolled into this trial will be asked to participate in three different periods during which clopidogrel with either rabeprazol or omeprazol or placebo will be administered daily.    ,NCT00989300

Healthy,Alcohol Exposure and Airway Hyperresponsiveness, Alcohol has well-established consequences in the lung including increased risk for upper respiratory tract infections pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There have even been a few reports of alcohol-induced asthma. Data from the investigators' laboratory have established that the airways are specifically impacted by alcohol exposure. Because the airways are heavily exposed to the vapor phase of alcohol during drinking and airway motor tone is modulated by cAMP the investigators speculated that airway bronchial motor function would be altered in mice fed alcohol. The investigators' preliminary studies demonstrate that brief alcohol administration significantly attenuates airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in a mouse model. This novel finding has led us to hypothesize that: Alcohol exposure modifies airway hyperresponsiveness through a cAMP/NO- dependent mechanism.    ,NCT00990275

Healthy,Impact of Formulation on Ciprofloxacin Oral Absorption, The purpose of this research is to see if certain tablet formulation factors affect oral drug absorption. Medications taken by mouth such as tablets need to be absorbed into the body in order to do any good. Tablets contain a drug but also contain non-drug ingredients that are called excipients or fillers. Excipients in the tablet and the way in which the tablet is manufactured both can impact how much drug is absorbed into the body. That is tablet formulation factors can cause a tablet to be effective or not effective. Tablets in this research contain the drug ciprofloxacin hydrochloride. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic to treat infections such as lung infections. This drug is being used since it has low water solubility and is probably sensitive to tablet formulation factors.    ,NCT00992329

Healthy,Does Mindfulness Training Change the Processing of Social Threat?, Training in mindfulness the non-judgmental observation of experiences as they arise in the present moment has been increasingly and successfully applied to the treatment of normative stress conditions and mental disorders. Yet the neurological mechanisms that underlie the reported improvements are still largely unknown. This longitudinal study will investigate the influence of mindfulness training on a key underpinning of mental health namely emotion regulation and its associated brain activity. Healthy participants will be randomly assigned to either a validated eight week Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program or to a control condition. In a pre-post investigation participants' subjective reactions to aversive emotional stimuli (affective facial expressions) will be assessed as will the associated brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The investigators hypothesize that after the training the MBSR participants will rate the pictures as less aversive compared to control participants. Furthermore the MBSR participants will show a patter of brain activation indicative of improved emotion regulation relative to control participants. Finally the effect of MBSR on the gray matter structure of the brain will be investigated.    ,NCT00992875
Healthy,Sensitive Periods in Early Flavor Learning, Flavor is the primary dimension by which young children determine food acceptance. However children are not merely miniature adults since sensory systems mature postnatally and their responses to certain tastes differ markedly from adults. Moreover emerging research has revealed that there are sensitive periods during infancy such that early flavor experiences serve to modify later responses to flavors and foods. The proposed study aims to investigate this important issue by using as a model system a class of infant formulas which are hydrolyzed protein based and thus have very pronounced and distinctive flavors which are unpalatable to older-aged infants and adults. This research was initiated because of anecdotal reports by pediatricians that although it is easy to introduce this type of formula to infants during the first months of life it becomes extremely difficult to do so later in infancy. Indeed recent studies in the investigators' laboratory provided the first experimental demonstration that infants younger than 4 months of age willingly accept substantial amounts of and satiate while feeding a novel protein hydrolysate formula. In marked contrast infants older than 4 months reject the protein hydrolysate formula and this rejection occurs within the first minute of a feed a finding that strongly suggests the sensory qualities of the formula are responsible at least in part for this rejection. Moreover this rejection is not evident when the investigators test older-aged infants with other unfamiliar but non-hydrolysate formulas. In other words the rejection appears to be in response to a particular component or components of protein hydrolysate formulas. This shift in acceptability can be ameliorated by prior exposure. That is if these formulas are introduced to infants within the first few months of life and are fed continuously they remain highly acceptable throughout infancy and early childhood. These observations implicate a sensitive period during development occurring somewhere before 4 months of age during which exposure to a formula which is unpalatable to adults and infants over 4 months of age without exposure renders it acceptable and presumably palatable. To the investigators' knowledge this is the clearest example of a sensitive period in the development of responses to foods and flavors in humans thus far identified. There is a paucity of information on whether and how the composition of formulas fed to infants influences their short-term feeding behaviors during the first few months of life. The primary objective of this longitudinal study is to determine the period during early infancy when exposure to the casein-hydrolysate formula Nutramigen renders it acceptable during later infancy. The study also aims to determine how early sensory experiences with formula impact upon food acceptance during infancy (8-9 months of age) and childhood. The investigators will also explore how variation in the genes that encode for taste receptors influence preferences for foods and other behaviors.    ,NCT00994747

Healthy,The Healthy Elderly Longevity Cohort," With the completion of the human genome project investigators can now explore new questions in human biology. Previously human genetics focused on highly penetrant Mendelian traits; however now rare and common variants can be discovered that affect ""common"" diseases that have multi-gene architecture with variable penetrance such as breast cancer diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. This change took place because investigators now have the tools to illuminate the whole genome at once to discover the genetic variants responsible for different disease phenotypes through statistical differences between populations. Besides disease phenotypes health can be considered a human phenotype that can be studied. Health is not merely the absence of disease but may be viewed as a dynamic ongoing interplay between the environment and the genome to maintain homeostasis. Individuals often attempt to optimize environmental conditions according to ones genome to maximize their health. All individuals possess potentially beneficial and harmful variants depending on the environment. How this dynamic interplay occurs between the genome and environment requires understanding the boundary conditions of the genetic architecture of health and disease and then modeling the system to simulate the observed data. The aging process also affects health. Aging involves a loss of the normal coping responses to internal and external environmental stressors or signals. Investigators now have the tools to uncover from the bottom up the mechanisms involved in maintaining the ability to overcome environmental conditions that can affect health. Against this genomic breakthrough of whole genome association studies the demographics in the United States are quickly changing. The older population (age > 65 years) in 2030 is projected to be twice as large as in 2000 representing nearly 20 percent of the total US population. The first baby boomers turn 65 in 2011 and will challenge all facets of health care in the coming decades. The demographic changes underscore the need to understand the mechanisms that promote health and disease in this cohort. Genomic discoveries will help individuals and may reduce medical costs and benefit society. In summary the objective of this study is to obtain blood and/or saliva samples in order to help model health and disease phenotypes through population genomics. The blood and/or saliva samples may allow for participants' entire genomes to be sequenced if such comprehensive analysis becomes feasible and economical.    ",NCT01004133

Healthy,Class 3 Biowaivers, The Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) is employed by the US FDA to categorize drug substances into 4 classes and to characterize drugs in terms of aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability. The four BCS categories for a drug substance are Class 1 Class 2 Class 3 and Class 4. Biopharmaceutical properties of aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability with drug product dissolution determine the rate and extent of drug absorption from immediate-release (IR) and solid oral dosages forms (e.g. tabletscapsules). Each class exhibits information regarding biopharmaceutic properties and bioequivalence. For example Class 1 drugs have the most favorable oral biopharmaceutic properties (high solubility and high permeability). With these biopharmaceutic properties for class 1 drugs results in vivo bioequivalence (BE) studies for rapidly dissolving IR solid oral dosage forms the FDA provided waivers. This approach alone has resulted in new and generic drugs approved based on vitro data alone (i.e. biowaived) with great savings in resources and reduction in unnecessary human testing. Objectives: 1) The primary objective of this study is to assess whether common excipients cause bioinequivalence of Class 3 drugs. 2) The secondary objective is the results of the study will contribute towards providing scientific evidence to the FDA for consideration of Class 3 drugs for BCS-based biowaivers. Hypotheses: The investigators anticipate that common excipients do not cause bioinequivalence. 1) Hence the hypothesize of this study is commonly used excipients in oral medications (tablets capsules) modulate the rate or extent of Class 3 drug absorption and result in bioinequivalence. 2) Alternative hypothesis is that commonly used excipients in oral medications (tablets capsules) do not modulate the rate or extent of Class 3 drug absorption and do not result in bioinequivalence.    ,NCT01010698

Healthy,Effects of Dietary Fructose on Glucose and Lipid Metabolism in Healthy Human Subjects," The increasing intake of fructose has been associated with an increase in obesity among US children and adolescents but its ""dose dependent"" effects on insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism has not been studied in detail. Methods: 36 healthy male adult human subjects will be included in this study. They will be randomly allocated into a low moderate or high fructose a moderate or high glucose and a sucrose diet for 3 weeks. In randomized order and with 4 week wash out intervals each subject will receive all six different diets. Three day food records will be used to measure total fructose and glucose intake. During the low fructose diet subjects will be instructed to avoid nutrients containing fructose aiming at consumption of less than 1g fructose/d. During the moderate fructose diet subjects will receive 3x13.3g of fructose or glucose respectively. High fructose diet subjects will receive either 3x26.7g/d of fructose 3x 26.7g/d of glucose or 3x 26.7g/d of sucrose in the form of three daily soft drinks taken together with the three main meals. 75 g oral glucose tolerance testing will be performed and composite insulin sensitivity index will be calculated The presence of phosphorylated fructose metabolites in plasma will be measured by targeted LC-MS/MS. In addition metabolite biomarkers in plasma will be screened by untargeted metabolite profiling using both LC-MS and GC-MS. In a subgroup of 10 subjects an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp will be performed using [66- 2H2]glucose. Thus the lipogenic potential of fructose in humans will be compared with isocaloric amounts of glucose. Particularly the question whether lipogenic effects are continuously dose dependent or whether there is a lipogenic shunting and if yes at what level of ingested fructose will be addressed.

Healthy,Resistant Starch Insulin Sensitivity Trial, The alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity is a cause of great concern given its association with many adverse health conditions including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes which are associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The primary objective of this project is to identify effective dietary strategies focused on carbohydrate quantity and starch digestibility to improve outcome variables associated with CVD risk in insulin resistant individuals who express components of the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (ALP). Current dietary guidelines emphasize substitution of carbohydrate calories for total and saturated fat calories for prevention and management of chronic disease. Yet we and others have shown that high-carbohydrate diets increase the expression of the ALP characterized by increased plasma triglycerides reduced HDL cholesterol and increased levels of small dense LDL particles and that this phenotype is reversed by moderate carbohydrate restriction. We have also shown that expression of stearoyl coenzymeA desaturase (SCD) an enzyme involved in triglyceride synthesis is reduced with carbohydrate restriction and that this change is correlated with plasma triglyceride response. While carbohydrate restriction is effective for management of ALP the role of starch quality has not been addressed. Furthermore there has been no study of the effects of resistant vs. digestible starches incorporated into high- vs. lower carbohydrate diets. Since isolated reports suggest that increased intake of resistant starch lowers plasma triglycerides and postprandial insulinemia we hypothesize that starch quality is an important determinant of components of ALP and that this may be mediated in part by reduced adipose tissue SCD expression. Aim 1 and of this proposal will address this hypothesis by a controlled dietary intervention in 52 insulin resistant men and women in which changes in plasma lipids lipoproteins and lipogenic gene expression will be determined after substituting resistant starch for digestible starch in a high- vs. lower-carbohydrate diet. In Aim 2 the fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin responses to a resistant vs. digestible starch meal will be measured to test the hypothesis that starch digestibility improves glycemic and insulinemic control in a way that relates to diet-induced changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins.    ,NCT01027325

Healthy,Time to Conceive: A Study of Fertility, The purpose of this research study is to learn a way to measure a person's fertility. After 1 year of trying 1 out of every 7 women will not be pregnant. This is called infertility. This results in significant distress and anxiety. Infertility is common; however the investigators have no markers to predict who will be infertile. For couples diagnosed with infertility the investigators have used blood and urine hormone levels (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) inhibin B and antimullerian hormone (AMH)) to tell us who will get pregnant with fertility treatment. The investigators don't know if these hormone levels can predict if regular people trying to get pregnant will be able to get pregnant. This study will try to determine if these hormone levels can predict fertility and infertility.    ,NCT01028365

Healthy,Fit Over 45 - a Health Promotion Project for Inactive Female Hospital Staff Age 45+ From the University Hospital of Zürich, Background: Despite the well-known benefits of exercise 64% of the Swiss population do not fulfill the public health recommendation of physical activity. A survey of female staff members over 45 years of age from the University Hospital Zurich at the end of 2003 showed that physical inactivity is also prevalent in this population. Aim: To assess whether inactive women working at a large hospital centre prefer Nordic Walking (NW) or a Jogging (J) as a health promotion strategy. (2) To test whether the method chosen by the majority improves physical performance physical activity body weight and composition and bone mineral density. Methods: The investigators will send out a questionnaire to all female staff members at a large hospital centre age 45 and older ask whether they are inactive and whether they prefer Nordic Walking or Jogging as a health promotion strategy. Depending on the preference of the majority of the women the investigators will then ask inactive female staff members age 45+ to participate in a 12-months randomized controlled trial comparing training plus nutrition education to nutrition education alone. The training will have a 3-month building-up phase followed up by an in part unsupervised training of 9 months. All participants will receive a lecture on healthy nutrition once a months for 12 months. The investigators will assess diet with a food frequency questionnaire at baseline and after 12 and 24 months. The primary endpoint is: physical performance measured with the 12-minute Coopertest. The secondary endpoints are: level of physical activity body mass index body composition and bone mineral density at the spine and the hip. Importance: This project will address the questions which physical activities are preferred by inactive women and whether the preferred training improves physical performance physical activity body mass index body composition and bone mineral density. In addition our study will explore whether those women who changed their diet in addition to being randomized to the training group have an enhanced benefit.    ,NCT01033110

Healthy,Pilot Study on the Tolerability of Dietary Dried Plum, Dried plums (Prunus domestica L.) have traditionally been recognized for their health benefits related to conditions such as constipation irregular menstrual cycles and mouth sores. This dried fruit provides high levels of fiber vitamins and minerals. Dried plum has also been shown in animal studies to have beneficial effects on bone and can prevent the loss of bone caused by low hormone levels such as occurs after surgical removal of the ovaries. We also have shown that dried plum can prevent the loss of bone associated with aging in mice. Very few therapies for osteoporosis actually reverse bone loss and improve bone strength. The potential therapeutic value of dried plum in men and women with hormone deficiency or age-related osteoporosis is clear.    ,NCT01035372

Healthy,The Hemodynamic Response to Prolonged Dobutamine Infusion, A decrease in the response of beta 1 adrenergic receptors to agonists (desensitization) is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of diseases such as congestive heart failure. However currently there is no in vivo model that will enable us to measure desensitization of the hemodynamic responses to beta 1 adrenergic receptors in vivo. Our hypothesis is that constant 3 hours intravenous infusion of the selective beta1 adrenergic receptor agonist dobutamine will result in gradual decline in hemodynamic responses to dobutamine over time.    ,NCT01042873
Healthy,To Determine the Safety and Immunogenicity of an Oral Whole Cell ShanChol Cholera Vaccine in Bangladesh, Background: Severe dehydrating cholera due to V. cholerae O1 is an important public health problem in Bangladesh and many other developing countries. V. cholerae O1 is a major bacterial pathogen causing around 5 million cases and at least 200000 deaths in adults and children each year. It can be assumed that there are at least 300000 severe cases and 1.2 million infections in people in Bangladesh alone. The rate of cholera varies from around 1 to 8 per 1000 population and the highest attack rate is in children 2- to 9-year years of age . Cholera is now also being documented in very young children. Currently enteric vaccine approaches are regarded as the most accessible short term and practical means to prevent and control such illnesses to prevent disease and epidemics in resource poor settings with limited public health and sanitary facilities. An effective inactivated whole cell bivalent cholera vaccine against Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139 was produced and implemented for public health purposes in Vietnam since the 1990s. This bivalent vaccine has been found to be safe and to confer significant protection against El Tor cholera in both children and adults and has over the last decade being used in the Vietnam to protect against cholera. This vaccine has further been reformulated by the IVI to meet WHO requirements and is now being produced in WHO prequalified vaccine company in India. The reformulated vaccine has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in Indian children as well as adults. A large Phase III study of the vaccine has recently been carried out in Kolkata India in over 120000 participants aged from one year and above. Results of the study are encouraging and the vaccine gives over 60% protection against cholera. The vibriocidal antibody response rate was 80% in children and 53% in adults. Following this study the vaccine designated as ShanChol has been licensed in India in April 2009. The vaccine is now being marketed in India and is available at a cost affordable for developing country settings. Objective: The aim of the proposed study is to assess if the orally administered killed bivalent whole-cell cholera vaccine ShanChol will be safe and immunogenic in different age groups in Bangladesh in children and adults. Study design: This will be a randomized double blind placebo-controlled study on a total of 330 subjects 165 vaccine and 165 placebo recipients. The specific aims will be to determine: i) safety and determine adverse events if any (ii) determine immune responses. Relevance: The study of ShanChol on Bangladeshi children and adults will be able to give information regarding the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in Bangladeshi subjects. This information will be important for proceeding with larger studies in Bangladesh and if proven useful for introduction the cholera vaccine in the country in the future.    ,NCT01042951

Healthy,In-Vivo Bleeding Volume Test for Platelet-Aspirin Interaction, Purpose of the present research project is to study a new in-vivo test for abnormal platelet function and to study the effect of certain drugs on clinical bleeding. This is a randomized clinical trial of a new in-vivo test of platelet function known as the bleeding volume test(BVT)which relies on an on-line measurement system. This trial will assess the sensitivity and specificity of the new BVT by studying the effects of aspirin which is known to affect platelet function in-vivo. This is not a clinical trial of drugs. This is a clinical trial of a novel in-vivo on-line laboratory test. The BVT measures the total volume of blood in the discrete blotches of blood on the blotter paper during the BT test and thus the BVT gleans valuable additional information from the bleeding time test (BTT)procedure. We hypothesize that the BV test will be a more accurate specific and sensitive test for diagnosing platelet function abnormalities and for detecting a person's bleeding tendency compared to the BTT and commercially available in-vitro platelet function tests.    ,NCT01047722

Healthy,Safety Study of Inhaling Carbon Monoxide in Healthy Volunteers, Post operative ileus (POI) a temporary paralysis of the intestines is a serious health care problem. It normally occurs in all patients after surgery to the abdomen but in some cases can result in serious complications. The objective of this study is to determine if inhaling very low doses of carbon monoxide (CO) before and after colon surgery will shorten the duration of normal POI and/or prevent the development of POI complications in patients undergoing colon surgery. This preliminary study will be conducted in ten healthy volunteers to monitor for blood levels and adverse effects that occur at different durations of exposure of inhaled CO to establish a safe dose for patients in the main trial. For the main trial patients requiring surgery to their colon will be assigned randomly to receive one hour treatments of either CO or oxygen by face mask before and after their operation. We hypothesize that healthy volunteers will be able to tolerate 1 hour doses of 250 ppm of CO with minimal side effects. It is also anticipated that for each dose of CO administered the blood levels of CO will remain well under poisonous levels. Finally we anticipate blood levels of CO will return to baseline level within 24 hours following the last dose of CO.    ,NCT01050933

Healthy,Vitamin D Supplementation During Pregnancy and Bone Status in Children at Birth and at One Year of Age, Vitamin D deficiency is frequently reported in pregnant women despite recommendation of daily vitamin D supplementation of 400IU/d. Recent studies have shown that in the absence of sun exposure these doses are seldom able to achieve 25(OH)D optimal serum levels. We hypothesize that larger doses of vitamin D are needed to be supplemented to all women during pregnancy.

Healthy,Comparison of Ertapenem Distribution in the Muscle of Six Healthy Volunteers and Six Critically Ill Patients by Microdialysis, Ertapenem is an antibiotic that is highly bound to plasma protein (> 95%). The effects of this high protein binding on tissue distribution of antibiotics have been few evaluated yet. In this study two groups of subjects will be compared: 6 healthy volunteers and 6 critically ill patients (patients with infection due to an Ertapenem susceptible bacteria). Indeed these 2 populations show changes in binding capacity of drugs to plasma proteins due to a decrease of protidaemia and of the affinity of drugs to transport proteins. It seems therefore important to clarify the consequences of a modification in protein binding on distribution of antibiotics. That's why we have decided to characterize tissue distribution of ertapenem in healthy volunteers and critically ill patients by assessing: free and total concentrations in plasma and free concentrations in muscle by microdialysis.    ,NCT01061047
Healthy,Effects of Genotype on CYP2C9 Drug Interactions, This research study will help determine how a person's genetic makeup affects their responses to drugs the ability of the body to break down drugs and their potential to experience an interaction between drugs. We are investigating the drug interactions between an antifungal drug called fluconazole and the commonly used drugs tolbutamide flurbiprofen and ketoprofen. Tolbutamide is used for management of Type 2 diabetes. Both flurbiprofen and ketoprofen are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often used for arthritis or pain. We are interested in studying whether individuals with certain genetic profiles have different drug interactions than normal. This research is being done to see if certain genetic profiles require us to adjust medication doses differently than is needed for the general population. Genetic profiles of subjects are determined from their previous participation in the Pharmacogenetics Registry (Investigator Richard Brundage University of Minnesota). The study hypothesis is: Fraction metabolized by CYP2C9 enzyme determines the extent of drug interactions in CYP2C9*1/*1 individuals but this factor (fraction metabolized) becomes less influential and drug interactions are attenuated in a gene-dose dependent manner in individuals with one or more defective alleles.    ,NCT01061112

Healthy,Mechanical Load on the Shoulders While Carrying a Backpack- Towards a Knowledge-Based Backpack Design, Soldiers and recreational backpackers are often required to carry heavy loads on their body during military operations or hiking. Despite the advances in backpack design the loads carried by soldiers still impose an extreme physiological strain (soft tissue deformation) which frequently results in discomfort painmusculoskeletal injuries and loss sensorimotor function. In the current study characterization of the pressures evaluation of the deformations of the soft tissues specifically the fat muscles Brachial plexus and subclavian vessels applied on the shoulder while sitting with a heavy backpack will performed. The data acquired in the current trials will be used for development of a finite element (FE) 3D shoulder model. The purpose is to better understand the mechanical loads that are being transferred to the underlying tissue below the shoulder straps during walking/marching with a backpack. During the 2nd phase of this project data collected during this research will be used to develop gear that will alleviate the strain on the shoulders prevent injury and enhance performance. Hypothesis   -  High focal strain (hot-spots) on the shoulder tissue that are observed with the pressure mapping will be observed also in the MR scans.   -  The strain at those hot-spots can be reduced by personal-geometry adjusted straps. Volunteers Five young (18-30 yrs) healthy and fit males will participate in this study. Trials design   1. MR Scans- The scan will be performed for analysis of personal shoulder anatomy and will be used for developing a 3D FE model. The sagittal view will be used to develop the 3D model. The coronal and axial sectional views will be used to assess the deformations applied on the shoulder tissue. The scan will then be repeated while carrying a 25 kg standard commercial backpack while sitting in the same position for the assessment of shoulder girdle tissues deformations. Time estimation for each scan is 40 min (80 min total). The subjects are not required to carry the backpack prior to those scans.   2. Static pressure measurement- each volunteer will be asked to sit for 30 seconds while carrying the 25 kg backpack. During this session pressure will be measured using a pressure mapping pad (Sensor Products Inc. USA) placed between the shoulder strap and the underlying tissue. The maximal total participation time of each volunteer will be 2 hours total (inside and outside the MR). Data acquired in the current trials will be used for the development of a FE (finite element) 3D shoulder model. MR scans will be utilized for composing geometry and for the boundary conditions assessment (strain magnitude). Pressure measurements will be used as boundary conditions (stress magnitude). MR scans and pressure measurements will be performed in the Sheba medical center facilities.    ,NCT01066975

The objective of this study was to evaluate the satiety response of scFOS and its ability to decrease food intake.    ,NCT01100788
Healthy,Effectiveness of the Dual Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor Desvenlafaxine Succinate in Healthy Volunteers, DVS is the main metabolite of the antidepressant/anxiolytic medication Venlafaxine (Effexor). Like parent compound DVS is an antidepressant inhibiting both serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake. However no studies to date describe the in vivo potency of this drug on monoamines reuptake. Consequently it appears essential to determine the potency of DVS in human subjects using a wide dose range in order to determine at which dose(s) it starts inhibiting 5-HT and NE reuptake. The investigators are interested in learning whether there is a gender difference in the dose of the study medication at which NE reuptake inhibition occurs.    ,NCT01101152

Healthy,Food-related Differences in Human Metabolite Profiles, Many population studies include food questionnaires (recording the normal food intake or the food intake of the study day). This is necessary because diet is an important lifestyle factor although food questionnaires are time-consuming and expensive. Moreover mis-reporting is a very common problem. We therefore seek for a tool to validate food protocol. The hypothesis is to find biochemical marker for animal protein fruit intake and grape consumption in urinary metabolic profiles after specific food consumption. Furthermore we want to specify biomarkers for different animal protein sources fish and beef.    ,NCT01102049
Healthy,Human Urinary Biomarker for Orange Juice Consumption, Human urinary metabolic profiling showed to be very successful to elucidate biomarkers linked to geographic origin and specific food consumption patterns (Holmes and Loo et al.: Human metabolic phenotype diversity and its association with diet and blood pressure.

Healthy,Understanding the Persistence of Immunity After MenC Vaccines, Neisseria meningitidis occurs worldwide as endemic disease1 and is a major cause of invasive infections such as meningitis and septicaemia. Three protein-polysaccharide conjugate serogroup C meningococcal (MenC) vaccines were developed in the late 1990's and an accelerated programme of clinical trials in the UK led to licensure of these MenC vaccines in 1999 and these vaccines were introduced into the routine infant immunisation schedule at 2 3 and 4 months. However children who were aged 1-18 years in 2000 only received a single dose of a MenC conjugate vaccine during the mass immunisation campaign. Previous studies have demonstrated rapid waning of MenC specific antibody concentrations and serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) titres following immunisation in young children. A cross-sectional review on rates of sero-protection against MenC disease in the UK has demonstrated that the majority of children who were immunised with a single dose of a MenC conjugate vaccine between the ages of 1-10 did not have protective titres of MenC SBA 7 years after the immunisation campaign. As this cohort of children reaches adolescence there is a risk of increased transmission of the organism and a resurgence of meningococcal disease in children who do not have protective levels of antibody. There is thus a need to conduct a study evaluating the changes in MenC SBA titres over time in children who received a single dose of a MenC vaccine in early childhood which is the main objective of this study.    ,NCT01126996
Healthy,Effect of Prolonged Military Exercises With High Load Carriage on Neuromuscular Fatigue and Physiological/Biomechanical Responses," Land military missions generally combine prolonged walking/moderate-pace-running and other physical actions such as creeping jumping shooting??which are associated with the direct carrying of high to severe loads of equipment and supplies (20-30 to 50 kg) by soldiers. For an infantry section ""typical"" intervention phases last about 20-24 h and combine variable intensity grades. Consequently military mission characteristics are an interesting investigation field of human fatigue.

Healthy,Comparison of the Protective Effect of Desflurane and Propofol in Patients With Renal Transplantation," Ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury is the major cause of early renal dysfunction and acute renal failure of the transplanted kidney after renal transplantation. In 1986 Murry et al. described the phenomenon ""ischemic preconditioning"". Also it was reported that a few non-ischemic stimuli could provide cellular tolerance against major ischemia through a mechanism similar to ischemic preconditioning. In an animal study 1 minimal alveolar concentration of volatile anesthetics - a clinically relevant concentration - was reported to have a protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury the effect being variable between types of anesthetics. Also there were somm reports that intravenous anesthetics such as propofol could reduce IR injury by decreasing oxidative stress and apoptosis. By reducing the ischemia/reperfusion injury of the grafted kidney the morbidity and mortality related to renal transplantation can be reduced as well. The objective of this study is to find out whether according to the type of anesthetics (Desflurane vs. Propofol) there is a difference in the protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury of the grafted kidney in patients receiving renal transplantation.

Healthy,Factors Controlling the Formation of Salivary Films, The aim of this study is to determine how different ingredients which are found in food and other consumer products affect the ability of saliva to form surface films. Saliva forms a protective film on the surfaces inside the mouth. This film affects the way we consume and digest food and protects our teeth and other surfaces inside the mouth from disease and decay. It is not well known how this film forms or which components in everyday life affect formation of the film and therefore its protective properties. Samples of saliva will be collected from apparently healthy volunteers. The properties of the film (thickness density strength protein composition) will be studied in the laboratory under controlled conditions. The effects of common ingredients in foods and other products such as proteins emulsifiers preservatives and surfactants on the formation and properties of the film will be determined. The results of this study will help us to understand how different ingredients can change the properties of saliva that may affect the way that we sense and digest food and the ability of saliva to protect against decay and infection. This could in the future lead to new ideas for developing:healthy foods (e.g. lower fat) that taste better or more effective dental care products.    ,NCT01167504

We have developed a method of labelling human cells with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ""contrast agent"" which contains tiny iron filings. Following intravenous administration it is possible to see where the iron-labelled cells have gone using MRI scanning. We would like to do is to demonstrate that these cells behave normally and migrate to a site of inflammation. We plan to induce an area of inflammation in the forearm of healthy volunteers using the Mantoux test (a test of immunity against tuberculosis) before giving the labelled cells intravenously. After the Mantoux test we will give these volunteers iron-labelled cells and do MRI scans of their forearm to determine whether these cells can be seen accumulating in the target site.

Healthy,The Possible Influence of Health Promotion Coaching on Health Related and Organizational Outcomes Among Nurses, Strong evidence shows that physical activity (PA) has favorable psychological and health related outcomes. However most employees do not perform enough PA to achieve health and well being benefits. Worksite interventions aimed at improving PA often yield modest effect sizes and their theoretical ground is not profound. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) is a novel comprehensive theoretical model for health behavior change that hasn't been studied as a whole in a worksite intervention study. The objectives of the proposed study are:   1. To develop a coaching-based group intervention that will be both grounded in theory (HAPA) as well as applicable.   2. To evaluate the feasibility of conducting this intervention among employed hospital nurses using a randomized controlled design interviews and other evaluation procedures. The proposed study will offer the most comprehensive empirical test to date of the full HAPA model.    ,NCT01172834

Healthy,Resveratrol and Midazolam Metabolism, Adverse events due to drug-drug and/or herb-drug interactions are of serious concern and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Resveratrol is a polyphenol antioxidant that has been identified in over 70 species and is suggested to be the constituent in red wine responsible for cardioprotective effects. The potential health benefits of resveratrol supplements are highly extolled in the alternative medicine industry and daily doses are up to 5 grams are being studied. While there are potential health benefits of high doses of resveratrol for patients taking other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 such as transplant medications chemotherapies and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors there may be a clinically significant herb-drug interaction. We the investigators have shown in vitro that resveratrol is a mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Based on our in vitro evidence and literature reports of the pharmacokinetics of resveratrol we hypothesize that resveratrol will be a potent in vivo mechanism-based inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4 enzymes. To date there are no clinical studies that address the potential for a resveratrol-drug interaction. We propose to test whether single and multiple doses of resveratrol alter the pharmacokinetics of midazolam a prototypic CYP3A4 probe drug.    ,NCT01173640

Healthy,Role of Endogenous Estrogen in Growth-Hormone Regulation in Postmenopausal Women, Participants are being asked to take part in this research study to learn why growth hormone(GH) levels decline when estrogen production falls at the time of menopause. GH is a hormone released from the pituitary gland that affects bone muscle and fat. Estrogen is a female hormone. Doctors believe that lower estrogen is one of the reasons that GH diminishes in postmenopausal women. However estrogen does not fall completely. This raises the question whether the little bit of estrogen that is left is doing anything. Lack of GH makes bones thinner muscles weaker and fat stores larger. To learn whether the low amount of the body's own estrogen maintains GH secretion after menopause the investigators need to stop any estrogen you might be taking and then partially block the effect if any of your own estrogen. The investigators will use a new estrogen-blocking drug (fulvestrant). Fulvestrant(which also goes by the tradename Faslodex) was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat breast cancer. Fulvestrant is being used in a non-FDA approved manner in this study (not to treat breast cancer but to study the effect on Growth Hormone secretion). The drug interferes with how estrogen works in the body except in the brain. The study that you are considering now tests whether your own estrogen works outside the brain to maintain GH secretion in postmenopausal women. This concept is important because the brain controls how the pituitary gland secretes GH.    ,NCT01186796

Healthy,Cheek Cells - Non-invasive Fatty Acid Status Marker, Various biological materials have been investigated to determine dietary fatty acid intakes such as plasma erythrocytes and adipose tissue. The applied techniques are invasive sampling methods and may have limitations in studies involving infants or young children. In 1985 the group of McMurchie suggested buccal cheek cells as a marker for dietary fatty acid intake; however fatty acid profiling in cheek cells has not been widely used yet. In a clinical intervention trial a new method will be tested. The study will consist of two consecutive parts: A) a correlation study will investigate the relationship between established fatty acid markers (red blood cells (RBC) plasma) and the newly proposed markers (cheek cells) before and after intervention B) an intervention study will investigate the time depended implementation and steady state of docosahexaenoic acid DHA in plasma RBC and cheek cells. The participants will receive 520 mg DHA daily over a period of 30 days. Blood and cheek cell samples will be collected once prior to study commencement and regularly during intervention. The proposed study aims at verifying cheek cell analysis results as a non-invasive marker for fatty acid profiling. This will be shown by correlation analyses of fatty acids in cheek cells erythrocytes and plasma phospholipids. Furthermore the time kinetics of DHA incorporation into cheek cells will clarify if cheek cell fatty acids can be considered as a short or long term marker. The new non-invasive method is expected to be extremely valuable as a non-invasive approach for studying the fatty acid profile in human including infants and young children. Therefore it is of great interest to validate the new method in a clinical trial.    ,NCT01192269

Healthy,Metabolomics of Aging: Sub-study of the Healthy Elderly Active Longevity (HEAL) Study, This research is being done to learn more about healthy aging. We hope to learn which bodily processes or functions are important for the elderly to maintain good health. Metabolites (for example glucose) are small molecules in our bodies that are used in all bodily reactions. Looking at their levels in healthy elderly people may help researchers find out which processes lead some people to get to disease and others to not. Metabolites are the basic building blocks for people. They are used to construct larger complexes(such as proteins) relay signals from one part of the body to another and as a source of energy. While most people have essentially the same types of metabolites the relative levels of these metabolites vary from one individual to another. These levels reflect the body's state of growth development and reproduction. An appropriate balance in metabolites is important to maintaining general health. Conditions like cancer and diabetes result in disrupted levels of metabolites that are associated with changes in bodily functions. Deviations from normal levels of metabolites can be used as a signature for disease. Researchers have discovered that a disruption in unique metabolite levels is associated with human aging. In this study we hope to learn which if any of these disruptions are associated with the onset of age-related disease.    ,NCT01209884

Healthy,Technique Optimization With Whole-body Diffusion-weighted MRI, Whole body diffusion-weighted imaging is a functional magnetic resonance imaging technique that characterizes tissue by probing changes in water diffusion secondary to differences in the tissue microstructure. These changes in water diffusion result in differences in signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images that are quantified with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). In malignant lesions the extravascular extracellular space (EES) will be diminished due to the increased number of cells. This will restrict water diffusion identified by increased signal intensity (SI) on native diffusion-weighted images and low ADC. Contrary in tissue with low cellularity like benign lesions and treatment induced necrosis the EES will be enlarged due to the lower density of cells or in case of necrosis the complete absence of cellular organization. This will facilitate water diffusion leading to absent SI on native diffusion-weighted images and high ADC. The purpose of this study is to image anatomy and lymph nodes in healthy volunteers with whole body diffusion-weighted imaging. This way maps of normal anatomy can be created on the whole body diffusion-weighted images which can be used as a reference in further studies with patients scanned with the same whole body diffusion-weighted imaging scan protocol. A group of 30 healthy volunteers will receive a whole body diffusion-weighted imaging scan on a 3 Tesla T-MRI system. A total scan session will take about 30 minutes. Contrast administration is not required and patients will not be exposed to radiation.    ,NCT01231282

Healthy,Tolerability Study of the Application of a 3M Microstructure Transdermal System," The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an experimental device that introduces microscopic channels into the skin. Creating microscopic channels in the skin allows for better absorption of various medications applied to the skin and this study will determine if the study device offers a tolerable method by which to introduce these holes. The study population will include 54 individuals ages 18-74 years old with a roughly equal distribution of skin colors. Each subject will have a total of three visits 24 hours apart from one another. The study device will be applied at the Baseline and Day 1 visits. At various timepoints before and after device application skin assessments for irritation will be completed using a 7-point Skin Reaction Scale and photographs will be taken. Subjects will report pain associated with device application using a standardized pain scale. At the baseline visit a member of the research staff will administer applications of the study device on the side of the subject's forehead temple and the area below and to the side of the nose on randomly selected sides of the face. The side of the face at each location not receiving application of the study device will receive applications of a ""dummy"" device. Subjects will not be informed of which device is the study device and which is the ""dummy"" device. At the Day 1 visit a member of the research staff will administer study device applications to the center of the subject's forehead. The subject will also self-apply the study device to the chin under the instruction of the research staff member. At the Day 2 visit final skin assessments will be made and the subject will be evaluated and treated for any persistent skin irritation. Differences in skin irritation between sites of study device application and ""dummy"" device application will be determined as well as several other endpoints.    ",NCT01257763
Healthy,Secondary Analysis of Gut Hormones and Inflammatory Cytokines in Fasting Subjects, The original study executed between 2002-2004 was an interventional trial in which 20 healthy normal-weight female subjects were randomized to a four-day fast plus daily subcutaneous injections of leptin or a four day fast plus daily subcutaneous injections of a placebo. The primary endpoints were gonadotropin pulsatility TSH secretion and thyroid function and cortisol secretion. The current study is a secondary analysis focussed on the placebo group which underwent a four-day fast. The study is looking at the effects of fasting on gut-derived hormones and inflammatory markers in healthy normal-weight women. The hypothesis for this secondary analysis was that four days of fasting would augment levels of orexigenic gut-derived hormones and suppress levels of anorexigenic gut-derived horomones while suppressing secretion of inflammatory cytokines.    ,NCT01257841

Healthy,Youth Lifestyle Intervention With Food and Exercise, Children who are overweight or obese can develop many health complications including diabetes high blood pressure high cholesterol and they break their bones more often than children who are of healthy body weights. Recent short-term studies in children suggest that increasing milk intake for 16 weeks begins to improve body composition and also reduces risk of developing diabetes. However no study has been long enough to truly test for the benefits of high milk consumption on these conditions including bone. Both dietary and activity approaches to reducing obesity in children are suggested by health professionals and when combined are called lifestyle interventions. Therefore McGill University has designed a 1-year intervention study focused on lifestyle improvements to reduce obesity in children 6 to 12 years of age. A control group will be monitored for the year while two other groups will receive lifestyle interventions with standard recommended (2 servings a day) and high (4 servings a day) intakes of milk. The intervention will include 6 planning sessions to increase intakes of vegetables fruits and milks along with more activity and less time watching television or using computerized games. Children will have muscle and fat measured using an x-ray device that also measures bone at the beginning middle and end of the study. They will also have a small blood sample taken every 3 months to measure blood sugar cholesterol and some nutrients. Changes over the study will demonstrate the benefits of lifestyle and milk interventions.    ,NCT01290016

Healthy,Metabolic Phenotyping in Humans," Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global burden disease affecting almost 200 million people and is expected to nearly double by 2030 (1). It is imperative that this disease is kept under control and that we begin to reverse the direction of its incidence. We propose to start by identifying the physiological and molecular aspects of the problem in all spectrums of the disease (ie from insulin sensitive athletes to sedentary lean and obese individuals and further to overt type 2 diabetics) and focus our efforts on examining the differences and identifying the stages of progression for possible targets of future intervention. The proposed study ""Metabolic Phenotyping"" is novel in its target populations and innovative in its use of state-of-the-art techniques. We hypothesize that the in vivo differences in metabolic flexibility and mitochondrial function between endurance athletes and type 2 diabetics and their lean and obese controls are retained in vitro and will offer a new model in which to study the underlying mechanisms of the progression of T2D.

Healthy,Comparison of the Efficacy of an Integrative-kinesiological to a Cognitive-behavioural Intervention, Stress is a common problem with significant consequences for health. It can be a trigger for somatic diseases as well as psychological disorders and leads through missed working days and healthcare cost to a high economic loss. It is for health and economic reasons essential to develop and evaluate effective interventions that can inoculate against stress and build inner strength. A cognitive-behavioural training for groups that is well evaluated and has shown to be effective is the Stress-Inoculation-Training by Meichenbaum. As the public utilization of methods of the complementary and alternative medicine is increasing a rigorous evaluation is needed. Integrative Kinesiology is a popular method that has been said to be effective against stress and its symptoms. The investigators propose a randomized controlled evaluation and comparison of the interventions to each other and to a waiting-list control group. Hypothesis: Healthy volunteers attending a two dayseminar will show significantly reduced psychobiological reactivity decreased stress perception and less anxiety to a standardized psychosocial stress test compared to the waiting list group. A total of 64 healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups. The efficacy of the interventions will be measured through the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to measure the psychobiological stress reactivity.    ,NCT01331577

Healthy,Choroidal Thickness During Changes in Intraocular Pressure and Arterial Blood Pressure, Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma are among the leading causes of blindness in the western world. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a well known major risk factor for glaucoma. In addition there is growing evidence that vascular factors including arterial hypertension and hypotension may play a role in the pathogenesis of AMD and glaucoma. To gain more insight into these mechanisms in humans is the primary goal of the present study. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) delivers three dimensional volumetric reflectivity information through transparent media in vivo. Moreover the images show a high choroidal penetration and a resolution comparable to an histologic examination when infrared light sources are used. Because of its non-invasive character OCT provides an ideal method for diagnosis and monitoring of retinal and choroidal abnormalities. The present study aims to investigate whether choroidal thickness is temporarily altered by changes in IOP or systemic hemodynamic parameters. IOP will be increased by the use of a suction cup technique mean arterial blood pressure will be altered by intravenously administered Phenylephrine or Sodium-Nitroprusside.    ,NCT01333891

Healthy,Biodiesel Exhaust Acute Vascular and Endothelial Responses, Exposure to particulate air pollution has been shown to increase cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and in previous controlled exposure studies has been shown to have acute cardiovascular and respiratory effects. The last decade has seen an unprecedented drive towards finding a bioeconomical and renewable source of fuel in order to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Although both biodiesel and bioethanol have emerged as contenders for future fuels biodiesel remains as the strongest contender within European markets. In 2007 researchers at the EPA released a commentary which concluded that the assumed correlation between the chemical composition of biodiesel exhaust and a reduction in health effects was only hypothetical. They suggested that there was a clear need for the study of health effects in humans regarding biofuel exhaust. In this project the investigators aim to investigate the cardiovascular respiratory and inflammatory responses to biofuel exhaust exposure in healthy volunteers.    ,NCT01337882

Healthy,Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of CW002," The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of an investigational neuromuscular blocking agent called CW002 and to document its effects on healthy adult volunteers. A neuromuscular blocking agent is a drug that temporarily prevents muscles from moving. CW002 has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Usually neuromuscular blocking agents are used together with other drugs that put people completely ""asleep"". These drugs allow doctors to place a breathing tube in the airway stop muscles from moving during surgical operations and allow ventilation (movement of air). This research is being done because CW002 is expected to act quickly and to provide a muscle block of intermediate (not too long not too short) duration. The researchers would like to test increasing doses of CW002 that can be given without causing severe side effects. If shown to be both safe and effective such a compound would be useful in surgical procedures and could improve future anesthetic care.    ",NCT01338935

Healthy,Using Magnetic Resonance (MR) to Understand the Effect of Erythromycin on Bowel Motility, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has proven to be a valuable imaging technique for suspected small bowel disease. This technique depends in part on adequate distension of the small bowel. This is accomplished by administering large volumes of a non-absorbable oral contrast material prior to the examination which typically produces excellent distension of the distal small bowel and stomach but poor distension of the proximal small bowel. Erythromycin is a common antibiotic that is known to promote stomach emptying and is used to treat diabetics with gastroparesis (poor stomach emptying.) The hypothesis of this study was that erythromycin will increase gastric emptying and hence improve small and large intestinal distention during MRI.    ,NCT01379183

Healthy,Investigation Drug-drug Interaction Between Dabigatran and Clarithromycin, Dabigatran (Pradaxa ®) is a new oral anticoagulant. It is used to prevent venous thromboembolism in orthopedic surgery and has recently demonstrated efficacy and safety at least as good as anticoagulants in the prevention of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation and the treatment of venous thromboembolism. It is administered with fixed dose and does not require laboratory monitoring because of the low inter and intra individual pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of dabigatran. However the bioavailability of dabigatran is very low (6.5%) and is controlled by an efflux protein P-GP. This molecule has a genetic polymorphism. The inhibition of this protein can cause a significant increase in intestinal absorption of dabigatran and expose patients to a risk of bleeding by overdose. Two major drug interactions have been identified : quinidine (cons-indication) and amiodarone (precautions). It is likely that other interactions exist and can be clinically significant in patients not selected such as testing. The development of tools to study the influence of P-GP on the PK and PD of dabigatran is therefore interesting. As the P-GP has a genetic polymorphism the study of the latter is an important element in the detection of drug interactions. In this sense clarithromycin a potent inhibitor of P-GP is a good model to evaluate the primary mechanism of drug interaction of dabigatran and optimize the experimental design of studies to be conducted.    ,NCT01385683

Healthy,The Molecular Basis for a Broad Range of Phenotypes Related to hTAS2R38, This single-site within-subject experimental study is designed to test the hypothesis that individuals express taste receptors differently and have different sensitivities to bitter taste samples which results from uneven expression. Subjects will include 100 racially and ethnically diverse healthy adults. All subjects will provide saliva samples for genetic analysis and undergo taste testing with common psychophysical stimuli. From the pool of 100 subjects 36 subjects from the common heterozygous group (PAV/AVI) and two from each homozygous group (AVI/AVI nontaster and PAV/PAV taster) will be invited to return for two additional sessions. During both sessions the investigators will 1) measure bitterness thresholds for PROP a common psychophysical stimulus; 2) measure bitterness perception of several vegetables; 3) obtain a saliva sample and 4) collect taste papillae. The investigators will then isolate DNA and RNA from the taste papillae and isolate DNA from saliva to evaluate molecular differences over time and between individuals and how it relates to taste psychophysics. All psychophysical and cellular measurements will be done during both sessions so that the investigators can determine how much variation is observed over a one-week time period in both cellular phenotype and psychophysical phenotype.    ,NCT01399944
Healthy,Comparison of the Pharmacokinetics of Three Generic Medications and Their Respective Brand Preparations, Generic describes a pharmaceutical product that does not have a brand name or trademark. Generic medications should be the equivalent of brand medications. Only their price should be different. The active ingredient of the generic medication has to be within a window of 80 to 125% of the original in the blood. There are reports that this standard is not always followed after the medication has been on the market. Indeed it was observed that some patients previously stable on original medications relapsed when switched to a generic. Several factors could account for this problem. Such problems have been reported for Pindolol Quetiapine and Trazodone. Some properties of specific brands of the generics and the original brands will be examined for these three medications. The three original medications used in this study are the Visken the Seroquel and the Desyrel. The three generics are the Teva-pindolol the Teva-Quetiapine and the Teva-Trazodone. They are all available on the Canadian market by prescription.    ,NCT01400165
Healthy,Bioavailability of Chlorogenic and Phenolic Acids From Soluble Coffees, Coffee contributes to a large extent to our daily intake of phenolic compounds which have been associated with potential health benefits.

The vaccine will be delivered via electroporation (EP) which uses the CELLECTRA constant current device to deliver a small electric charge following injection since animal studies have shown that this delivery method increases the immune response to vaccine. The vaccine will be given to up 30 healthy adult subjects who have participated in study FLU-001. It is hypothesized that a booster dose with INO-3401 + EP will be well tolerated and immunogenic.    ,NCT01403155
Healthy,Bioavailability of Two Doses of cogniVida??With One Dose of Rebaudioside A in Healthy Male Subjects, The purpose of the study is to examine the bioavailability of cogniVida??in 10 healthy male subjects after consumption of two different doses of cogniVida??(50 mg and 100 mg) and to compare the plasma values with values obtained in subjects receiving rebaudioside A (303.68 mg).

Healthy,Safety of A Group A C Polysaccharide Meningococcal and Type b Haemophilus Influenzal Conjugate Vaccine in Children, Haemophilus influenzae is an important pathogen which can cause primary infection and respiratory viral infection in infants and leaded to secondary infections. The infection of haemophilus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children. At present the developed conjugant Hib vaccine is proved to be safe and effective 90-99% of children will produce antibody of protection after 3 doses. Because Hib vaccine can prevent meningitis pneumonia epiglottis inflammation and other serious infection caused by Hib bacteria the WHO suggested that Hib vaccine should be included in the infant's normal immune programming. Since the use of meningitis aureus polysaccharide vaccine incidence of a disease in recent years is declined and maintain to the level of 0.5 per 1/100 thousand. But meningitis aureus polysaccharide vaccine with a relatively poor immune response in the infants under the age of two and the remaining 60% with a low antibody level and a short duration. According to the present immunization schedule to reach the median level of antibody levels there are at least 4 doses in need. So it is meaningful to improving vaccine immunogenicity to provide high levels of long-term protection and to reduce the number of injections. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the group A C polysaccharide meningococcal and type b haemophilus Influenzal Conjugate vaccine.    ,NCT01406509
Healthy,Efficacy of Bitter Blockers on Taste Perception in Children and Adults," This proposal describes 2 basic research studies that will be conducted sequentially. Study 1 will test the efficacy of both classic and newly developed ""generally recognized as a safe"" (GRAS) bitter blockers on the perceived bitterness and acceptance of different classes of bitter-tasting compounds by children and compare their responses to adults. Because variations among and between children and adults in terms of sensitivity to different bitter compounds are due in part to genetically determined receptor variation the investigators will consider genotype when assessing how well bitter blockers perform. In Study 2 the investigators aim to evaluate different methods (forced-choice procedures hedonic face scales) used for testing children to determine their reliability and reproducibility.

Healthy,Assessment of Inspiratory Profiles Through Airflow Resistances Designed to Mimic Inhalers, It is hypothesized that different inhalation profiles (inhalation flow rate versus time curves) result from different forms of patient training. Furthermore significant inter-subject variability in these profiles should exist that can under some circumstances depend on the design of different inhalation devices; this is because dry powder inhalers have different airflow resistances. The investigators also hypothesize that the spread of flow rate versus time profiles for inhalation can be collected. Finally these profiles can be analyzed from a group of human subjects and used to define a mean and statistical range of inhalation flow rate versus time curves. The investigators propose to collect the inhalation profiles from 20 'inhaler naïve' healthy volunteers after they have (a) read a typical inhaler package insert and (b) been formally trained in inhaler use by a pharmacist. No drug exposure will occur. The data will be used from this pilot study to (a) show the inter-subject variability in the inhalation profiles used by adults inhaling through realistic airflow resistances (like those in inhalers) following different types of training (b) show how formal training changes inhalation technique and (c) provide a database of typical inspiratory profiles for use and improvement of realistic tests of inhalers in the laboratory. Since pulmonary deposition from inhalers greatly depends upon the way patients inhale through them this research will result in a database to improve the design and in vitro characterization of inhalers.    ,NCT01410877

Healthy,Accuracy of the O2 MedTech PMS-3000 Monitor, A cerebral oximeter is a device that uses light to measure the amount of oxygen within the brain. It is similar to the device that measures the level of oxygen in the tip of the finger known as a pulse oximeter. The cerebral oximeter consists of a sensor placed on the forehead that both emits and detects the amount of light absorbed. This study will determine how accurate the device is by comparing the displayed value on the monitor with blood samples taken simultaneously from the arterial blood in the wrist and venous blood in the neck. In order to test the device over a suitable range the level of oxygen within the blood will be reduced in a controlled manner by reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration. This is the equivalent of ascending to an altitude of 16000 feet. The study will be conducted in healthy volunteers.    ,NCT01418079
Healthy,Relation of Diet to Heart Disease Risk Factors in Children, Metabolites of dietary phosphatidylcholine- choline and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)- were recently identified as being associated with myocardial infarction in a case-control study. The latter TMAO is a gut-microflora-derived choline metabolite that has been shown to be a potent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This pilot study seeks to use information derived from a dietary questionnaire in children to test the association of dietary choline intake to plasma levels of TMAO as well as the relationship between plasma choline levels and components of atherogenic dyslipidemia (increased triglycerides and small LDL and reduced HDL cholesterol). An ancillary goal of this study is to build on existing programs of community outreach to local Oakland/Berkeley minority communities and to develop an infrastructure for family-based and community participation in clinical research across the full age spectrum and among diverse populations. This pilot study will examine the association of dietary choline intake assessed by food frequency questionnaires to biomarkers of CVD risk in 40 children (> 7 years of age) and their parents as there is no information regarding this relationship in children. The results of this pilot study will form the basis for a proposal to carry out a randomized intervention trial to directly test the effects of dietary choline intake on plasma TMAO and lipoprotein levels. Ultimately better understanding of the relationship between dietary choline intake and CVD risk factors may facilitate the formulation of appropriate dietary choline recommendations in children and adults.    ,NCT01418196

Healthy,Evaluation of Postural Control After Exercise in Athletes Using Tetra Axial Posturography (tetrax1), Tetra-ataxiametric posturography is based on the measurement and computerized elaboration of electronic signals emitted by four footplates one for each heel and toe respectively. These are sensitive to vertical pressure produced by a subject standing straight but in various positions (feet parallel in tandem eyes closed on pads etc.). The method yields additional parameters not obtained by the traditional monoplate stabilometers namely weight-distribution patterns and correlation among six combinations of paired outputs from the two heels two toes heel/toe of each foot and the two diagonals (tetra-ataxiametric synchronizations). Most athletic injuries occur at the end of an activity when the participant is fatigue. It is likely that significant portion of the injuries result from instability of the lower extremity joints as a consequence of fatigue of the stabilizing muscles. Muscle fatigue increase postural sway impaired muscle control and increase the onset delay of movement. Comparing pre-exercise with post-exercise results for each athlete should detect significant and clinically meaningful differences with the Tetra-ataxiametric measures of stability interaction between Fourier Spectral Power Ranges of body sway weight distributions and synchronizations of toe parts. The method is suitable for young subjects and the equipment is portable and tests can be conveniently carried out in a child's familiar training setting and right before/after exercise. The goal of the present study is to measure the balance of the athletes after different types of exercises to measure the ability of the athletes to recover different types of exercises and to measure the influence of increasing physical fitness on balance ability. Fifty basketball and football players between the ages of 12 and 18 years old will be examined following informed consent from the children and their legal guardian. Each participant would be measured three times during the year (pre-season middle-season and post-season) three times each (before-training after aerobic warming-up and after-training) on the Tetrax. Additionally physical parameters (as height and weight) anatomical parameters (as leg length) and joint range of movement would be record.    ,NCT01433341
Healthy,Evaluation of Circulating Osteogenic Factors in Trauma Patients, Bone fractures in traumatic brain-injured and spinal cord-injured patients often heal faster than in other patients. However such patients are also occasionally prone to bone formation in soft tissues such as muscle. This process is called heterotopic ossification and tends to occur around joints. Patients with heterotopic ossification often suffer from complications such nerve compression ankylosis chronic pain osteoporosis and infections. Loss of movement can also interfere with function and the quality of life of patients already experiencing difficulties associated with their trauma. Positioning transfers and hygiene become difficult and even impossible which worsens the loss of autonomy. Previous research has suggested that an osteoinductive factor (which has the capacity to induce the formation of bone) may be released into the bloodstream following a head or spinal cord injury. The investigators laboratory has shown that a growth factor called BMP-9 when injected into a damaged mouse muscle has the ability to cause strong ossification in damaged muscle. The investigators would like to find out whether the levels of BMP-9 and/or its receptor (which is called ALK1) increase after traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries that occur at the same time as serious orthopaedic traumas. The main goal of the investigators study is thus to determine whether BMP-9 levels increase in the serum of trauma patients.    ,NCT01433536

Healthy,Pharmacogenetics of Warfarin Induction and Inhibition, This research study will help determine how a person's genetic makeup affects their response to drugs the ability of the body to break down drugs and their potential to experience an interaction between drugs. The investigators are investigating the drug interactions with the commonly used anticoagulant drug called warfarin. Warfarin is used for the treatment and prevention of life-threatening abnormal blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis heart attacks and strokes. The investigators chose warfarin for this study because it is a commonly used drug and must be monitored closely to avoid side effects. The investigators are interested in studying whether individuals with certain genetic profiles react differently to warfarin when it is combined with other drugs. This research is being done to see if certain genetic profiles require us to adjust warfarin doses differently than is needed for the general population. Genetic profiles of subjects are determined from their participation in the Pharmacogenetics Registry study (investigator Richard Brundage University of Minnesota). The study hypothesis is: Functionally defective CYP2C9 alleles attenuate the warfarin-fluconazole inhibitory interaction and exacerbate the warfarin-rifampin inductive interaction.    ,NCT01447511

Healthy,Effects of FODMAPs on Small Bowel Water Content: an MRI Study," Some carbohydrates particularly fructose the sugar found in fruit and bread may cause bloating pain and erratic bowel habits (diarrhoea and constipation) particularly in patients suffering from the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This may be because they are not well absorbed in the small intestine and cause water to be trapped in the bowel causing distension. Studies have shown that reducing the amount of these sugars in the diet can relieve these symptoms. There is some evidence that combining fructose and glucose can reduce the symptoms caused by fructose but just why is unclear. In this study the investigators will use a non invasive medical imaging technique called ""magnetic resonance imaging"" (or MRI) to look at the behaviour of drinks containing these sugars in the bowels of healthy human volunteers. The investigators will give four different drinks: one beverage consisting of a very well absorbed sugar glucose another consisting of the less well absorbed sugar fructose a third which is a mixture of glucose and fructose and a fourth consisting of several fructose subunits joined together (called fructan). The investigators will take MRI images of the stomach and intestines at intervals for 5 hours and compare these with the feelings of distension and bloating in our volunteers. The results will act as control for subsequent studies in IBS patients and these may help design diets to reduce symptoms in IBS.    ",NCT01459406

Healthy,Effects of Voriconazole on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Oral Buprenorphine: A Two-phase Cross-over Study in Healthy Subjects, Variability in drug response can be due to either pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic factors. The reasons why people differ in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics are manifold and include e.g. genetic factors diseases age and concomitantly administered drugs. Oxidation reactions are dominant in the metabolism of drugs and cytochrome P-450 enzymes (CYP) have been recognized as chief contributors (Guengerich 1992). We have previously shown that drug interactions mediated by the inhibition of CYP enzymes may be of major clinical significance (Olkkola et al. 1993; Olkkola et al. 1994; Varhe et al. 1994; Olkkola et al. 1999; Palkama et al. 1999; Jokinen et al. 2000). Buprenorphine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and has low oral bioavailability of 15 % (Cone et al. 1984). Bioavailability following sublingual administration of buprenorphine is higher 50-60 % (Nath et al. 1999). After high sublingual doses of buprenorphine (8-24 mg) peak plasma concentrations are reached in 1 hour (McAleer et al. 2003 Ciraulo et al. 2006) and after low sublingual doses (0.4 mg) they are reached in approximately 3 h (Billingham 1981). Approximately two-thirds of a buprenorphine dose is excreted unchanged and the rest is metabolized in the liver and intestinal wall. N-dealkylation of buprenorphine mainly via CYP3A but also CYP2C8 yields norbuprenorphine and glucuronidation yields buprenorphine-3-glucuronide (Cone et al. 984). Norbuprenorphine is excreted in the urine after subsequent conjugation. 80-90 % of buprenorphine is excreted by the biliary system and enterohepatic circulation (Brewster et al. 1984) Although few interaction studies of high-dose buprenorphine and antiretrovirals have been conducted (McCance-Katz EF et al. 2007) the effect of CYP3A inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of low-dose buprenorphine is unknown. Because the use of buprenorphine in pain management is increasing after the introduction of transdermal buprenorphin patches to the market it is clinically relevant to study and quantify possible interactions of buprenorphine with inhibitors of its CYP3A-mediated metabolism such as voriconazole. This study is aimed to examine the possible interactions of oral buprenorphine with voriconazole. Twelve male or female adult non-smoking subjects aged 18-40 years with body weights within ±15% of the ideal weight for height will be recruited for the study. The subjects will be submitted to physical examination determination of previous or present chronic diseases and comprehensive laboratory testing to ascertain that they are in good health. The subjects will fill in a modified Finnish version of the Abuse Questions (Michna et al. 2004) to assess their vulnerability for opioid abuse. Laboratory screening will include CBC (including hemoglobin hematocrit differential WBC platelet count) SGOT SGPT alkaline phosphatase BUN and creatinine and for women a pregnancy test. Urine will be screened for glucose proteins and drugs with addiction potential. Blood pressure in sitting position must be within normal limits. Base line ECG must be normal. Placebo and voriconazole should always be ingested with food except the first dose on day 5. On day 5 the challenge dose of 0.2 or 3.6. mg of oral buprenorphine (Temgesic Schering-Plough) will be administered at 11.00 i.e. 1 h after the last dose of placebo or voriconazole. The dose is 3.6 mg after placebo and 0.2 mg after voriconazole. If necessary naloxone (Naloxone B. Braun Braun) will be given in sufficient doses to counteract the severe adverse effects of buprenorphine. For nausea and vomiting intravenous tropisetron will used if needed. The volunteers will fast at least 8 h before the administration of buprenorphine and they will have a standard meal 4 h and 8 h afterwards. Ingestion of alcohol coffee tea cola energydrinks and grapefruit juice is not allowed during the test days nor is smoking permitted. The interval between the study phases will be four weeks.    ,NCT01466803

Healthy,Immunogenicity and Safety of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (Flumist) Administered by Nasal and Sublingual Route, Background: It is well established that live attenuated organisms can be highly effective vaccines immune responses elicited can often be of greater magnitude and of longer duration than those produced by non-living antigens and are often able to confer protection after a single dose. Unlike killed influenza vaccine preparations injected by the parenteral route live influenza vaccines are able to induce potent secretory (mainly IgA) antibody responses in the airway mucosae and can also evoke cell mediated responses. T cell proliferation cytokine production cytotoxic T cell responses and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity have all been elicited by live attenuated vaccines. There has been a history of the use of live attenuated flu vaccines as safe and effective vaccines for the prevention of flu in animals and humans. Live-attenuated cold-adapted influenza vaccines have been proved to be highly efficacious to protect against clinical fly symptoms. Among these FluMist a nasal vaccine formulation developed by Medimmune Inc has been approved by the US FDA. Recent side by side clinical trials have demonstrated that this nasal vaccine was significantly superior to conventional killed flu vaccine in protecting against flu symptoms. Sublingual administration of live influenza virus at a dose lethal by the nasal route was well tolerated and did not redirect virus to the olfactory bulb. In addition in a recent Phase I clinical study (NCT00820144) conducted in France the sublingual administration of recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (rCTBup to 1 mg) in healthy adult volunteers was found to be safe. A major issue has arisen regarding the ease with which vaccines could be administered to young children especially infants and to elderly subjects in whom nasal vaccination has not been possible and/or approved due to difficulties of administering nasal vaccines in infants and to undesired side effects related to frequent rhinitis and sneezing episodes in elderly subjects. This study is designed to investigate the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a new route of administration of vaccines using the nasal FluMist formulation as prototype vaccine. Objectives: To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a nasal and sublingual influenza virus vaccine (FluMist) in healthy adult volunteers Study design: This will be a randomized study on a total 40 subjects; each 20 subjects will receive vaccine via nasal and sublingual route respectively    ,NCT01488188

Healthy,Influence of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) Challenge on Cognitive and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Markers in Healthy Subjects," Episodic and working memory processes are the most affected cognitive domains in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its early stage Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a unique tool to interfere with cognitive processes by inducing ""virtual and transient lesions"" mimicking those observed in MCI. It has proven repeatedly its capacity to interfere with encoding-retrieval memory task. However to date only few imaging data exist on the cerebral pathways involved in encoding memory task. Moreover the stability of TMS effects over time remains to be investigated. If proven to be a stable interfering challenge TMS could be used to investigate the potential restoring effect of new medication in AD. The study is the pilot study of a larger clinical trial which aims to prove the utility of rTMS as a potential model for prediction of clinical efficacy using a combination of cognitive and neuroimaging endpoints.

Healthy,Abnormal Movements Cerebellum and Sensorimotor : Oculomotor Study, Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary sustained often repetitive muscle contractions of opposite muscles that lead to abnormal twisting movements or odd postures. Essential tremor is a slowly progressive neurologic disorder characterized by the appearance of a tremor during the voluntary movement. The pathophysiology of dystonia or essential tremor is not fully elucidated. Dystonia and essential tremor are associated with dysfunction of the sensorimotor basal ganglia-cortical network and involvement of the cerebellum and cerebellar pathways has also been recently suggested. The investigators propose to study 30 patients having a primary dystonia (15 DYT11 genetically documented) 15 patients having an essential tremor without deep brain stimulation and 15 patients having an essential tremor with deep brain stimulation.A group of 30 healthy volunteers will be recruited and tested according to the same modalities. They will be paired in sex and age. 30 patients having a Parkinson disease will be also tested. Eye position will be sampled with a video-based monocular eye tracker (SMI Germany) before and immediately after an adaptation task. Saccade adaptation is evaluated as the percentage change in the mean saccade amplitude between pre-test and post-test. Expected results:   -  no or fewer alteration of the performance to the adaptation task in the Parkinson group than in the Essential Tremor group/ dystonia group.   -  abnormal reactive saccade backward adaptation in the Dystonia group and Essential Tremor group providing further neurophysiological evidence of cerebellar dysfunction.    ,NCT01495897

Healthy,The Glycaemic and Insulinaemic Responses of Camel Milk, Rationale: Recently human animal and epidemiological studies suggested that camel milk has a hypoglycaemic activity. However a mechanism and reasons for this activity have not been sufficiently studied. Therefore a study on a glycaemic and insulinaemic responses of regular camel milk and camel milk powder is needed. Objective: To explore the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses of regular camel milk and camel milk powder in healthy adults. Study design: In a randomised single-blind and cross over design two hour post prandial glucose and insulin responses of 4 treatments (regular camel milk camel milk powder regular cow milk and glucose) will be measured . Those treatments will be consumed in a portion that contained 25g available carbohydrate. Finger-prick capillary blood samples will be taken at fasting and 15 30 45 60 90 120 minutes after ingestion of the test product. Venepunctures will be taken at fasting 30 and 75 minutes after ingestion of the test product. The measurements will be conducted on 4 separate days with at least 2 days wash out. Study population: 20 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 35 years with BMI between 18.5 to 25 kg/m2. Intervention: The treatments are regular camel milk camel milk powder regular cow milk and glucose. These are standardized to 600ml containing 25g available carbohydrate. Main study parameters/endpoints: Main parameters are postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses. Secondary parameters: amino acid composition and glycemic index.

Healthy,Racemic Ketamine Versus S-ketamine With Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL)-MRI in Healthy Volunteers, Racemic ketamine and S-ketamine are used in clinical practice today. Little is known of their difference in effect on cerebral blood flow volume and metabolism. cerebral blood flow (CBF) measuring techniques are limited in time so constant measurement to mirror a dynamic process is impossible or very difficult. A novel MRI application arterial spin labeling offers the possibility that without radiation or contrast to measure semi-continuous CBF with measurements every 60-120 seconds. The investigators will give 14 healthy volunteers both study drugs in a randomised sequence with one week apart and measure regional CBF during the study period of 45 minutes after a sub-anaesthetic bolus dose of 06 mg/kg racemic ketamine and 03 mg/kg S-ketamine The investigators hypothesize that there is no difference between racemic ketamine and S(+)-ketamine with regards to Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) measured cerebral blood flow.    ,NCT01506921
Healthy,The Effect Of Berry Polyphenols On Human Behaviour, Polyphenols compounds found at high levels in berry fruit have been shown to have health promoting benefits through various mechanisms both in vivo and in vitro. These benefits include antioxidant activity anti-inflammatory properties and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition. This study aims to expand on the extremely promising animal data in the literature and our own pilot study results to investigate whether drinks containing berry fruit can improve cognitive performance and mood in healthy human participants. Our central hypothesis is that fruit extracts can reduce the breakdown of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. This reduction in breakdown could therefore increase the levels of these neurotransmitters and convey some benefits in regards to mood and cognitive function. The investigators will assess the pharmacokinetic activity of berry fruit extracts on MAO activity to test this hypothesis. A second hypothesis is that berryfruit polyphenols may alter circulating levels of glucose that may in turn affect cognitive performance and mood. A prior study carried out by Plant & Food Research through collaboration with the University of Northumbria UK found promising results after acutely supplementing participants with a berry fruit based drink. This study aims to use the results from the previous study to assess in depth the effect of berry fruit drinks on human behaviour.    ,NCT01507012

Healthy,Genetic Response to Warfarin in Healthy Subjects," The purpose of this study is to determine the importance of genetic differences on individuals' response to warfarin in a group of healthy subjects. Warfarin is also known by the ""trade name"" Coumadin and is in a class of medications called anticoagulants or ""blood thinners."" Warfarin works by reducing the blood's ability to make clots. It is used to stop blood clots from forming or growing larger in your blood and blood vessels. Warfarin is prescribed for many conditions including for people with certain types of irregular heartbeat people with replacement or mechanical heart valves people who have suffered a heart attack people who have had orthopedic surgery or who have a history of having blood clots. Warfarin is used to prevent or treat deep vein thrombosis (swelling and blood clot in a vein) pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lung) and strokes (a blood clot in the brain). Researchers have found that certain genes may affect how a person's body will break down or react to warfarin. If genetic information can help doctors better determine the best dose of warfarin before it is first given this may help the doctors get patients to the correct levels of blood thinning and thereby reduce the risk of bleeding or the risk of developing a blood clot. The expectation of this study is that this information will ultimately improve warfarin therapy while lessening the risks associated with dosing errors. This study is considered investigational because the subjects are healthy and not being prescribed warfarin for clinical care.    ",NCT01520402
Healthy,Paracetamol and Pharmacogenetic, Recent works has emphasized that the mechanism of action of paracetamol analgesic depend on its metabolism in the body since a breakdown product of paracetamol the AM404 is now considered the analgesic metabolite of paracetamol suggesting as paracetamol may be a pro-drug. Indeed it has been shown that paracetamol may have a deleterious effect especially in vulnerable populations (hepatic insufficiency elderly). First results showed a very significant decrease in sulfatation and gluthatione and increased phase 1 metabolism of acetaminophen which involves enzymes such as cytochrome P450. Multifactorial causes combining nutrition (depletion of sulfur amino acids) increased detoxification of toxic metabolites of paracetamol stress or trauma are discussed to explain the results. Clinical studies showed a great variability of pain assessment by patients and variability in the metabolic response of paracetamol. Genetic factors probably play a role remains largely unknown. The review of the literature on genetic polymorphism shows the involvement of a number of enzymes that are well known predominantly on the metabolism of acetaminophen liver but without connection with its analgesic effect. This is a critical missing link in the understanding of the analgesic effect of paracetamol.    ,NCT01520792

Healthy,Pharmacokinetic Study of Primaquine and Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine in Healthy Subjects, The observed changes of P. falciparum sensitivity to artemisinin leads to the intensification of early detection as well as treatment monitoring in malaria infection. It is widely accepted that the development of resistance can be delayed by the use of combination therapy especially artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). The resistance problem is considered extremely serious and as the consequence WHO has recommended that all monotherapy for malaria should be stopped Current WHO guideline recommends the drug combination regimens using ACT with effective partner medicines to decrease the risk of development or spreading of artemisinin resistance. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP); the fixed-dose combination of Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and Piperaquine phosphate (PQP) is now one of the recommended drugs by WHO as the oral treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum. DHA-PQP composes of both blood schizonticidal drugs with different mechanism of action and different half-life to improve the therapeutic efficacy and to prevent the development of drug resistance to the individual drug. Moreover it is beneficial for the mutual protection against resistance and long lasting protection against new infection due to long half-life of PQP. Primaquine is an effective gametocytocidal for P. falciparum transmission prevention and as tissue killing for the radical cure in Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale infection. It will be given only in the presence of other antimalarials so it is necessary that the data of the potential drugs interaction of primaquine and DHA-PQP should be characterized. It is inevitable that in the near future Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP) and primaquine combination treatment becomes necessary. These drugs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme which potentially causes pharmacokinetic alteration resulting in clinically significant drug-drug interactions that can cause unanticipated adverse reactions or therapeutic failures because of the suboptimal exposure of the parasite. This study is planned to evaluate potential pharmacokinetic interaction of orally administered primaquine (PQ) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP) in healthy adult subjects. The results of these interaction studies are important in order to provide clinical guidance for the optimum combination of primaquine and DHA-PQP treatment regimens in malaria infections.    ,NCT01525511

Healthy,Does Incorporation of EPA and DHA in Lipoproteins Differ According to Apolipoprotein E Genotype?, Genetics and nutrition both clearly affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the elderly. Apolipoprotein E (APOE4) is the most important known genetic risk for AD and is prevalent in 20-25% of Canadians but at present knowing an individual's ApoE genotype does not help the diagnosis treatment or prevention of AD. Furthermore fish intake containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22:6 omega-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA 20:5 omega-3) may be incorporated as a prevention strategy for lowering the risk of AD. However fish intake seems not to protect APOE4 carriers from developing AD. One explanation as to why APOE4 carriers may not benefit from fish intake is potentially linked with imbalances in omega-3 fatty acid metabolism. The investigators recently reported that after 3g/d of EPA+DHA for 6 weeks increases in the two fatty acids was less for carriers resulting in a significant gene-by-diet interaction. ApoE is a component of lipoproteins and ApoE genotypes modulate the fasting lipoprotein response to fish-oil supplementation. Therefore the investigators hypothesis is that APOE4 genotype is associated with imbalances in lipoprotein concentrations which has the consequence to be associated with imbalances in EPA and DHA transport. The investigators will recruit and test 100 healthy young adults since at older ages carriers of ApoE4 usually take medication altering their lipoprotein profile. They will receive an EPA + DHA supplement for one month. This period was chosen because the 3 class of lipoproteins (VLDL LDL and HDL) have different concentrations in TG phospholipids and cholesteryl esters and to fully investigate lipoprotein fatty acid changes one month of supplementation is needed to change EPA and DHA in all lipid classes. The investigators will monitor the distribution of EPA and DHA in the lipoproteins over a one month supplementation with fish oil and the investigators will separate the investigators groups by APOE4 carriers and non-carriers.    ,NCT01544855

Healthy,Immune Response to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in Health Care Workers, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a human restricted pathogen and is the single most important cause of severe respiratory illness in infants and young children a major cause of infantile bronchiolitis and is the most frequent cause of hospitalization of infants and young children in industrialized countries. Severe RSV infection early in life is associated with an increased risk of subsequent recurrent wheezing and asthma. There are few population-based estimates of the incidence of RSV disease from developing countries but the existing data clearly indicates that the virus accounts for a high proportion of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) in children. Studies in Brazil Colombia and Thailand suggest that RSV causes 20-30% of ARI cases in children from 1-4 years of age a proportion similar to that in industrialized countries and WHO has estimated the global RSV disease burden at 64 million cases and 160 000 deaths every year. RSV also causes severe disease in elderly and immune-compromised adults and the burden of RSV disease in the elderly is comparable to that of seasonal influenza. The economic impact of RSV-related disease in adults estimated to be greater than that of influenza in relation to numbers of days lost from work. The development of a safe and effective vaccine against RSV would benefit greatly from data on the immune responses in healthy adults naturally exposed to the virus. RSV infection has been shown to increase and induce short-lived circulating antibody secreting cells and produce an increase in the RSV specific antibody titres but very limited data is available on the cellular immune responses induced by RSV during natural infection in healthy adults. The existence of cell mediated immune response against RSV in humans has been described but characterization of this response remains poor and simultaneous analysis of several immunological parameters have not been attempted in an RSV exposed population before.    ,NCT01563692

Healthy,Quantitative Heat Loss With Laminar Air Flow, With approval of the IRB at the Cleveland Clinic and written informed consent the investigators propose to study up to 20 healthy volunteers in the protocol below as this will allow for drop-outs. As the investigators believe that 10 volunteers will provide sufficient power to detect clinically-meaningful differences between laminar air flow treatments. The study has been designed to find out whether heat loss increases significantly in laminar air flow operating rooms. Furthermore the investigators will find out whether active warming minimizes this heat loss. Increased heat loss increases the amount of perioperative hypothermia. It has been shown that perioperative hypothermia is associated with severe complications such as an increased incidence of surgical wound infections. On the other hand laminar air flow is explicitly used to decrease air-borne infections. Our study results will help to optimize thermal management of orthopedic patients.    ,NCT01564212

Healthy,Biological Basis of Individual Variation in Social Cooperation, The overall objective of this project is to explore the biological bases of individual variation in cooperative social behavior among normal subjects with the goal of developing hypotheses to explain more extreme variation that manifests as mental illness. Cooperative behavior will be measured in an interactive social task known as the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) Game. There are eight specific aims. Aim 1 is to examine the relationship between individual variation in cooperative behavior and individual variation in brain function during the PD game. This will be accomplished by imaging subjects' brains with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) as they play many rounds of the PD Game with two assumed human partners. Aim 2 is to examine the relationship between individual variation in cooperative behavior and individual variation in prefrontal cortex anatomy. This aim will involve acquiring a structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan from each subject to measure morphometric variation as well as a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) brain scan to measure white matter integrity. Aim 3 is to investigate the impact of intranasal oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) neuropeptides associated with social bonding on cooperative behavior and associated brain activity. In this placebo-controlled double-blind experiment subjects will be randomized to one of three conditions: intranasal oxytocin (OT) administration intranasal vasopressin (AVP) administration or intranasal placebo administration. Functional brain activity and behavior will be compared across treatment groups. Aim 4 is to examine the effect of oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) on cortisol levels. Aim 5 is to examine the relationship between individual variation in cooperative behavior and individual genetic variation. Saliva samples will be collected from each subject for analysis of genes hypothesized to have an influence on cooperative social behavior. Aim 6 is to examine the relationship between individual variation in cooperative behavior and individual variation in personality as assessed by personality tests. Aim 7 is to examine the relationship between individual variation in social intelligence and individual variation in brain anatomy. Aim 8 is to use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to test the effect of vasopressin (AVP) on neural responses to faces which are powerful social signals important for emotional communication. Aim 9 is to use fMRI to investigate the brain regions active during an empathy and perspective-taking task. Aim 10 involves testing the effect of OT on both empathy-related behavior and functional brain activation using a within-subjects placebo-controlled design. Aim 11 investigates the role of early life experience spirituality self-reported prosocial activities and general cognition on empathic and cooperative behavior. Aim 12 is to examine the neural and behavioral effect of Lorazepam used as a challenge agent in the context of iterated PD game in healthy controls. Aim 13 is to examine the effect of OT on behavior and brain activity of unmedicated depressed or anxious men in the context of the iterated PD game. Aim 14 is to determine if DNA methylation of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) modulates the effect of intranasal OT on cooperative behavior and associated brain activity in humans subjects immersed in genuine social interactions.    ,NCT01566539

Healthy,Energy Expenditure Responses to Different Temperatures, Background: - The way that the body burns calories is known as energy expenditure. Some studies show that when we are cold we burn more calories to keep our bodies warm. Brown fat is a special kind of fat that can use energy to keep the body warm. Small animals and infants have been known to have brown fat for many years. Recently it has been suggested that adult humans also have brown fat. If brown fat becomes active (burns calories) in adult humans when exposed to cold then these people would tend to burn off more calories and might not gain weight easily. Learning more about the relationship between energy expenditure brown fat environmental temperature and body temperature may help explain why some people become obese and other people do not. Objectives:   -  To better understand how the body burns calories when exposed to different temperatures.   -  To study brown fat and how it burns calories in cold temperatures. Eligibility:   -  Healthy men between 18 and 35 or 55 and 75 years of age.   -  Healthy women between 18 and 35 years of age.   -  To control for ethnicity participants must be non-Hispanic whites or African Americans. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.   -  Participants will stay in the Metabolic Unit of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center as inpatients for no more than 14 days. The length of the hospital stay will depend on how participants respond to the different study temperatures.   -  Every afternoon participants will walk for 30 minutes on a treadmill. All meals will be provided.   -  Participants will stay up to 5 hours per day in a specialized room with different temperature settings. Temperatures will range from about 61 degrees to 88 degrees Fahrenheit. Body temperature activity calorie burning and cold/hot sensations will be monitored.

Healthy,Do Apolipoprotein E Polymorphisms Influence Risk of Cognitive Decline by Modulating Omega-3 Fatty Acid Metabolism?, BACKGROUND: Compared to the epsilon 2 or epsilon 3 alleles the epsilon 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) is associated with twice the prevalence of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epidemiological studies show that risk of AD varies inversely with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish and seafood. Despite apparently lower fish intake in AD pooled analysis of the literature shows that plasma and brain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is actually the same in AD as in healthy age-matched controls. Fish oil trials in AD are also not convincing. We recently shown that ApoE4 carriers have 41% higher fasting plasma EPA and DHA compared to non-carriers but the plasma EPA and DHA response to fish oil in ApoE4 carriers was half that seen in non-carriers. HYPOTHESES: (i) Carriers of ApoE4 have altered metabolism of carbon-13 (13C)-DHA as well as EPA and DHA provided in a dietary supplement. (ii) A dietary supplement of EPA+DHA will improve cognitive performance but only in non-carriers of ApoE4. OBJECTIVES: In both carriers and non-carriers of ApoE4 to compare whether- i) ApoE4 alters incorporation of 13C-DHA into plasma lipids or its beta-oxidation. ii) 13C-DHA metabolism changes while on a dietary supplement of EPA+DHA; iii) Better cognitive performance occurs while on EPA+DHA and is linked to raising plasma EPA and/or DHA. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS: Participants older than 50 y old and not demented were enrolled. DHA metabolism was evaluated using both 13C-DHA and an EPA+DHA supplement (2.4 g/d for 5 mo; n = 20/gp). Before and in the last month of supplementation plasma uptake and beta-oxidation of 50 mg of 13C-DHA was followed during one month. Blood omega-3 fatty acids was evaluated monthly during the supplementation period. Cognitive testing was performed before and 4 months after starting the omega-3 fatty acid supplement. IMPLICATIONS: This project will help explain the apparent link that is newly emerging between ApoE polymorphisms altered omega-3 fatty acid metabolism and risk of cognitive decline and should help in the development of nutraceutical-based clinical trials using fish oil for the elderly.    ,NCT01577004

Healthy,Determination of Protein Requirement in Elderly Female Subjects 65-75 Yrs Old, Minimal data are available on protein requirements throughout the lifespan. Currently available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the nitrogen balance method have been well described. Importantly nitrogen balanced underestimates requirements. The current DRI requirement for healthy adult males is based on the reanalysis of the nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was reanalyzed statistically by Rand et al. and he concluded that the protein requirement of healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83 (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using IAAO the investigators group estimated the protein requirement of young men (mean age 27 years) to be 0.93 and 1.2 g/kg/day (mean and RDA). Currently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition survey conducted by NHANES the authors concluded that adults between the ages of 51 - 70 years old consumed an average on 1.0 g/kg/day (ideal body weight) of protein which represents about 15 % of calories. Depending on the calculations used for ideal body weight some older adults could be getting higher or lower than requirement. There is no scientifically derived protein estimate for older adults. Therefore there is a need to measurer protein requirement in that population. The goal of this study therefore is to measure the protein requirement of female elderly subjects between the ages of 65 - 70 years using the IAAO technique.    ,NCT01578733

Healthy,A Study of Sustained-Release Liothyronine Sodium (T3) in Healthy Subjects," Liothyronine is indicated for the treatment of primary hypothyroidism. Between 6 and 10 Million in the United States and 80 Million patients world-wide are hypothyroid usually the result of autoimmune thyroiditis called Hashimoto's Disease. Hypothyroid symptoms result from low levels of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) in the blood due to inadequate thyroid hormone production by the thyroid gland. Every tissue in the body is a thyroid hormone target and hypothyroid symptoms can be debilitating. BCT303 utilizes Liothyronine Sodium as the active ingredient the same Liothyronine salt utilized as the active ingredient in currently marketed products. The current ""gold standard"" for treatment of hypothyroidism are products containing Levothyroxine (T4). T4 is known to be a pro-hormone converted to the more active hormone T3 by deiodinases in various tissues. Patients on Levothyroxine therapy alone are occasionally not euthyroid as measured by clinical presentation a condition hypothesized to result from low levels of T3 from inadequate T4 to T3 conversion. In addition the efficiency of conversion of T4 to T3 is variable and dependent on the patho-physiologic state of the patient. BCT303 contains Liothyronine Sodium as the active ingredient. This product has a patented formulation and granulation procedure that solves multiple clinical and stability problems associated with T3-based products. Thus BCT303 is designed to have:   1. Increased shelf stability to ensure the maintenance of claimed dosage.   2. A sustained-release profile to minimize side effects associated with spikes in serum T3 levels.   3. Uniformity of dose between production batches and between tablets.    ",NCT01581463

Healthy,Functional Neuroimaging of Alcoholism Vulnerability (PIT), This project compares Family History Positive (FHP) for alcoholism subjects to matched Family History Negative (FHN) subjects derived from the project Principal Investigator's National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism-funded longitudinal study of drinking behavior in a 2000 college freshman population (known as the Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students study (BARCS)). The age of these subjects is a valuable one at which to capture the transition from harmful use to abuse/dependence. This project explores the effects of memantine in a double-blind randomized counterbalanced manner on alcoholism risk-relevant tasks. More specifically this project studies functional MRI tasks related to different aspects of reward and/or impulsivity-related behavior in different contexts compares the underlying neural circuitry across tasks and uses a pharmacologic probe of the glutamatergic system to examine NMDA/DA interactions. The combined measures provide the opportunity to advance our understanding of specific aspects of brain function related to familial alcoholism vulnerability in an already well-characterized population as some members evolve into alcohol abuse. In addition to conventional within-task analyses functional network connectivity and allied approaches will be used to examine brain networks across tasks. The investigators will study adult male and female subjects in equal numbers who are either offspring of an alcoholic parent or are FHN matched controls. The investigators will recruit and assess a total of 84 (42 FHP and 42 matched FHN) subjects between the ages of 18-21 years on initial BARCS contact. The investigators will use 4 cognitive tasks during the functional MRI (fMRI) which include: 1) a Monetary Incentive Delay Task that distinguishes networks engaged in motivational (anticipation) and consummatory (outcome) components of reward processing; 2) a Go/No-Go Task that measures the ability to inhibit response to a pre-potent stimulus; 3) an Alcohol Cue Reactivity Task that examines Nucleus Accumbens response to alcohol-related versus matched soft drink stimuli; and 4) a Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) Task that dissects a component of the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task and provides an imaging assay of a transfer-like process that can be related to real-world drinking behavior thus informing upon and extending the key findings from CTNA-2.    ,NCT01585168

Healthy,St. Jude Cancer Education for Children Program: The Feasibility of Teacher Delivery (Pilot Study), -The St. Jude Cancer Education for Children Program was created in 2006 as part of the outreach mandate of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The curriculum is designed to teach schoolchildren about cancer and dispel common misconceptions inform students about healthy lifestyle choices that can translate to reduced cancer risk in adulthood and to inspire an interest in science and scientific careers. In the 2010-2011 school year researchers examined the impact of the program in regard to knowledge. It has always been clear that St. Jude personnel are limited to visiting a small number of schools in person each year so in 2011 a teacher's kit to the education program was created. The kit includes all the lesson plans needed to complete the program without the presence of St. Jude staff members. As a result researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital want to test the feasibility of the intervention by schoolteachers and how this mechanism of delivery will affect student knowledge attitudes and health behaviors associated with cancer and healthy living.    ,NCT01591213

Healthy,Multi Dose Effects of a Berry Extract Upon Moodand Cognition in Healthy Young Adults, Berry fruits are widely recognised as natural functional food products. They contain several different phytochemicals which have potential to modulate human health and wellbeing. There is however some debate regarding the mechanisms driving their health promoting properties. Despite the wide health promoting properties of fruit extracts reported in the literature considerable interest over the past decade has primarily been focused on their roles in reducing risk factors associated with cancer and heart disease. Consequently there remains a paucity of actual scientific information on their role in modulating brain functions such as mood learning and memory any decrements of which have very negative impacts on the quality of life. A prior study carried out as the first study of my PhD attempted to bridge this gap in knowledge and found promising results after acutely supplementing participants with a fruit based drink. The findings showed that there was an increased vigilance on attention related psychometric tasks and an increased feeling of calmness. The investigators have hypothesised that these cognitive enhancing effects are due to the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibiting effect of the fruit drink our ex vivo findings support this with a 96% reduction in MAO-B activity. The aims of the current study are threefold: to extend the findings of my previous investigation by extending the tasks explored; to ascertain if the positive results of the first study are dose dependent; and to investigate whether a lower dose can facilitate greater changes in behaviour.    ,NCT01605682

Healthy,FlaxFx A Research Study of the Effects of Flaxseed Lignans on Colon Health," Colorectal (CRC) cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States and its incidence is rising in younger populations. Diet seems to affect risk for CRC. Many parts of our diet are processed and modified by the microbes or bacteria in our gut. There are many different types of bacteria in our gut each one of us has a ""community"" of different types and amounts of each type. When we eat flaxseeds certain types of bacteria will process them - producing compounds that can then affect our body. How much of these compounds are produced by each person depends on the ""community"" of bacteria in the gut. Flaxseed and in certain nuts contain lignans compounds that may have health benefits. Gut bacteria can convert the lignans into biologically active compounds that in animal models prevent the development of colon cancer. The investigators will study how these biologically active compounds affect colon cell-signaling pathways important to colorectal cancer risk. Results from our study will bridge the current knowledge from animal studies and epidemiologic studies and may help to inform approaches for future CRC prevention.    ",NCT01619020

Healthy,Causal Relationships Between LC-omega-3-enriched Diet and Cognition, Nutrition is key to healthy aging for a number of diseases but the investigators have reported imbalances in the distribution of long chain omega-3 fatty acids (LC-omega-3) in the elderly and in the carriers of apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE4) isoform. Carrying APOE4 isoform is currently recognized as being the most important genetic risk factor of cognitive decline. The investigators believe that dysregulation of LC-omega-3 metabolism is intimately link with higher risk of cognitive decline. The current project will investigate whether there is a causal relationship between LC-omega-3-enriched diet and cognition using on the one hand a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design and on the other hand transgenic mice carrying human APOE4. In both study the investigators will focus specifically on the distribution (level) of LC-omega-3 into lipoproteins with age and/or APOE4 isoform to evaluate whether dysfunctional transport of LC-omega-3 is associated with lower cognitive scores on visuospatial capacity verbal fluency or working memory.

Healthy,The Effects of the Direct Acting Antiviral Agent Boceprevir on the Pharmacokinetics of Maraviroc in Healthy Volunteers, Infection by both HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)is frequent due to similar transmission modes. Near 20% of people living with HIV are also infected by HCV. People living with HIV are treated by anti-HIV medications that may interact with numerous other medications including new medications against HCV. Boceprevir is one of these new HCV medications and it is now considered as part of the standard of care for people infected with HCV. Previous research has shown boceprevir may influence the capacity of the liver to breakdown (metabolize) certain medications and when these medications are used in combination with boceprevir their blood concentrations may be increased or decreased which could increase the risk of side effects or decrease efficacy. Among the drugs having a potential for an interaction with boceprevir is maraviroc an anti-HIV medication. If concentrations of maraviroc increase people may experience more side effects. However if concentrations of maraviroc decrease people living with HIV may have a lower suppression of the virus. This could increase the risk for the HIV virus to develop resistance that is that the treatment will no longer be effective. No studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of boceprevir on blood concentrations of maraviroc. This research project addresses this research question. This project however cannot be done with people living with HIV since resistance may develop in these people if the concentrations of maraviroc decrease. It is for this reason that the investigators wish to recruit healthy people not infected with HIV nor HCV. Eleven healthy volunteers will be included. They will receive maraviroc 150 mg (1 tablet) every 12 hours from days 1 to 19 inclusively. On day 5 a total of ten blood samples will be drawn during the following 12 hours (at 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 3 4 5 6 8 and 12 hours after maraviroc morning dose intake) to measure the blood concentrations of maraviroc. Boceprevir 800 mg (4 capsules) every 8 hours with food will be started on day 6 and continued until day 19 inclusively. On day 19 after the morning maraviroc and boceprevir dose another ten blood samples will be drawn over a 12 hour period. A phone follow-up will be done on day 26. Thus the total study duration for subjects is 26 days. The investigators will compare the blood concentrations of maraviroc when given alone to the blood concentrations of maraviroc when given with boceprevir.    ,NCT01627717

Healthy,Effects of Mode of Administration of Soluble Fibre Blend on Glycemia Appetite & Sensory Parameters, Soluble viscous fibre has been established as an effective dietary component for lowering postprandial glycemia and promoting satiety. The effectiveness of viscous fibre has been related to its ability to increase the viscosity of the intra-luminal contents of the small intestine. Hence the proposed mechanism with which soluble fibre affects the glycemic response dependent on the viscosity development in the gut would require that soluble fibre be extractable from the food matrix. This in part may be dependent on the food matrix that the soluble fibre is incorporated in. While properties of soluble fibre and their physiological effects have been studied extensively limited data exists on the most effective mode of administration of fibre to optimize benefits. Furthermore there are no studies to date that have evaluated how different modes of highly viscous soluble fibre would affect the subsequent meal. Hence we propose a research study to determine whether the form of administration taking into consideration the carbohydrate availability of a viscous fibre blend supplement has a significant impact on postprandial and second meal glycemic response and subjective satiety in healthy individuals.    ,NCT01657058

Healthy,The Effect of Capsaicin and Cinnamaldehyde on Intestinal Permeability, An altered permeability has been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Nutrients derived from food are able to influence the permeability of the intestine and can therefore also affect gastrointestinal symptoms. In this study the investigators will investigate the effects of capsaicine and cinnamaldehyde which can be found in hot peppers and cinnamon respectively on gastrointestinal physiology. Objective: To obtain more information about the effects of capsaicin and cinnamaldehyde on the intestine these substances will be infused directly in the duodenum. Hereafter the permeability of the intestine gallbladder motility and the effects on satiety will be assessed. Hypothesis: Duodenal capsaicin and cinnamaldehyde infusion induces changes in the intestinal epithelial barrier function by selectively acting on TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors and releasing serotonin from enterochromaffin cells as determined by the multi sugar permeability test    ,NCT01667523
Healthy,Nutrient Regulation of Amino Acid Transporters in Aging Human Skeletal Muscle, The goal of the research project is to determine how aging and inactivity reduce the muscle anabolic effect of nutrients and lead to muscle and functional loss. The central hypothesis is that aging reduces mTORC1 signaling and the expression of skeletal muscle amino acid transporters in response to anabolic stimulation leading to reduced muscle adaptation to increased intracellular amino acid requirements. The investigators further hypothesize that inactivity exacerbates this effect with significant muscle and functional loss and rehabilitation restores muscle signaling metabolism and function to baseline values.    ,NCT01669590

Healthy,Lidocaine Serum Levels in Healthy Adult Volunteers: a Pilot Evaluation of the J-Tip Delivery System, The J-Tip device (National Medical Products Irvine CA USA) is a single-use needle-free anesthesia delivery system approximately 10cm long and weighing 9g that allow for the rapid delivery of lidocaine hydrochloride prior to peripheral venous access procedures. First introduced in 2001 it uses compressed carbon dioxide for drug delivery into the subcutaneous space. J-Tip is now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for both children and adults. Designed for patients with needle anxiety and phobia several clinical trials (Hollingsworth et al 2000; Cooper JA et al 2000) have shown the device to be effective with no significant untoward effects including in children as young as 3 years old (Zempsky et al 2008). However two recent cases of toxic serum lidocaine levels in pediatric patients at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) following the use of the J-Tip device is concerning. Both patients were administered local anesthetic using the J-Tip device prior to needle-stick and toxicity screens returned with high levels of lidocaine (>6000 mcg/L). Currently there is a limited amount of literature available on the safety profile of the J-Tip Delivery System and no study to date has evaluated serum lidocaine levels following its use likely on the assumption that systemic absorption from the small amount of lidocaine within the device should be negligible. The two pediatric cases highlighted above seem to suggest otherwise. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the safety of the J-Tip device on a small population of healthy adults and to determine if elevated lidocaine levels are present systemically or locally. The primary outcome will be lidocaine serum levels following the administration of the J-Tip device measured at the local site and two distal sites to establish lidocaine serum levels following J-Tip administration. We expect lidocaine levels to be undetectable.    ,NCT01674075

Healthy,Physical Training and the Incretin Effect, It is well known that continuous physical exercise leads to a number of changes in the body. Maximal oxygen uptake; the heart's pumping ability and muscle mass and strength increases. Also the metabolism adapts: The ability to oxidize fat increase and the insulin sensitivity in primarily in muscle but also in the liver increase. Also endocrine glands adapts according to the level of physical activity. It is known that in healthy younger people the insulin secretion from the pancreas after administration of sugar consumed orally or given directly into a vein is significantly lower in trained individuals compared with untrained. This change does however not only apply to glucose as also stimulation by the amino acid arginine shows the same pattern. It seems plausible that the endocrine glands/cells adapts to the level of physical training but this has not yet been investigated. The gastrointestinal tract is the birthplace of a variety of hormones. One group of these is called incretin hormones. They stimulate the glucose dependant insulin secretion in the pancreas and affect hunger/satiety. Whether the incretin production and thus their concentration in the blood is regulated by physical training is unknown. Obese and patients with type 2 diabetes has in contrast to well-trained decreased insulin sensitivity. As a consequence their (type 2 diabetics at least early in their disease course) meal stimulated insulin release is greater than in healthy normal weight individuals. This in spite of the fact that the incretin effect is reduced in obese people and patients with type 2 diabetes compared to healthy normal weight. Whether physical training affects both the secretion of incretins and the incretin effect has not yet been studied. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether incretin hormones in physical well-trained young men have a changed effect on insulin secretion from the pancreas compared to untrained young men. A difference may indicate that the body's endocrine glands adapts to training mode. The investigators hypothesis is that incretin hormones have a decreased effect on the glucose dependant insulin release in physically trained persons and thus results in a lower insulin release at any given plasma glucose level.    ,NCT01698502

Healthy,Evaluation of Immunogenicity Levels in Women With HPV Vaccine in Mexico, In September 2009 the National Vaccination Council approved the policy for anti-HPV vaccination in 9-year-old girls with an extended scheme of 0 6 and 60 months under the following justification:   -  Antibody induction due to the vaccine is greater than that produced by natural exposure to the virus   -  Immune response in girls 9 to 11 years of age is similar to the response obtained after three doses in women 16 to 26 years of age   -  The third dose will be administered at the time when maximum protection is required near the onset of sexual activity Thus the National Institute of Public Health was commissioned to monitor anti-HPV antibody levels in women who received the anti-HPV vaccine to determine non-inferiority of the extended scheme in 9-year-old girls compared with the traditional scheme of 3 doses in women 18 to 24 years of age. To this end a sentinel cohort will be formed to evaluate immunogenicity levels in 3 age groups and stratified by vaccine type. The hypothesis is that in 9-year-old girls who are administered the amplified HPV vaccination scheme (0-6-60) show immunogenicity levels that are not lower than those of adult women who have been administered the traditional scheme (0-1/2-6). The main objectives are to monitor the levels of immunity induced by vaccination against HPV with two vaccination schemes with the quadrivalent vaccine: Traditional Extended (0-6-60 months) and traditional (0-2-6); Monitoring levels of immunity induced by vaccination against HPV with three vaccine schemes with bivalent vaccine: Extended (0-6-60 months) traditional (0-1-6) and two doses (0- 6); as well as evaluating the interchangeability of the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines in the third dose of extended scheme. The study design is to create a sentinel cohort of women vaccinated against HPV in the following comparison groups:   -  Women of nine years with extended vaccination scheme with three doses of quadrivalent vaccine (0-6-60)   -  Women of nine years with extended vaccination scheme with two doses of the quadrivalent vaccine and the third dose with bivalent (0-6-60)   -  Women of nine years with traditional vaccination scheme with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (0-2-6)   -  Women between 18 and 24 years with traditional vaccination scheme with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (0-2-6)   -  Women of nine years with extended vaccination scheme with three doses of bivalent vaccine (0-6-60)   -  Women of nine years with extended vaccination scheme with two doses of bivalent vaccine and the third tetravalent dose   -  Women of nine years with two vaccine doses scheme with the bivalent HPV vaccine (0-6)   -  Women of nine years with traditional vaccination scheme with bivalent HPV vaccine (0-1-6)   -  Women between 18 and 24 years with traditional vaccination scheme with bivalent HPV vaccine (0-1-6)   -  To monitoring HPV infections at month 61 of follow-up a group of 400 women aged 14-15 years who have not been vaccinated against HPV will be invited  in order to make the monitoring of occurrence of HPV infections in urine per month 61 72 96 and 120 post dose 0 in vaccinated groups    ,NCT01717118

Healthy,Assessment of Three Instruments for the Non-invasive Measurement of Arterial Stiffness., The ASI Non-Invasive Arterial Stiffness Screening Device (ASI Device) is an investigational device under development for the non-invasive assessment of arterial stiffness. The ASI Device is considerably smaller and more cost effective than its commercially available counterparts. As the device is readily portable it is intended to be targeted for use in the community (or at home) as opposed to within the hospital or clinic setting only. However as the device is still under development it is not known whether it is capable of determining arterial stiffness with the same sensitivity and consistency as those already in commercial use. An added variable is the fact the sensor for the ASI Device is located on the fingertip. Validation is a prerequisite for obtaining Health Canada approval of devices for diagnostic purposes. The ASI Device has not been tested against other instruments capable of providing similar measurements. Therefore a clinical trial to compare the ASI Device against similar devices is necessary. The study will compare measurements of arterial stiffness and other central haemodynamic parameters obtained with the ASI Device against similar measurements from devices that have already been approved for this purpose by Health Canada/United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).    ,NCT01722474

Healthy,Chronic Cold Exposure and Energy Metabolism in Humans, Background: - Researchers are studying how metabolism and hormone levels change in response to mild changes in environmental temperature. Changes in metabolism may lessen with time because of hormonal adaptations. If this increase in metabolism continues for a longer period mild cold exposure may cause weight loss. It is unclear whether exposure to a warmer temperature may cause opposite changes in metabolism. Researchers want to see if longer exposure (1 month) to different temperatures can affect how the body uses energy. Objectives: - To test changes in energy metabolism in response to different room temperatures. Eligibility: - Healthy men between 18 and 40 years of age. Design:   -  The entire study will last for 4 months. It will involve a screening visit and a 4-month inpatient stay at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. The inpatient stay will be in a private room at the Metabolic Clinical Research unit. Study participants will be required to stay in the Metabolic Clinical Research unit during the night but are free to leave during the day.   -  At the screening visit participants will have a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples will be collected. A heart function test and diet questionnaire will also be given.   -  During the first month the temperature of the private room will be set at to 75.2 degrees F. This will allow the body to become used to the testing environment.   -  During the second month the temperature will be set to either a cool (66.2 degrees F) or a warm (80.6 degrees F) temperature.   -  During the third month the temperature will return to 75.2 degrees F.   -  During the fourth month the temperature will be altered to the opposite temperature to the one set in the second month.   -  Throughout stay participants will have daily temperature monitoring and will keep a food diary. Once a week they will collect all of their urine for 24 hours. Once a month they will spend 24 hours in a metabolic suite to study their metabolism rate.   -  Throughout stay the food will be provided as part of the study.   -  During the first and third month (75.2 degrees F) the participants will be allowed to leave the Metabolic Clinical Research unit during the weekends while during the second and forth month (66.2 or 80.6 degrees F) the participants will be allowed to spend one weekend out of the Metabolic Clinical Research unit.   -  Other tests such as body scans fat tissue samples and imaging studies will be performed as needed.    ,NCT01730105

Healthy,Donepezil Effect on Visual Attention and Training, The present proposal investigates the role of the cholinergic system (the neurotransmitter acetylcholine) in improving vision and visual attention. Vision results from a complex processing of particular stimuli of the visual field. Attention enhances and prolongs the neural representations of visual input in the visual cortex. It has recently been shown that attention in the visual cortex depends on cholinergic mechanisms. The action of acetylcholine in the visual cortex consists in enhancement of the responsiveness to thalamocortical inputs depression of local neuronal connections or extrastriate feedback projections and induction of gamma synchronisation. The investigators hypothesize that these effects are associated with long-term changes in functional connectivity in the visual cortex visual attention and visual learning (improvement of the visual capacities). In the present proposal the investigators will test whether the administration of donepezil (Aricept 5mg) a drug that increases the level of acetylcholine in the brain will enhances the perceptual-cognitive abilities of young adult subjects. Perceptual-cognitive performance will be assessed in a multiple object tracking (MOT) task in a 3D automatic virtual environment. MOT is a task where observers are asked to maintain attentional focus on a limited number of preselected subgroup of elements in a dynamic scene. Multifocal attentional mechanisms are necessary to process the information. The task will be tested five time at one week interval to test whether donepezil and training improved the task performance of the subject i.e. lead to perceptual learning. This study could help establish an intervention procedure to improve visual performance of subjects that need it.    ,NCT01738295

Healthy,Imaging the Effect of Experimental Stress on Small and Large Bowel Water During Fructose Absorption, The investigators have been developing new non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to image the small bowel. Building on those studies the investigators want to study in healthy volunteers the effects of stress on the water content of the small bowel following ingestion of fructose. This is important because in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) there seems to be a strong association of stress and anxiety with the severity of the disease. Many IBS patients complain of food intolerances and recent studies have suggested that food with high content of fructose can worsen symptoms of IBS. The investigators will carry out a study in which the investigators will induce a moderate state of stress in healthy volunteers using an injection of corticotrophin release hormone feed them a drink containing fructose and image their bowel at intervals using MRI. Improving our understanding of the effects of stress and fructose on small bowel physiology will help us to understand better some aspects of the symptoms such as bloating altered bowel habit and abdominal discomfort experienced by the IBS patients and to guide therapy. The investigators hypothesize that the effect of CRH will cause significant decrease in small bowel water content (SBWC) and a faster small bowel transit with increased malabsorption following consumption of fructose.    ,NCT01763281

Healthy,Training Study to Characterize Biomarkers to Chickenpox and Yellow Fever Vaccines," It is thought that vaccines trigger innate inflammatory responses to induce antigenspecific adaptive immunity (the desired effect) but excessive inflammation may lead to serious inflammatory complications or unwanted side effects. Currently there is a lack of reliable biomarkers (a measurable biological response that predicts something) able to predict severe inflammation and this has resulted in the development of several vaccines being terminated and the withdrawal of some licensed vaccines which were associated with inflammatory complications. This study is part of the BIOVACSAFE project which is a 5year ??0M project funded by the Innovative Medicine Initiative. The project involves a series of clinical studies using licensed vaccines as benchmarks to generate clinical data on inflammation and identify biomarkers that can be used to predict acceptable reactogenicity. The target is to identify biomarkers that can predict the occurrence of beneficial and detrimental effects in response to a vaccine. Such biomarkers could be used in future vaccine development programs to optimize selection of vaccine candidates with a profile that will be unlikely to generate worrisome safety signals once they are in generalized use. This study is one in a series of ""training"" studies which will each use different licensed vaccines that are prototypical representatives of a class of vaccine used in a particular target population. Forty eight subjects will be randomised into three groups to receive: A) Varicella zoster vaccine (n = 20) B) Yellow Fever vaccine (n = 20) C) Saline placebo (n = 8). Following a screening visit participants will undergo a seven day residential visit which will include immunization and intensive monitoring of physiological (e.g. heart rate oral temperature blood pressure) metabolic and immune (innate and adaptive) parameters.

Healthy,Evaluation of [11C]Cimbi-36 as an Agonist PET Radioligand for Imaging of 5-HT2A Receptors, The serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is the most abundant excitatory serotonin (5-HT 5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor in the human brain and multiple positron emission tomography (PET) studies have investigated the 5-HT2A receptors in the human brain using antagonist radioligands. However the currently available antagonist PET radioligands bind the total pool of 5-HT2A receptor receptors whereas a 5-HT2A receptor agonist binds the high-affinity subgroup of the receptors which are also G-protein coupled and thus hypothesized to be the functional relevant population of receptors. At the Center for Integrated Molecular Brain Imaging (CIMBI) a novel agonist PET radioligands for brain imaging of 5-HT2A receptors was recently validated in animals (Ettrup et al. 2011 EJNMMI). In the human brain [11C]Cimbi-36 was validated as a selective 5-HT2A receptor agonist PET radioligand through a blocking study with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist pharmaceutical ketanserin. In this validation study the biodistribution and kinetic modelling of [11C]Cimbi-36 binding in the human brain was also validated. With these studies investigators will test the most promising of these [11C]Cimbi-36 in clinical trials where it will provide a novel method for detecting dysfunction in the 5-HT system. The specific aim of this clinical trial is: - To examine the effect of acute alterations in 5-HT levels on cerebral [11C]Cimbi-36 binding in healthy volunteers who will be PET-scanned at baseline and after pharmacological or dietary interventions that either increase or decrease cerebral 5-HT levels. It is hypothesized that this novel agonist radioligand will provide both a more physiological relevant measure of the 5-HT2A receptors and also reflect levels of cerebral 5-HT in humans more specifically: BP will decrease after pindolol and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment and increase after acute tryptophan depletion (ATD). Placebo will leave binding potential (BP) unchanged.    ,NCT01778686

Healthy,The Safety of Tuberculosis Treatments by Oral Inhalation, The inhaled route of delivery has always been associated with the considerable challenge of getting the drug to its target. The lungs are a highly complex organ designed to filter inspired air with many different cell types contributing to their function. Furthermore the lungs may change dramatically when afflicted by disease resulting in an internal environment that works against the drug reaching and interacting successfully with the target. For targets in the upper airways this will have lesser significance but drug delivery to the deep lung may be impeded by changes such as mucus hyper-secretion or thickening or airway narrowing. In order to interpret toxicology findings it is necessary to reconcile test sensitivity background biological variation normal responses to inhaled materials and drug or medicine-specific adverse effects. Identification of adverse end-points is an area where better control data sets might help discern true adverse effects from a normal physiological lung response. The lung responds acutely to inhalation of irritant materials by hyper-secretion of mucus chemokine release inflammatory cell recruitment and cough and collectively these may be characterized as non-specific irritancy.    ,NCT01785927

Healthy,Influence of Age on the Absorption and Metabolism of Cocoa Flavanols, Accumulating evidence suggests that regular consumption of foods and beverages rich in flavanols such as cocoa tea apples and wine may have cardiovascular benefits. Several well-controlled randomised human intervention studies have shown that cocoa flavanols have beneficial effects on blood pressure endothelial function and other biomarkers of cardiovascular health. These vascular improvements have been correlated in time with changes in plasma flavanol metabolites. The health benefits of flavanol consumption are therefore likely dependent on changes in their absorption distribution metabolism and excretion (ADME). Recent studies have provided detailed information regarding the absorption and metabolism of cocoa flavanols. However there is a lack of information on whether there are changes in flavanol absorption and metabolism with increasing age.    ,NCT01790009

Healthy,Effect of B-GOS on GI Discomfort in Healthy Adults, The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of a new food supplement which is currently available in the market called Bimuno® (B-GOS) on gastrointestinal discomfort (e.g. bloating abdominal pain/cramp and flatulence) in adults who often experience these symptoms but are otherwise healthy. About 400 volunteers will take part in this study which will last 6 weeks (to include 4 weeks treatment and 2 weeks follow up period). Episodes of abdominal pain or discomfort (e.g. bloating abdominal pain/cramp and flatulence) in the absence of diseases are commonly associated with food or drug intake or with alterations of bowel habit and vary between individuals in frequency and severity. Some dietary ingredients are known to reduce these symptoms. We have used B-GOS previously in trials with healthy younger and older adults and we have observed a trend towards reducing abdominal bloating. However the investigators have not tested B-GOS in healthy adults who often experience these symptoms and this is what we will investigate now.    ,NCT01824667

Healthy,Simultaneous FMRI and NIRS to Estimate Brain Cerebral Metabolism, The principal advantages of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with blood-oxygenation- level-dependent (BOLD) contrast for studying brain function are: non-invasiveness ubiquitous availability relatively high spatiotemporal resolution and the ability to map function over the entire brain. Thus BOLD fMRI is the most widely applied technology to study healthy brain function and pathophysiology associated with disease. In studies of drug abuse and psychiatric illness though normal assumptions mapping BOLD signals to neurometabolism may be violated. Generally these effects are ignored resulting in large study-to-study variability. Quantitative fMRI (qfMRI) measures metabolism directly and is more suitable for studies of drug abuse and psychiatric illness. However qfMRI is too complex for routine use. Cerebral metabolism during brain activation during visual stimulation measured with a new fMRI approach that is simple enough for clinical applications will be compared to CMRO2 activation measured using standard qfMRI.    ,NCT01825096

Healthy,The Influence of Energy Drinks on the Blood Oxygenation Concentration of the Optic Nerve, The present proposal investigates the influence of energy drinks on the blood oxygenation concentration of the optic nerve on healthy subjects. On a voluntary basis 15 subjects man or woman will be selected to undergo this experiment. Many factors can influence the blood oxygenation concentration of the optic nerve which will be measured also during this experiment namely: Intra ocular pressure (IOP) blood pressure heart rate and systemic hemoglobin saturation. The subjects will have to be tested twice to test the two conditions of this experiment:   1. The effect after the intake of a can of Redbull (250 ml)   2. The difference with the intake of 250 ml of water The purpose of this study is to determine if the blood oxygenation concentration of the optic nerve varies after having ingested 250 ml of Redbull. Our hypothesis are:   1. The blood oxygenation concentration of the optic nerve measured with OSOME (see detailed description below) decreases due to the consumption of the energy drink Redbull compared to an equal volume of water.   2. The IOP measured with iCare tonometer decreases after the consumption of the energy drink Redbull compared to an equal volume of water.   3. The systemic blood pressure measured with an automatic sphygmomanometer remains constant after ingestion of Redbull energy drink or an equal volume of water.   4. Heart rate measured with a sphygmomanometer automatic increases after taking a Redbull energy drink compared to an equal volume of water.   5. The rate of systemic hemoglobin saturation measured with a pulse oximeter remains constant after the ingestion of a Redbull energy drink or an equal volume of water.    ,NCT01827150

Healthy,The Antiplatelet and Immune Response Trial, Platelets are the main type of blood cell involved in the formation of blood clots that cause heart attacks. The investigators give antiplatelet drugs (aspirin for example) to reduce the risk of another clot forming in the future and causing another heart attack. Platelets are known to have a role in inflammation and infection as well as clotting. In a recent large clinical trial known as the PLATO study it was also shown that patients treated with a new antiplatelet medication (ticagrelor) developed fewer lung infections as well as fewer heart attacks compared to the current standard treatment (clopidogrel). The investigators would therefore like to investigate the reasons behind this and look at the effect of these medications on immune response. This may help us develop new drugs that have a better effect on immune response. The investigators are planning a clinical trial that investigates the effect of these medications on the immune response of healthy volunteers aged 18 to 65. Only volunteers with no significant past medical history and not taking any medications will be included. Thirty volunteers will receive either a normal dose of ticagrelor or clopidogrel or no antiplatelet medication for 1 week. They will then attend the Sheffield Clinical Research Facility where their immune response will be stimulated using a safe well established method. The investigators will do this with an injection of a low dose of endotoxin which is part of the surface coating of some bacteria and has been used extensively in similar studies in over a thousand volunteers over the past 20 years to investigate immune response. It is known to cause temporary flu-like symptoms that last approximately 68 hours. The investigators will take measurements of inflammatory markers white blood cell function and platelet function and compare the effect of ticagrelor and clopidogrel on this immune response.    ,NCT01846559

Healthy,Microdose and First-In-Human (FIH) Study of Recombinant Human Placental Alkaline Phosphatase (hRESCAP), In the present study human recombinant placental alkaline phosphatase (hRESCAP) will be investigated. Alkaline Phosphatase is naturally present in the body and reported to use lipopolysaccharde (LPS bacterial endotoxins) and extracellular nucleotides leaking from damaged and ischemic cells as physiological substrates. The LPS-substrate prevalence makes alkaline phosphatase an interesting novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of LPS-mediated diseases. A bovine homologue of this protein (bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase BIAP) has previously been investigated for treatment of acute inflammatory responses such as sepsis and was shown to be safe in humans. hRESCAP which will be investigated in the current study is expected to have a longer half-life in humans than the previously investigated BIAP due to the fact that it is more sialylated. The possibility to increase the t1/2 to days instead of minutes enables treatment of chronic diseases.    ,NCT01889147

Healthy,Health Impacts of Sustainable Ingredient Selection in the Food and Drink Industry - ALTERNATIVE PROTEIN STUDY, Summary This research will examine the nutritional effects of supplementing diets with alternative plant sources of protein with potential to be grown in Scotland. In particular we will assess the potential of these plant protein sources to complement diets in which the predominant source of protein is meat. These protein sources will include plants from the Fabaceae Cannabaceae and Polygonaceae families which could be used as the basis for the development of new foods. The research will assess if these plant proteins can deliver a comparable alternative to meat based diets. It is anticipated that the results could encourage increased consumption of plant products which would be favorable for consumers shifting away from animal-derived proteins for health and/or environmental reasons. Hypothesis: Consumption of protein rich plants could be a sustainable and healthy choice for partial replacement in predominantly meat based diets. Objective: The objective of this acute study is to assess satiety postprandial effects metabolite bioavailability and metabolism of single alternative proteins from a shortlist including buckwheat fava beans lupin pea and hemp in comparison with red meat. Study protocol Aims: To assess the impact of a pea fava bean lupin hemp buckwheat in comparison with meat in healthy people on:   -  Biomarkers of satiety as measured by gut-related hormones and subjective appetite using visual analogue scales specifically to be collected during the meal over a three hour period every 30 minutes.

Healthy,The Conversion of ENcapsulated GlucorAphanin Gut Microbiota Phylogeny and gEnotype Study (ENGAGE), The variation in extent of isothiocyanate (ITC) excretion in urine from a capsule delivered dose of glucoraphanin will correlate with differences in (a) the gut microbiota and (b) the genotype of key polymorphic genes (GSTM1 GSTT1 and other as yet undetermined candidate genes). Our study is a human dietary intervention in which participants will consume one capsule containing 100mg purified glucoraphanin from broccoli. The levels of glucoraphanin delivered by the capsule are similar to one to two portions of broccoli. As this is purified glucoraphanin there is no myrosinase enzyme present. All conversion of the glucoraphanin contained within the capsule to ITC will therefore occur by enzymes found in the gut microbiota. The ability of the glucoraphanin in the capsule to be metabolised to ITCs by the gut microflora is unknown and will be assessed by measuring ITCs excreted in the urine. The ITCs will be quantified in urine using validated analytical methods. It has been shown in human dietary intervention studies that the extent of conversion of glucosinolates varies greatly. In order to assess possible causative factors for variation in rate of glucoraphanin metabolism each participant will provide a faecal sample from which their faecal gut microbiota phylogeny will be analysed. For a small number of participants a second faecal sample will be requested (a maximum of 3 participants). It is our aim to select one low one medium and one high ITC excreter. Ideally the low and high excreters would be within the lowest and highest 5% excretion of ITC and the third participant would be as close to the mean ITC excretion as possible. The aim would be to culture the faecal microbiota over time with repeat dosing of glucoraphanin in order to select for microbiota that are able to metabolise glucoraphanin. It is known that the main hydrolysis product of glucoraphanin sulforaphane has a variety of benefits to human health however there is no known clinical relevance to being a high medium or low excreter of ITC. For each participant a blood sample will also be requested in order that we can assess whether genotype affects the rate of ITC excretion in urine. The GSTM1 genotype and other as yet unidentified candidate genes of each participant will be determined. Whether the genotype affects the rate of ITC excretion either alone or in combination with the phylogenetic profile will be assessed.    ,NCT01927666

Healthy,Intrathecal Hydromorphone for Post-cesarean Delivery Pain - a Dose Finding Study, Pain relief after cesarean delivery can be provided in a few ways. Most commonly certain medications called opioids such as morphine are given through the vein or into the muscle. However a more effective way to give pain relief with fewer side effects (such as nausea and slowing your breathing) is to give opioids in the spinal space as part of the medications given for a cesarean delivery. For many years the opioid of choice was morphine due to its long anesthetic effect and acceptable side effect profile. A nation-wide disruption in the supply of preservative-free morphine has made it necessary to look for alternatives. Many institutions worldwide have used another opioid called hydromorphone in the spinal space for over a decade. This drug has a very good safety and side effect profile and has been used at our institution for more than a year. Of interest while a number of different doses of hydromorphone have been used there have been very few studies to evaluate the best dose for providing good pain relief with minimal side effects. The goal of this study is to find the best dose of spinal hydromorphone for women undergoing cesarean delivery.    ,NCT01943565

Healthy,An Investigator Initiated Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Brain Network Activation (BNA?? Technology in the Management of Sport Related Concussion, Currently there is no direct reliable bed-side and non-invasive method for assessing changes in brain activity associated with concussion. Event Related Potentials (ERPs) which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli may offer such a method as they provide both a noninvasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs provide excellent temporal information but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited. However by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial resolution for ERPs is improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will combine neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition methods (BNA?? to temporally and spatially map brain function connectivity and synchronization. The proposed study will provide additional evidence for the utility and contribution of the BNA??test (reflecting temporal and spatial changes in brain activity as well as brain functional connectivity associated with concussion) in concussion management. The BNA test is basically divided to 3 phases - first EEG data is collected from subjects using an EEG system while the subject is performing a cognitive task in front of a computer. The EEG data is then analyzed using the advanced BNA??technology. Finally a report of the BNA??test is generated.    ,NCT01963247

Healthy,Effects of Tolvaptan in Healthy Adults, Tolvaptan is one of new class of medications approved for treatment of low blood sodium (hyponatremia). It works by interfering with the effect of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin thereby increasing urine output and decreasing body water. However the magnitude of these effects vary from person to person. Thus the efficacy of tolvaptan is less reliable than an infusion of a concentrated salt solution for emergency short term treatment of hyponatremia. This study is designed to test 3 hypotheses about the variable efficacy of tolvaptan.   1. The variable effect on urine output is due to individual differences in blood vasopressin which counteracts the effects of tolvaptan.   2. The differences in blood vasopressin are due to individual differences in the amount secreted in response to a rise in blood sodium.   3. The variable effect on blood sodium is due mainly to the variable effect on urine output and can be corrected by maintaining water intake below urine output. The study has 2 parts and will be performed in 12 healthy adult males.   1. Six subjects will receive tolvaptan at a dose of 60 mg by mouth and six subjects will receive tolvaptan at 30 mg by mouth. Blood and urine will be collected hourly for 6 hours and water will be ingested in prescribed amounts. For the next 16 hours subjects will drink at will and blood and urine will be collected 4 more times.   2. One week later the same subjects will receive a concentrated salt solution (3% saline) by vein for 6 hours. During this time blood and urine will be collected hourly but drinking will not be permitted. For the next 4 hours subjects will be allowed to drink at will while blood and urine are collected twice more. The volume concentration and creatinine content of each urine will be determined. Blood will be analyzed for sodium vasopressin and in the first study tolvaptan.    ,NCT01973140

Healthy,Effect of the Consumption of Ferric Hydroxide Adipate on Urinary Phosphorus Excretion., Ferric hydroxide adipate is a ferric iron supplement containing iron hydroxide and a dietary organic acid that was developed at MRC Human Nutrition Research. We aim to determine if the ingestion of ferric hydroxide adipate with food induces a reduction in urinary phosphate concentration compared with the administration of placebo plus the same food on a different occasion. We hypothesise that ferric hydroxide adipate binds some phosphate ions in the gastrointestinal tract which prevents part of the phosphate load in a meal from being absorbed. On another visit calcium will be given with the same food as a positive control since this element is well known to restrict dietary phosphate absorption through the formation of insoluble calcium phosphates in the gut lumen. We will compare urinary phosphate concentrations after co-ingestion of the calcium salt and food versus urinary phosphate following ferric hydroxide adipate and the same food. Additionally the calcium data will be compared with placebo data since a significant reduction in urinary phosphate concentrations after calcium treatment will confirm the suitability of the study design. Finally iron absorption from the ferric hydroxide adipate treatment will be determined by labelling this preparation with 58Fe and measuring day 14 erythrocyte 57Fe:58Fe. The study design is: Three-way cross-over volunteer absorption study. Volunteers will not be told which treatment they receive (placebo ferric hydroxide adipate or supplemental calcium). Researchers co-ordinating the study on a day to day basis will be aware of treatment allocation but analysts will not be told which samples correspond to which treatments.    ,NCT01991574

Healthy,The Effect of Heat on Blood and Oxygen Flow Readings Part 2, This is the second part of a research study in order to determine if using a specialized pulse oximetry probe with external heat pack will help obtain oxygen saturation (SaO2) and heart rate (HR) during monitoring for patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) vasoconstriction and hypothermic extremities. The inability to obtain accurate SaO2 and pulse readings can lead to misdiagnosis incorrect treatment or procedures to be canceled. SaO2 and pulse readings are important to maintain patient stability during diagnostic testing surgical procedures and monitoring while in critical care areas. Changes in SaO2 and pulse are important to monitor in order to be able to compensate for any decrease in patient oxygen saturations during hemodynamic monitoring. The primary aim of this study is to determine if using a specialized pulse oximetry probe with external heat pack will improve oxygenation readings in order to obtain SaO2 and pulse readings in patients with PVD vasoconstriction and hypothermic extremities as compared to readings obtained from an arterial blood gas. The hypothesis is using a specialized pulse oximetry probe with external heat pack will help obtain more accurate pulse oximetry readings consistent with values obtained with an arterial blood gas.    ,NCT01992939
Healthy,Control of Cognition," The goal of this research is to understand the functioning of 'regulatory circuits' in the brain. These are brain circuits which allow a person to regulate their attention regulate their behavioral responses and regulate their decision-making. We are also interested in how the stimulant medications methylphenidate and naltrexone affect these regulatory circuits. Methylphenidate is a widely-used FDA approved medication used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and is also known as Ritalin. Naltrexone is an FDA approved medication used to help treat alcohol and substance abuse. This research study will use a scanning technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)which takes a special kind of picture of the brain that enables us to ""see the brain at work"". Adult participants will be given a one-time dose of either methylphenidate naltrexoneor placebo before each fMRI scan session. There are three total fMRI scan sessions. Therefore each participant will receive each possible medication/placebo only once. Thus using the fMRI technique our main purpose for this research is to better understand the functioning of regulatory circuits in conditions such as ADHD and alcohol dependence. This research may one day help us develop better treatments for these disorders.    ",NCT01993108

Our goal is to learn more about the brain mechanisms by which methylphenidate improves effortful control.    ,NCT01993147
Healthy,Effects of Kinesiotape on Quadriceps and Hamstring Muscle Strength, Background: Kinesiotaping (KT) is an elastic therapeutic tape developed in the 70's by Dr Kenso Kase for prevention and treatment of sports injuries. Research shows that through activation of skin receptors KT improves blood and lymph flow increases proprioception helps relieve pain facilitates joint and muscle alignment and enhances muscle function. Despite the increasing popularity of KT uncertainty remains regarding in particular its effectiveness in improving strength. Purpose: The purpose of the current study was to investigate the short-term effects of KT on muscle strength when applied to the quadriceps muscles of healthy subjects. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with 52 healthy subjects was conducted. Subjects were tested under four different conditions: a) facilitating Kinesiotape b) inhibiting Kinesiotape c) classical tape with no elastic properties and d) no-taping across four different sessions. The parameters of interest were: quadriceps and hamstrings maximal strength and power using vertical jump tests (squat jump and countermovement jump) and peak concentric and eccentric knee torque (using isokinetic test protocol).    ,NCT01994421

Healthy,Effect of Metamizole (Dipyrone) on Renal Function in Salt-depleted Healthy Subjects, The planned study is a single-center randomized open-label parallel group study in 16 healthy male subjects. Study subjects will be randomly allocated either to the metamizole group (1) or to the naproxen group (2). All participants will start with a low sodium diet (approximately 50 mmol Na+ per day) 7 days before the first drug intake and maintain the diet until the end of the study (14 days in total). Salt-depletion is an accepted model to enhance production of vasodilatory prostaglandins and to increase renal sensitivity to prostaglandin inhibition. On the first day of treatment (Day 1) a single dose of metamizole or naproxen will be administered to investigate the effects after a single dose and to collect single dose pharmacokinetic profiles. Starting on Day 2 all participants will receive therapeutic doses i.e. 1000 mg metamizole 'ter in die' (TID three times a day) or 500 mg naproxen 'bis in die' (BID twice a day) for one week and on Day 7 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics effects will be assessed under near steady-state conditions. The primary objective is the characterization of the renal effects of metamizole by determination of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the inulin clearance. Secondary objectives are the characterization of the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) metabolite 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 (PGF1)alpha as well as the urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. Overall clinical experience suggests better renal tolerability of metamizole possibly due to less potent COX-inhibition compared to classical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). If this could be confirmed metamizole would be a valuable alternative for treatment of painful conditions in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore the aim of this study is to examine the effects of metamizole on renal function in comparison with the non-specific COX-inhibitor naproxen.    ,NCT01995006

Healthy,Comparison of Both Metabolic and Functional Effects Induced by Two Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Protocols: A Comprehensive Approach Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy," Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has emerged as a suitable tool for restoring maintaining and/or enhancing muscular performance. From a practical point of view NMES can elicit contractions either by direct activation of motor axons (i.e. peripheral mechanism) or by the recruitment of motoneurons in the spinal cord through the depolarization of sensory axons (central mechanism). It is noteworthy that NMES parameters widely affect the balance between transmission along these two pathways. Conventional NMES is usually delivered using short pulse duration (0.05-0.4 ms) low stimulation frequency (15-40 Hz) and high stimulus intensities so that the large antidromic volley in motor axons ensures that the evoked contraction will be driven largely by the direct depolarization of motor axons beneath the stimulation site with no or little involvement of central nervous system. On the contrary when NMES is delivered using wide pulse widths (1 ms) and high frequency (up to 100 Hz) (WP-HF NMES) a portion of the evoked contraction arises from a central mechanism and the corresponding force (recently referred to as ""extra force"") is significantly (three times) larger than the conventional NMES-induced force. This extra force is supposed to represent the central contribution from the recruitment of spinal motoneurons by the evoked afferent volley given that no additional force was observed during a complete anesthetic block of the nerve proximal to the stimulation site. Despite the obvious differences in terms of activation of the neuromuscular system between conventional and WP-HF NMES the functional metabolic and cortical responses associated to both protocols remain to be determined    ",NCT02001675

Healthy,Gastrointestinal Behavior of Posaconazol in Healthy Volunteers, The aim of this study is to understand the behavior of posaconazol gives as a suspension and solution in the gastrointestinal tract in human volunteers. The investigators know that supersaturation for this compound can be achieved by the influence of the gastrointestinal tract: The acid environment of the stomach creates a optimized environment for the basic compound to reach a high solubility while the neutral environment of the small intestine creates a low solubility environment for the compound. The transit from stomach to small intestine gives the opportunity for the drug to create a supersaturated solution. Giving the drug as a solution to the healthy volunteer makes sure that precipitation is not occurring in the stomach and that precipitation has to happen in the small intestine. After all supersaturation is a state that is not thermodynamic stable and always will want to precipitate. Giving the drug as a suspension to the healthy volunteers can make it possible that still some particles of the drug are not in dissolution and that those particles will flow to the small intestine where other particles easily can bind to. This will make that almost the whole supersaturated solution is immediately precipitated. The investigators want to give the suspension by the authorized drug called Noxafil. On the other hand an aqueous solution will be made by adjusting the pH to 1.2 (which is conform with the pH of the stomach) and given to the volunteers by the stomach catheter. This 2 formulations will be tested in a fasted state and a fed state (by giving 2 Ensure plus shakes to the volunteers before the experiment starts). After intake of the formulation gastric and duodenal fluids will be aspirated by the catheters and analyzed at their laboratory. So the four conditions the investigators want to study are:   1. 10 mL Suspension of posaconazol (Noxafil 40mg/mL) together with a glass of 240 mL water in a fasted state   2. 250 mL solution of posaconazol by dissolving 2.6 mL autohorized suspension (Noxafil) in 247 mL water adjusted to pH 1.2 by hydrochloric acid given to the volunteer in a fasted state.   3. 10 mL Suspension of posaconazol (Noxafil 40mg/mL) together with a glass of 240 mL water in a fed state (by giving 20 minute before intake of the formulation 2 ensure plus shakes)   4. 250 mL solution of posaconazol by dissolving 2.6 mL autohorized suspension (Noxafil) in 247 mL water adjusted to pH 1.2 by hydrochloric acid given to the volunteer in a fed state (by giving 20 minute before intake of the formulation 2 ensure plus shakes).

Healthy,Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability of Pomegranate Phenolics and Urolithins in Healthy Subjects., Pomegranate phenolics (such as the ellagitannin punicalagin and ellagic acid) are metabolized by the human gut microbiota to yield a number of metabolites called urolithins (mainly Uro-A). Both ellagic acid (EA) and urolithins can exert a number of biological activities. However the bioavailability of ellagic acid has been reported to be very low and the existing studies are controversial so far. The investigators want to carry out a robust (cross-over double-blind) pharmacokinetic assay in 20 healthy volunteers using two types of pomegranate extracts (PEs). PEs with low (PE-1) and high (PE-2) punicalagin:EA ratio will be administered. The investigators will analyze blood and urine samples using UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. The investigators will evaluate:   -  The pharmacokinetics of EA.   -  The effect of punicalagin:free EA ratio on the pharmacokinetics of EA and urolithins production.    ,NCT02056496

Healthy,Metabolic and Physiological Stress During Skiing., Problem description In industrialized countries there is a rapid increase in the number of senior citizens. In Austria more than 50% of the population is overweight with highest prevalence in the age group from 60 to 74 yrs and the WHO lists physical inactivity as one of the main behavioral risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. Especially in winter months activity related energy expenditure was 40% and 31% lower in the US and Canada respectively. In addition in an Austrian study the winter season was associated with higher blood pressure total cholesterol and body mass index giving an increasing risk of chronic coronary disease by 6.8% in men and 3.6% in women. Therefore the development of intervention programs that overcome the winter physical activity deficit and be feasible also for elderly should be goal of future research. Alpine skiing (AS) and cross country skiing (XCS) have a long standing tradition in Austria and could potentially fill the winter physical activity gap. The Salzburg Skiing for the Elderly Study (SASES) has found AS to be a save and feasible possibility to improve the health of the aged population in many parameters. XCS as a competitive sport is already well explored but there are hardly any studies about its effects in the normal or elderly population. Unfortunately knowledge about the differences between AS and XCS in the physiological adaptation processes in the elderly population is also lacking. Aims and hypotheses of the pre-study In order to standardize training interventions the present pre-study aims at comparing physiological and metabolic parameters between AS XCS and IT. Therefore the results of the pre-study serve as determinants for the training parameters of the above mentioned main study. We postulate that based on the results of the present study it is possible to set up comparable isocaloric training sessions for AS XCS and IT for elderly and unfit persons. Furthermore we assume that elderly and unfit subjects are able to perform a full spectrum of intensities and techniques necessary to set appropriate stimuli for isocaloric comparison. We hypothesize arterial stiffness indices and circulating microRNA (miRNA) patterns to change due to one bout of physical activity of AS XCS and IT with variations depending on the kind of sport.    ,NCT02082106

Healthy,Lipidomics Screening of Anti-inflammatory Drugs and Drug Candidates in Vitro - Part A, Cardiovascular complications of NSAIDs selective for inhibition of COX-2 stimulated interest in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) as an alternative drug target. Global deletion of mPGES-1 in mice suppresses PGE2 and augments PGI2 by PGH2 substrate rediversion. Unlike COX-2 inhibition or gene deletion mPGES-1 deletion does not cause a predisposition to thrombogenesis and hypertension. However cell-specific deletion of mPGES-1 reveals that the predominant substrate rediversion product amongst the prostaglandins varies by cell type complicating drug development. We have developed an ultra performance liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) technique that allows the quantification of a wide range of lipids beyond the prostaglandin pathway (leukotrienes anandamide and the 2-arachidonylglycerol cascades). This study is designed to examine different pathway interventions from the arachidonic acid cascade by anti-inflammatory compounds (with a focus on mPGES-1 inhibition) in whole human blood in vitro (Part A) and ex vivo (Part B). In Part A whole human blood will be donated by healthy volunteers and treated with screening compounds in vitro (outside of the body). Experiments will be performed to measure an array of lipids in plasma and serum from pre-stimulated whole blood treated with a single or a combination of the test compounds. This study may reveal pathways previously unknown to be affected by the existing anti-inflammatory drugs and drug candidates and will possibly suggest new indications and/or side effects.    ,NCT02095288

Healthy,Caffeine Genetic Variation and Athletic Performance, Numerous studies have investigated the effect of caffeine on athletic performance but the findings have not been consistent. This is due in part to the differences in response that has been observed both within and between studies. Previous research in our lab has shown that genetic variations affecting caffeine metabolism modify the association between caffeine and heart disease. We hypothesize that the inconsistencies among studies relating caffeine and athletic performance may be due to genetic differences in caffeine metabolism or response. Male athletes will take part in an intervention of caffeine versus placebo using a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled design which will test various exercise protocols (power strength anaerobic capacity endurance) that are associated with performance across multiple sports. We will conduct a genome-wide association study which is an approach that involves scanning for markers across the genomes of our study participants together not individuals to find genetic variations associated with a particular trait such as VO2 max lactate clearance efficiency muscle fiber type and changes in exercise performance following caffeine. We will also examine known genetic variations that are associated with caffeine metabolism and response to determine if these genes also affect response to exercise after ingesting caffeine. Subjects will be paid $50.    ,NCT02109783

Healthy,The Effects of Caffeine on Pain-Based Pacing During a Cycling Time-Trial, Caffeine has been shown to consistently improve time-trial performance warranting restrictions on consumption under regulation of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). This ergogenic effect is not well understood possibly occurring as a result of altered metabolism improved strength and/or reduced muscle pain. The hypothesis of altered metabolism has recently fallen out of favor while muscular strength has a tenuous relationship with endurance exercise performance. Reductions in muscle pain have been observed during low and moderate intensity endurance exercise and this may be the mechanism of caffeine's ergogenic effect. In lieu of reducing pain during high intensity exercise caffeine significantly improves performance. Therefore caffeine appears to improve the amount of work that can be done for a given muscle pain rating suggesting that participants may pace based upon sensations of muscle pain during endurance exercise. Most time-trial exercise is conducted in a fixed distance manner measuring the time it takes participants to cover a given distance. Little research has been conducted on a fixed pain time-trial that would require participants to produce and sustain a given level of muscle pain while measuring the distance covered in an allotted time. A fixed pain time-trial could allow researchers to better understand the effect of pain on endurance performance. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of caffeine on a fixed pain time-trial.    ,NCT02115763
Healthy,Urine pH and Diet Net Acid Load," Presently the gold standard for testing diet acid intake is a urine collection done for many hours usually 24 hours which must be analyzed in a research lab for ""net acid excretion"". So getting information about diet acid intake is difficult. Many people have suggested doing a much simpler test which is checking the pH of the urine when you wake up. But no one has studied if this simpler method is a valid method for estimating the 24 hour net acid excretion.

Healthy,Effects of GABA Modulator AZD7325 on Cortical Excitability, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the main inhibitory compound in the human brain. Drugs that enhance its effects by binding on GABA receptors (e.g. benzodiazepines) are used to treat various diseases such as epilepsy insomnia anxiety or movement disorders. However the use of these medications is often compromised due to their side effects like sedation cognitive impairment and addiction. Many of these side effects have been linked to a particular type of GABA receptor (GABA A alpha 1). Therefore effort is being made to develop drugs that do not act on this receptor but maintain their beneficial properties by acting on other types of GABA receptors. AZD7325 is a drug that selectively acts on GABA A alpha 2 and A alpha 3 receptors but not A alpha 1. It has been tested in more than 700 people and so far proved to be generally well tolerated. Positron emission tomography (PET) study in humans demonstrated that AZD7325 binds to GABA A receptors in the brain after a single dose. Early clinical studies have shown that it has less sedative and cognitive adverse events as compared with a benzodiazepine lorazepam. In this study we will investigate its effects on short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). SICI is neurophysiological marker of inhibitory processes in the motor cortex. It is obtained non-invasively by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In TMS magnetic impulses applied over the scalp that in turn induce a current in a small area of the brain. If applied over the motor areas of the brain impulses result in muscle twitch that is recorded with surface electrodes. SICI is enhanced by certain drugs like benzodiazepines that act on GABA A alpha 123 and 5 receptor subtypes but not by zolpidem acting solely on alpha 1 subtype. Because GABA A alpha 5 receptor subtype is less common in the cortex it has been concluded that the drug effects on SICI are related to GABA A alpha 2 and alpha 3 receptors. If AZD7325 proves to enhance SICI in healthy volunteers this would create the grounds for the use of this medication to treat certain neurological disorders in which SICI has been found to be impaired (e.g. dystonia).    ,NCT02135198

Healthy,Study of Muscle Repair Following Exercise in Young and Elderly People, The aim of this study is to understand how healthy muscle repairs in response to eccentric exercise by evaluating functional metabolic and molecular measures. Furthermore this study will aim to understand the repair mechanisms in elderly healthy muscle following eccentric exercise by evaluating the same measures and highlighting age-related differences in repair mechanisms which may account for the age-related loss in muscle mass. It is hypothesised that elderly muscle will have a lesser/ blunted repair process compared to young muscle. To meet the aims of this study and to answer the hypothesis this study protocol is as follows: Baseline functional metabolic and molecular values are obtained via functional testing and a muscle biopsy. Participants then perform eccentric exercise designed to induce functional decline and muscle soreness and the contralateral leg performs concentric exercise which isn't designed to induce soreness or functional decline. Using a time-course various metabolic and molecular measures are taken prior to and up to 7 days post exercise to understand the mechanisms underlying muscle repair. In addition the use of a novel amino acid tracer (D2O) will allow for synthesis measures over the duration of the study rather than the typical tracer techniques which only capture ~12 hours of synthesis.    ,NCT02174692

Healthy,Test-Retest Variability of Quick Contrast Sensitivity Function Testing, The contrast sensitivity function (CSF) provides a comprehensive characterization of spatial vision and predicts functional vision better than visual acuity but long testing times prevent its psychophysical assessment in clinical applications. Dr. Luis Lesmes et al. (2010) developed the qCSF method to obtain precise CSF measurements in only 30-50 trials using a computerized software program that presents letters on a large monitor that are identified by a patient similar to typical visual acuity testing with an eye chart. The quick CSF method is a Bayesian adaptive method that estimates the full shape of the CSF and the test duration is only about 3-6 minutes. Some preliminary testing has been performed at other sites with this test in patients with vision loss due to amblyopia and glaucoma but data from individuals without eye disease who have normal visual acuity has not been systematically collected with the latest version of this test procedure across a wide range of ages. In addition we aim to gain a better understanding of the typical test-retest variability that is obtained between-sessions that are about a week apart from individuals with good ocular health and visual acuity.    ,NCT02177669

Healthy,Individual Response to Different Volumes of Resistance Training, The literature is not clear as to which training volume to employ during initial phases of resistance training programs to ensure optimal muscular adaptations. The purpose of this study is therefore to compare effects of strength training with low versus moderate volume on muscular function and hypertrophy in previously untrained healthy individuals. Furthermore the investigators will relate individual variation in responses to proxy markers of individual training state such as baseline muscular function and muscle fiber type. The study will include 25 women and 25 men and will consist of a 12-week resistance training protocol. Each study participant will act as their own control performing both the low- (1-set) and the moderate-volume (3-sets) protocol allocated to either the dominant or non-dominant leg in a stratified and randomized fashion. Primary outcome measures are thigh muscle cross section area and unilateral knee extension strength. Additionally muscle fiber type composition will be evaluated as well as additional parameters of muscular function. The primary hypothesis is that low-volume protocols will be beneficial for individuals with glycolytic muscle phenotypes whereas the opposite will be true for individuals with more aerobic phenotypes.    ,NCT02179307

Healthy,Effects of Dual-task Exercises on Gait Parameters and Cognitive Function in Elderly Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial, The training of a secondary task while walking whether it is reasoning activities memory or motor tasks may enhance automation walking performance and postural control and thus minimize the risk of falls influenced by the walking patterns variability. However the literature is scarce regarding the influence of dual-task training on changes in gait parameters. The purpose of this prospective blinded randomized controlled trial is to compare the short- and long-term effects of dual-task and aerobic training on gait stride variability and superior cerebral functions of independent community-dwelling elderly women. The participants will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control groups.The experimental group will undertake 50 minutes/day of dual-task training three times/week over 12 weeks totaling 36 sessions whereas the control group will receive the same doses of aerobic training. At baseline after 18 and 36 sessions and 12 weeks after the cessation of the interventions researchers blinded to group allocations will collect the outcome measures.The interventions will be delivered by trained physical therapists. Primary outcome will include gait stride variability which will be assessed by a movement analysis system: the GaitRite® system during cognitive and motor dual-tasks at both normal and fast speeds. Secondary outcome measures will include a battery of global and specific cognitive function tests. The findings of this trial may help better understand whether cognitive-motor interventions with older adults when compared to traditional aerobic training would result in greater improvements in gait under dual-task conditions and lead to improvements in cognitive tasks. Furthermore the findings could potentially bring important insights regarding the impacts of improvements in walking abilities and cognition.    ,NCT02185157

Healthy,Effect of Oral Health Ingredients on the Acquired Salivary Pellicle, The aim of this study is to help us understand how saliva forms a thin film inside the surfaces of the mouth which is known as the salivary pellicle and how this film helps to protect our teeth from decay. We know that the thickness and physical properties (viscosity and mechanical strength) of the salivary pellicle influences:-   -  How we chew and sense the structure of food in our mouth.   -  How we digest the food and extract nutrients from it.   -  Protection against tooth decay and infection. However studies have only recently established the different proteins within the pellicle. The effects of oral care products (e.g. toothpaste mouthwash etc.) and ingredients they contain on pellicle formation and removal remain poorly understood. Therefore we need to understand how the formation of the salivary pellicle is controlled by ingredients it comes into contact with such as those from food and oral hygiene products (e.g. toothpaste and mouthwash). In this study we are asking volunteers to provide samples of saliva. We will take the saliva samples back to our labs and measure how they form films under different conditions and determine the influence of ingredients from oral hygiene on the film forming properties. We will also measure the protein content of the saliva sample to see how this affects pellicle formation. Eventually this information together with knowledge from other studies should lead to the development of more effective oral hygiene products.    ,NCT02188238

Healthy,Comparison of the ECG Effects Related to Pharmacokinetic Profile of Chloroquine and Piperaquine, Chloroquine and piperaquine are the two most widely used antimalarial drugs ever. Hundreds of millions of people have received these drugs. Both are structurally similar and have cardiovascular effect. While there are no concerns over the use of chloroquine regulatory authorities have suggested restrictions on the use of piperaquine. We have recently completed a series of cross-over clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluations of chloroquine piperaquine pyronaridine and primaquine in healthy subjects. These studied were approved by the ethical committee of FTM. All drugs were well tolerated with no clinically significant ECG changes. Four subjects were in two studies. This offers a unique opportunity to compare the electrocardiographic effects of chloroquine and piperaquine in the same subjects and therefore characterize the concentration-effect relationships and thus relative safety. We propose to extend the previous subject study to recruit 16 subjects including those who have received either piperaquine or chloroquine in our previous studies so that 20 subjects received both drugs for a crossover comparison. The blood sampling schedule and electrocardiograms would be exactly the same as previously but would finish at 24 hours.    ,NCT02192944

Healthy,TEXTO : Total EXposure To Organic Pollutants, People are especially in industrialized countries exposed to a growing number of ubiquitous chemical substances. It thus increases human exposure pathways: diet inhalation soil and dust dermal contact?? notably for semi-volatile organic compounds. Diet is generally sought to contribute the most to total exposure for many chemicals the relative contribution of each pathway is nevertheless poorly described and can be different among populations. This is in particularly the case For young children who can be more exposed via the environment because of frequent contact with object and dust and hand to mouth behaviors. Children are in addition considered more sensitive to chemical risk due to their maturating systems. In this context the objective of this project is to characterize the young children's exposure to a particular class of semi volatile organic compounds. It will encompass the relative contribution of different pathways to the external dose and to try to match the internal and external doses with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for molecules for which it is possible. The present demand concerns a feasibility study on 2 children for Perfluorinated Alkylated Substances (PFAS) used in numerous consumer products.    ,NCT02210299

Healthy,Neurobiological Bases of Paternal Nurturance, The overall goal of this project is to identify the genetic hormonal and neurobiological influences on paternal nurturing behavior and to determine if fathers' neural responses to infants can be modulated by neuropeptides known to play a role in parenting in experimental animal models. The aim is to determine if pharmacological manipulation of central oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) levels influences the neural response to viewing pictures of one's own infant or to hearing cry stimuli. In a double-blind procedure fathers with 1-3 year old children will be scanned on two separate occasions; once under the influence of OT/AVP and once under the influence of placebo. Fathers will be randomized to either OT or AVP and order of administration of drug and placebo will counterbalanced across subjects. Fathers will be scanned while viewing pictures of their own and an unknown child and while listening to unknown infant cry stimuli. The investigators hypothesize:   -  OT will augment the ventral tegmental area (VTA) ventral striatum and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) response to viewing pictures of one's own child and will augment the primary auditory cortex (AI) response of fathers to infant cries.   -  AVP will augment the lateral septum response to viewing own child pictures.    ,NCT02223429

Healthy,Gut Microbiota and Proteins Intake, Gut microbiota are involved in the regulation of mammalian metabolic pathways through host-microbiota metabolic signaling and immune-inflammatory interactions that physiologically connect the gut liver brain and other organs. Correlation of these metabotypes with gut microbial profiles facilitates deciphering inherent host-microbe relationships. Microbiome sequencing have generated novel insights into the role of gut microbial composition in health and disease but are limited in addressing the microbial contribution to host metabolism and the gut microbial dysbiosis in disease. This is an exploratory trial aiming to examine how gut microbial conditions determine response to dietary challenge by measuring urine plasma and stool metabolites resulting from metabolism of protein polyamines and bile acids in combination with stool bacterial composition. The focus of this trial is to evaluate impact of protein based food challenges based on cross-over design of two diet challenges of animal and vegan protein sources.    ,NCT02223585

Healthy,Balance Control During Gait, Gait and balance disorders are important public health problem necessitating studies to try to prevent falls. Many studies have dealt with spatiotemporal gait parameters or balance during quiet standing (posturography). Nevertheless falls occurred predominantly during gait and rarely during quiet standing. We have developed a tool to measure balance during gait : the braking of the center of mass (CM) a biomechanical parameter obtained from the vertical velocity of the CM recorded with a force plate. In previous studies we have shown that the braking of the CM was a physiological and a active mechanism reflecting balance during gait. Unfortunately the braking of the CM measured on a force plate provide an important intra-individual variability. The 3D optoelectronic gait analysis system (VICON) also provide an estimation of the CM. The primary goal of this study is to compare intra-individual variability of the braking of the CM determined by a force plate or the 3D optoelectronic gait analysis system (VICON) in healthy subjects.    ,NCT02231827

Healthy,Family Milk Product Two-year Dose-response Study to Enhance Bone Health, The final stages in the development of peak bone mass (PBM) reside in late adolescence or early adulthood and are critical in the achievement of bone health. Optimization of PBM and maintenance of bone mineral density (BMD) are the best population health strategies in the primary prevention of osteoporosis. Diet and activity are key lifestyle factors in the primary prevention of osteoporosis as recognized in Canada's Food and Activity Guides. Dietary Reference Intakes are evidence-based regarding nutrition and bone health with a focus on calcium and vitamin D; yet the Food Guide and health behaviors are reliant on actual foods. The number of recommended servings of milk and alternatives varies by age with average intakes estimated to be below targets for all Canadians > 9 y of age. This is especially concerning during development of PBM. Therefore the global objective is to generate high-level evidence that dietary intervention with milk and milk products will enhance PBM in young men and women and maintenance of BMD in their parents. The primary objective is to demonstrate in healthy young men and women (14-18.9 y at baseline) with habitually low usual milk and milk product intakes that intervention with greater milk and milk product consumption improves lumbar spine BMD in a dose-response manner over 2 y (while accounting for body size physical activity demographics and age). Healthy young men and women will be recruited and screened for usual intake of milk and milk products. Those with low intakes < 2 servings of milk or milk products will be randomized (stratified by sex and age) to 1 of 3 groups for the RCT (n=10090/group): maintain usual low intakes (<1 serving) improved intakes (average of 2 servings/d) or recommended intakes (?? servings/d) of milk and milk products. A manualized motivational interviewing framework will be used for the interventions. Those meeting recommendations at screening will form a longitudinal cohort for 2 y. Key measurements include baseline and yearly assessment of BMD at multiple sites plus interim assessment of general health anthropometry dietary intakes physical activity and biomarkers of calcium homeostasis; and in the young adults bone metabolism.    ,NCT02236871

Healthy,Nasal LPS Challenge in Healthy Volunteers, The purpose of this study is to develop a nasal challenge model that causes a mild degree of inflammation without causing any pain or symptoms but that allows us to measure a variety of proteins in nasal secretions which causes inflammation in the nose. The nasal challenge model involves spraying the nostrils in the form of a fine mist with 4 different doses (1 10 30 and 100µg per nostril) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) including a placebo. LPS is a type of protein which has been carefully purified from the outer cell wall of certain bacteria is sterile and does not contain live bacteria and will not cause infection. The investigators will measure any inflammation in the nose by looking at cells collected by washing the inside of the nose (nasal lavage) and placing small strips of paper in the nasal cavity. The paper absorbs the nasal fluid and the chemicals produced during inflammation and can be extracted from the paper and analysed in the laboratory. The investigators will also be collecting a small amount of nasal epithelium taken by way of a nasal scrape; this is done by using a Rhinoprobe a small plastic curette which is used to scrape a small piece of lining of the nose.

Healthy,Circadian Brown Adipose Tissue Metabolism, Brown adipose tissue is poorly understood fat that can metabolize glucose in order to generate heat. Since activated brown fat has a high metabolic rate it is of great interest as a potential target to combat obesity. However the signaling and control of brown fat metabolism is poorly understood. Because brown fat uses glucose as its energy source brown fat metabolism can be imaged with PET/CT using the positron emitting glucose analog F-18 FDG. We have recently shown in mice a striking circadian variation in brown fat metabolism as evidenced by changes in FDG uptake. In this study we endeavor to generate pilot data on a potential circadian variation in brown fat activation in healthy humans.    ,NCT02285270

Healthy,"Occupation Based Health-Promotion Program for People Aged Over 60: ""Bliib Gsund"""," As in many other countries in the world the population in Switzerland is growing older. This also means an expansion of costs in the health system. Therefore the investigators need to find concepts of health promotion to prevent people from getting ill and dependent of the health care system. Our project aims at developing a health promotion program for persons over 50 years of age in a rural area of Switzerland. The program's name is ""bliib gsund"". This occupational-therapy directed health promotion program is conducted over a period of six months in two groups of eight persons each. The aim of the program is to enhance the quality of life of the participants to mediate the competence of integrating health-promoting aspects in their daily life and to maintain their independence in their life as long as possible. Persons over 50 often find themselves in a phase of transition in life such as starting retirement the loss of family members or children moving out. This program will provide them with the ability to continue their lifestyle in a more active way. It embraces topics such as more active pursuits of interests and carrying out personally meaningful activities. In preparation of the program the investigators conducted a needs analysis to identify the needs relating to health-promoting offers of the inhabitants living in the specified region. The results showed a high interest and need for such programs. They also helped us to identify several relevant issues to be included in the presented health-promotion program: physical exercise in daily life healthy nutrition getting acquainted with new technologies fall-prevention training and maintaining social contacts. The researchers and the designated occupational therapist who will be the moderator of the program can develop the program based on these results. The evaluation of the program should identify the effect of the program concerning the promotion of self-efficacy the sense of coherence quality of life and the program objectives. A questionnaire will be distributed before the program immediately after and six months after the program.    ",NCT02287155

Healthy,The Bioavailability Of Sulforaphane From Broccoli Soups Study (BOBS), There is current evidence that suggests eating cruciferous vegetables like broccoli cauliflower cabbage is beneficial to our health as they contain compounds which are thought to reduce the risk of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Cruciferous vegetables are able to deliver in our body a group of compounds called isothiocyanates (ITCs) that are thought to be responsible of their health-promoting effects. Sulforaphane (SF) from broccoli is one of the most studied ITCs and its anticancer properties have been extensively investigated in in vitro and in vivo models. The investigators propose to undertake an intervention study to measure the bioavailability of SF from the soups used in another intervention study called ESCAPE. The investigators would like to investigate the rate and extent to which SF reaches the systemic circulation and is excreted in urine by measuring SF and its metabolites in plasma and urine samples collected from apparently healthy participants after consumption of the three types of broccoli + stilton soups. The three types of soups are standard broccoli + stilton soups and two high-glucoraphanin (SF precursor) broccoli + stilton soups which are able to deliver different levels of SF.

Healthy,Bioequivalence Trial of Liquid Versus Freeze-Dried Pergoveris® in Pituitary Suppressed Healthy Premenopausal Female Subjects, Some women cannot have children because they cannot produce enough follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH). When this happens the ovaries fail to produce an egg during the menstrual cycle - a condition known as anovulation. Anovulation can be treated by giving replacement FSH and LH. Pergoveris is a medication that contains both FSH and LH. It is used for the treatment of anovulation in women who do not produce enough FSH and LH. A new liquid formulation of Pergoveris is being tested in this study. It will be compared with the current freeze-dried marketed formulation to see if the new formulation gets into the blood stream as easily as the current formulation. This study will involve 38 healthy female subjects and 2 treatment periods and will last for approximately 77 days. Each subject will receive a single dose of the new liquid formulation and a single dose of the current marketed formulation separated by an interval of two weeks in a randomised (by chance) order. Blood samples will be taken at regular intervals over 2 weeks after each dose to measure levels of FSH and LH. To participate female subjects must have normal ovaries on internal ultrasound scan a normal result from a cervical smear test be taking the combined oral contraceptive (OC) pill. Eligible subjects will have their usual OC pill replaced with another called Marvelon throughout the study. After 14 days subjects will have their levels of FSH and LH checked and if sufficiently reduced will only then proceed to dosing. Subjects will then receive one of the formulations. An ultrasound scan of the ovaries will be performed 7 days later and another one 7 days later just before the next dose. Subjects whose ovaries show signs of stimulation will not be given the second dose. The ultrasound scan will be repeated 7 days after the second dose.    ,NCT02317809

Healthy,The Effect of Whey Protein Consumed as a Pre-meal on Postprandial Lipemia in Healthy and Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes, Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most important and frequent causes of death. Postprandial lipidemia (PPL) is an independent risk factor for CVD besides the traditional risk factors e.g. hypertension high LDL-cholesterol family disposition of CVD and type 2 diabetes (T2D). A high PPL is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Reduction of increased PPL as a part of CVD prevention is therefore pivotal. Especially in groups with increased risk of CVD like the metabolic syndrome (MeS) and T2D. Identification of a simple diet-related method will possibly result in reduction of CVD in healthy as well as high-risk subjects. The aim of this project is to investigate the effect whey protein consumed as pre-meal prior to a fat-rich meal on responses of triglycerides and apolipoprotein B48 (ApoB48) in subjects with type 2 diabetes compared to healthy subjects. Secondarily the aim is to study the responses of glucose insulin glucagon amino acids inflammatory markers incretins rate of gastric emptying and metabolomics. Also satiety feeling will be measured. Investigators hypothesize that whey protein consumed 15 minutes prior to a fat-rich isocaloric meal reduces triglyceride- and ApoB48 responses more in type 2 diabetic subjects compared to healthy subjects. The investigators research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of how PPL can be modified in a simple manner. It will promote innovation to the food industry for development and production of healthy food products which can be applied in the fight against CVD in the background population in general and high-risk people in particular. Thus the results of this project can impart knowledge of great importance both to the national and international food industry as well as the healthcare systems.    ,NCT02343471

Healthy,Effects of Barley on Glucose Control, Lifestyle modifications that include a diet high in fibre may lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (CDA 2013). In this context the presence of soluble dietary fibre in carbohydrate rich foods has been widely recognized for its effect on post-prandial glucose response (PPGR). Among these oat and barley derived β-glucan have received tremendous attention for their biological effects including their ability to reduce PPGR in a wide variety of food matrices (Poppitt et al 2007). A health claim for PPGR would increase market demand for food grade barley and help those who want to limit the rise in blood sugar after a meal choose products to meet their goals but there are several gaps in the literature that need to be filled before a submission to Health Canada can be successful: 1) test foods in appropriate serving sizes; 2) test both the glucose and insulin response; 3) include a reference product that matches in total fibre macronutrient and energy profile; 4) perform dose response. The proposed study design will address all of these gaps in the current literature and take into consideration Health Canada's guidance document for health claims related to the reduction in PPGR which sets out the criteria by which the validity of such claims will be assessed. Hypothesis: Barley β-glucan will reduce the PPGR in healthy participants in a dose dependent manner. Specific objectives:   1. To determine the minimum and most effective dose of barley β-glucan in quick bread on PPGR and insulin response in a cross-over randomized controlled clinical trial.   2. To assess the effect of barley β-glucan in a quick bread on appetite-related sensations using visual analog scales.   3. To demonstrate whether the test and reference products were liked or disliked similarly by participants.   4. To assess any gastrointestinal side effects from eating the test products    ,NCT02367989

Healthy,Interval Training Plus Creatine Effects on Performance and Glucose Tolerance, Recent evidence suggests that high -intensity interval training (HIIT) may be an effective strategy to improve cardiorespiratory fitness exercise performance and insulin sensitivity. In addition creatine (Cr) a nitrogen- containing compound is widely used to enhance high intensity exercise performance. A seminal study demonstrated that the muscle content of Cr and phosphocreatine (PCr) can be elevated by exogenous Cr. Oral intake of Cr increases the concentration in blood and muscle and part of the increased muscle Cr is transformed to PCr (a process catalyzed by Cr kinase). Cr supplementation increases total Cr (TCr = Cr + PCr) by ~20% with the PCr component accounting for 10% of the increase. Combining HIIT and Cr is intriguing for two reasons; first Cr supplementation improves performance through increasing PCr PCr recovery and muscle buffering which may facilitate higher training intensities and therefore greater training adaptations. Secondly both Cr and HIIT have individually been shown to increase GLUT 4 and insulin sensitivity suggesting that Cr supplementation may be an adjunct to HIIT for improving glucose control. To date there have only been two studies investigating the performance effects of Cr combined with HIIT with preliminary positive results. No studies have examined the impact of combined Cr + HIIT on outcomes related to insulin sensitivity. Therefore the purpose of this research is to examine the combined effects of Cr and HIIT on performance and insulin sensitivity as determined via an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in young healthy adults.    ,NCT02370212

The subjects receive the capsules after the last pre-measurement and continue to take them throughout the post-measurements. Before and after the supplementation period we perform a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with a glucose-tracer infusion to assess hepatic and systemic insulin sensitivity. Simultaneously substrate oxidation is measured throughout the clamp by indirect calorimetry. Furthermore we perform a high-fat mixed meal test in which we collect blood and measure substrate oxidation during fasted and postprandial conditions. During the meal tests extra plasma is collected at the start (t=-30) and the end (t=240) of which the supernatant is stored in light-protected tubes (EGCG is mixed 1:1 with an EGCG buffer) for analyzing polyphenol concentrations in the blood. In the male subgroup (21 men) we additionally place each 2 microdialysis probes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue and the gastrocnemius in order to assess local lipolysis and blood flow by means of ethanol infusion. Furthermore a dexa-scan is performed to assess body composition and biopsies are taken under fasted conditions from the subcutaneous adipose tissue and the quadriceps femoralis muscle. These samples are stored at -80C. Part of the adipose tissue samples is collected to measure adipocyte size. Of the skeletal muscle biopsy one part is directly buffered and used for the oxygraph to measure mitochondrial function. At last feces samples are collected before and after the intervention in order to assess energy content microbial composition and short-chain fatty acid content. Based on previous human studies in our and other departments we hypothesize that after 12 weeks of the combined polyphenol supplementation insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function improve. Furthermore based on results of a short-term study performed by our group that demonstrated an increase in energy expenditure a positive effect on the regulation of body composition might be expected.    ,NCT02381145

Healthy,Particle Sizing of Masticated Tree Nuts - Cashews and Walnuts, The investigators want to understand how oral processing (chewing) of nuts affects particle size and the presence of lipid (fat) on the cut surfaces. The main objective of the study is to: Measure the size of nut particles that have been chewed sufficiently to be swallowed. The secondary objective of this study is to: Measure any changes in lipid content due to chewing and compare it to a prediction from a theoretical model. The investigators have developed a theoretical model for determining the release of nutrients from plant foods specifically lipid (fat) from almonds. The model has been used to calculate the amount of lipid released from chewed almonds. The model shows that only about 10% of the lipid is immediately released. The investigators require information on the particle size distribution (number of particles of each size) for other chewed nuts to calculate the amount of lipid released for other nuts. This will allow us to check the validity of our model for other foods.    ,NCT02398084

Healthy,CYP2B6 Genetics and Drug Interactions in Healthy Volunteers, The CYP2B6 enzyme metabolizes a growing number of clinically important drugs such as the anti-HIV drug efavirenz but its activity in the liver is highly variable which may lead to failure of therapy or toxicity and unpredictable drug interactions. Genetic and several nongenetic factors affect the activity of CYP2B6. The goal of this study is to determine the impact of simultaneous autoinhibition/autoinduction and CYP2B6 genetics on CYP2B6 activity efavirenz exposure and efavirenz-mediated drug interactions. The pharmacokinetics and drug interactions will be determined on three occasions in a total of 60 healthy volunteers. The whole study will have 4 phases. A) Phase 1 (baseline control): using selective probe substrates the baseline activities of CYP2B6 (bupropion) CYP2C8 (montelukast) and OATP1B1 (rosuvastatin) are determined. B) Phase 2 (inhibition): the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of a single 600 mg oral dose of efavirenz) and the activities of CYP2B6 CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 (inhibition) are determined. C) Phase 3 (treatment phase): After completing phase 2 subjects take 600 mg/day efavirenz at home for 17 days. C) Phase 4 (induction and inhibition): At the end of phase 3 steady state metabolism and pharmacokinetics of efavirenz and the activities of CYP2B6 CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 will be determined. Efavirenz serves as a model substrate inhibitor and inducer of CYP2B6 (and other drug disposition proteins). Bupropion 4-hydroxylation is an alternative in vivo probe of CYP2B6 activity and will be studied here in addition to the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of efavirenz.    ,NCT02401256

Healthy,PET Study of Cerebral Metabolism of 11C-acetoacetate and 18F-FDG in Patients Under Moderate Ketosis, Regional brain glucose hypometabolism occurs during aging and may contribute to the onset of aging-related cognitive impairment in humans. Ketones are the main alternative energy substrate to glucose for the brain. Several studies show that brain ketone uptake and metabolism are unaltered in cognitively-normal older persons and in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nutritional ketosis is reported to have a positive impact on cognitive performances in mild cognitive impairment and AD. Nevertheless changes in regional brain glucose and ketone uptake in adults are poorly understood during diet-induced experimental ketosis. The investigators hypothesis was that during diet-induced ketosis brain ketone uptake would be directly correlated with the elevation of blood ketone levels and inversely correlated to brain glucose uptake.    ,NCT02409784
Healthy,Effect of MCT Emulsification on Ketogenesis in Human Adults, Lower brain glucose uptake is present before the onset of cognitive deterioration and may increase the risk of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Ketones are the brain's main alternative energy substrates. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are rapidly beta-oxidized and are ketogenic. Large doses of MCT oil are linked to gastro-intestinal side effects due to incomplete absorption so the investigators examined whether homogenisation into a skim milk matrix (MCT-H) would both improve ketogenesis and reduce side-effects compared to MCT taken without homogenisation into a matrix (bulk MCT [MCT-B]). Hypotheses: (i) MCT-H will be better absorbed compared to MCT-B so MCT-H will result in higher ketonemia and lower side effects in healthy adults. (ii) The effects of MCT-B and MCT-H on ketogenesis will be dose-dependent.    ,NCT02409927
Healthy,Effect of Immersion Performed Under the Conditions of Obstetrical Dilatation Bath on Diuresis and Hemodynamic Variables in Young Women, Like in the full immersion studied in the context of diving immersion in water causes a cascade of events with hemodynamic and hormonal consequences. First immersion leads to a relative hypervolemia by venous redistribution and then 40-60 minutes later hypovolemia by stimulating diuresis. Dilatation bath is helpful in relieving moderate pain the first stage of obstetrical labor. However when the labor progresses the dilatation bath is no longer sufficient and epidural analgesia remains the only effective method to control pain. Used before the realization of an epidural analgesia dilatation bath could affect blood volume and thus worsen the hemodynamic consequences of the sympathetic block that is linked to the installation of sensory block of the epidural analgesia in the parturient (severe prolonged maternal hypotension that can cause a decrease of the placental perfusion and fetal distress). Before beginning a study in pregnant women it seems essential to study the hemodynamic consequences of the dilatation bath in a comparable population of volunteers healthy young women and out of the obstetrical context.    ,NCT02409953
Healthy,Effect of an Alpha-linolenic Acid-rich Supplement on Ketogenesis and Plasma Fatty Acids, Background: As the main alternative fuel to glucose for the brain increased plasma ketones could potentially help compensate for brain glucose hypometabolism occurring during aging. The precursor long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) α-linolenic acid (ALA) is normally mostly β-oxidized and so could potentially be used to stimulate ketogenesis in humans. Objective: To compare the impact of an ALA-rich supplement on the ketogenic response in young and older healthy adults. Design: Ten young and ten older adults will consume a flaxseed oil supplement providing 2 g/d of ALA for 4 weeks. Plasma ketones free fatty acids triglycerides glucose and insulin will be measured over 6 h during two metabolic study days one before and one at the end of the supplementation. Hypothesis: ALA-rich supplement for 4 weeks will increase ketone production in both groups.    ,NCT02410161

However cell-specific deletion of mPGES-1 reveals that the predominant substrate rediversion product amongst the prostaglandins varies by cell type complicating drug development. The research team has developed an ultra performance liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) technique that allows the quantification of a wide range of lipids beyond the prostaglandin pathway (leukotrienes anandamide and the 2-arachidonylglycerol cascades). This study is designed to examine different pathway interventions from the arachidonic acid cascade by anti-inflammatory compounds (with a focus on mPGES-1 inhibition) in whole human blood in vitro (Part A) and ex vivo (Part B). In Part B healthy volunteers will be asked to take a single therapeutic dose of celecoxib and blood and urine samples will be collected before and after drug administration. Collected blood will be stimulated ex vivo and lipids and their metabolites will be measured in blood and urine respectively. The investigators expect that lipid profile from ex vivo hWBA done on celecoxib-treated subjects will recapitulate findings from the in vitro hWBA received with celecoxib-treated human blood (Part A).    ,NCT02413203

Healthy,Standardized 1µg Adrenocorticotropic Hormone Stimulation Test and Salivary Cortisol Concentration During the Test, Study objectives: First to determine whether intravenous injection of 1 mcg adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) through short cannula in healthy participants provides reliable results of cortisol response and whether this method would replace the conventional technique of injecting ACTH by a needle directly into a peripheral vein. Secondly to determine salivary free cortisol concentration during the test in healthy controls. Rationale of study: Intravenous injection of synthetic ACTH1-24 concentration through venous short cannula appears to be feasible and simple method. On the other hand injection of ACTH1-24 by a needle directly into peripheral vein is not infrequently complicated by technical problems in subjects with challenging veins. The investigators suppose that both methods would have the same yield in predicting cortisol response. Salivary free cortisol test has an evolving importance in assessing the adrenal function. This test would be reliable for use in low dose ACTH stimulation (1 mcg) test. The investigators will examine the concentration of salivary free cortisol during ACTH stimulation test in order to determine level range in normal controls.    ,NCT02413944

Healthy,Temperature Evaluation by MRI Thermometry During Cervical Cooling, The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends cooling (inducing mild hypothermia) patients who were resuscitated following cardiac arrest but who remained comatose. Induced mild hypothermia is now the standard of care for post-resuscitation patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. The use of cooling has recently moved to pre-hospital and emergency department (ED) application as more current studies show that early initiation of cooling significantly improves neurologic outcomes and survival rates instead of waiting until the patient arrives in the ICU to initiate cooling. In the pre-hospital setting chilled saline (4°C) and packing the body in ice have been the primary methods to initiate induced mild hypothermia The Excel Cryo Cooling System is a non-invasive cervical collar (C-collar) that provides cooling to the carotid arteries the main blood supply to the brain and allows for the rapid initiation of selective cerebral cooling. The investigators are planning to use MRI-thermometry to see how quickly the Excel Cryo Cooling Collar can drop brain temperature when applied by itself. Healthy volunteers will be used for this study to provide important temperature data on the effectiveness of the Excel Cryo Cooling System. The investigators will be able to use the data from this project to further the current clinical research in induced mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest.    ,NCT02431026
Healthy,Low-fidelity Simulation to Teach Anesthetists' Non-technical Skills in Rwanda," The goal of this study is to examine whether low?fidelity instructor?driven simulation can provide effective teaching of anesthetists' non?technical skills in a developing world context. Human factors such as communication planning and team working are considered nontechnical skills which contribute greatly to patient safety in ""complex hazardous systems"" such as aviation nuclear power industry and operating rooms. Simulation began in the aviation industry to train pilots in human factors. In the past two decades simulation has been valued in medical education as it allows the learner to rehearse skills in an environment that is similar to the workplace but without the threat of harm to patients. High Fidelity simulators involve computer driven interactive mannequins that recreate an authentic environment. This has been used successfully to teach anesthetists' non?technical skills (ANTS) such as: decision making team working task management and situation awareness. Anesthetists' non?technical skills are particularly important in developing countries where the shortage of supplies equipment and qualified personnel can lead to a perilous working environment making team work and communication vital for patient safety. The costs of high fidelity simulation are prohibitive for many developing countries. This study seeks to examine whether low fidelity instructor driven simulation can provide an effective intervention to teach anesthetists' non?technical skills in Rwanda. If found to be effective this method of training could be applied to other developing countries to improve non?technical skills for anesthesia providers with the goal of making surgery safer.

Healthy,Dose Adaptation to Offset the Interaction Between Ticagrelor and Ritonavir by Population-based PK Modeling, Ticagrelor is a new generation antiplatelet agent with higher efficacy as compared to clopidogrel and prasugrel in treatment of patients with moderate and high ischemic risks. Ticagrelor is active as such and its hepatic metabolism by CYP3A generates also an active metabolite. Because of the remarkable progress in HIV therapies the number of older age patients is on the rise requiring adequate cardiovascular treatment. Since frontline HIV therapies include ritonavir a strong inhibitor of CYP3A enzyme ticagrelor is contraindicated in these patients because of the expected interaction and bleeding risk. A lower efficacy of clopidogrel and prasugrel which are both pro-drugs in the presence of ritonavir has been already demonstrated. Therefore administration of a lower dose of ticagrelor may be a good alternative in HIV patients in order to lessen the impact of this pharmacokinetic interaction. The aim of this study is to adjust the dose of ticagrelor in case of co-treatment with ritonavir to achieve the same pharmacokinetic profile as administered alone using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. As the first step a pharmacokinetic (PK) model for ticagrelor and its active metabolite will be created based on available in vitro and in vivo parameters in healthy volunteers. An open-label 2 sessions cross over study will be conducted with 20 healthy male volunteers at Clinical Research Center (CRC) of Geneva University Hospitals (HUG). During the first session of the clinical trial a single dose 180 mg ticagrelor will be administered to the volunteers and obtained pharmacokinetic data will be fitted into the model for optimization. Thereafter a simulated trial by the Simcyp® simulator in presence of a single dose 100 mg ritonavir will allow evaluating the impact of CYP3A inhibition on the concentration-time profile of ticagrelor and its active metabolite. The necessary dose of ticagrelor to minimize the magnitude of this interaction will be calculated. This new dose will be co-administered with ritonavir in the same volunteers during the second session of the clinical trial. The purpose is to obtain the same PK profile with single dose of 180 mg ticagrelor administered alone and with an adapted dose of ticagrelor co-administered with a single dose 100 mg ritonavir. Moreover the pharmacodynamic effect of ticagrelor will be measured in both sessions of the clinical trial using two specific platelet function tests: the VAsodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein assay (VASP) and VerifyNow® P2Y12. With the same PK profile the same pharmacodynamic activity is expected. The modulation of activity of CYP3A and P-gp by ritonavir will be also monitored using micro dose midazolam and fexofenadine as probe substrates. The purpose of this study is to use the Simcyp® Simulator mechanistic PBPK modeling to broaden the application field of ticagrelor especially in HIV patients. Since PK models are often created after clinical observations the prospective aspect of this study is of particular value as the model will be first created and then applied to an unknown clinical scenario.    ,NCT02435563

Healthy,Particle Sizing of Masticated Tree Nuts - Pistachios and Brazils, The investigators want to understand how oral processing (chewing) of nuts affects particle size and the presence of lipid (fat) on the cut surfaces. The main objective of the study is to: Measure the size of nut particles that have been chewed sufficiently to be swallowed. The secondary objective of this study is to: Measure any changes in lipid content due to chewing and compare it to a prediction from a theoretical model. The investigators have developed a theoretical model for determining the release of nutrients from plant foods specifically lipid (fat) from almonds. The model has been used to calculate the amount of lipid released from chewed almonds. The model shows that only about 10% of the lipid is immediately released. The investigators require information on the particle size distribution (number of particles of each size) for other chewed nuts to calculate the amount of lipid released for other nuts. This will allow us to check the validity of our model for other foods.    ,NCT02497768

Healthy,Substrate Metabolism Growth Hormone Signaling and Insulin Sensitivity During Fasting, Background: Calorie restriction increases longevity in many species and attenuate the development of chronic disorders including type 2 diabetes cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In mice reduced activity of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and/or insulin is associated with extended longevity. Growth hormone (GH) is the main regulator of IGF-I production but the molecular mechanism whereby GH switches from IGF-I stimulation (protein anabolism) to fatty acid oxidation (fatty acid catabolism) as well as induction of insulin resistance during fasting remains enigmatic. Hypotheses: The changes of the global set of metabolites induction of insulin resistance and the shift in metabolism from protein anabolism to lipolysis together with the potentially favorable effect of calorie restriction during fasting depend on preserved fasting-induced GH secretion. Aim: The investigators wish to provide knowledge on changes in metabolites and shift in signaling pathways that take place at the transition to the fasting state among healthy overweight and obese subjects. Furthermore the investigators wish to determine the effect of GH on the adaption of the metabolism to a fasting state.    ,NCT02500095

Healthy,Application of Deuterated Water (D2O) to Define the Etiology of Musculoskeletal Decline in Ageing and the Efficacy of Nutritional Supplementation, Maintaining muscle mass and function is important in healthy ageing to maintain quality of life. Loss of muscle mass is major problem as beyond the age ~50 muscle mass declines by ~1-2% a year. To prevent this loss the investigators need to understand the mechanism regulating muscle mass as we age. In this project the investigators aim to determine these mechanisms using a new technique of heavy water ingestion this allows measurement of multiple aspects of skeletal muscle mass metabolism e.g. protein synthesis over long periods (6 weeks) as people go about their normal everyday activities.

Healthy,Influence of Gravity on the Size-mass Illusion, Parabolic flight is the only ground-based condition in which free-fall (0G) can be created long enough for safely testing changes in human perception and behavior. In addition to the 0G period parabolic flight generates equal duration periods of 1.8G which present another unique opportunity to test the same responses to hypergravity and back to 1G. It is well known that performance decrements occur in astronauts during and after gravity level transitions. Illusions are commonly felt in orbit as well disorientation and perceptual limitations mainly due to both psycho-physiological changes and adaptation and lack of familiar points of reference in the space environment. Studies performed during previous space missions showed several changes occurring in different gravity conditions pointing out for example that colors and shadows were misleading the depth and distance perception were weakened and the linear perspective was lost. Visual perception is of primary importance for spatial orientation and object recognition because the static vestibular (otolithic) and proprioceptive signals are absent when free-floating. Consequently astronauts become increasingly dependent on vision to perceive motion and orientation. All these factors play an important role in the adaptation of humans to spaceflight that needs to be analyzed to understand the underlying mechanisms that regulate human psycho-physiological adaptive process to changing gravity. Human psycho-physiological health has to be safeguarded and possibly improved when long-term human space missions are programmed in the near future. The primary objective of this experiment is to investigate if the SWI illusion is present in altered gravity environments. Since weight cannot be estimated in 0G investigators have developed a procedure during which the subject is asked to estimate the objects' mass by shaking them rather than lifting them. Our results in 1G indicate that a size-mass illusion (SMI) is also present in 1G. Our hypothesis is that the previously observed alteration in 3D visual perception in 0G particularly in the height of 3D objects as well as the change in proprioceptive inputs will be responsible for changes in the SMI in 0G and 1.8G compared to 1G. In a separate proposal investigators will also propose to perform this experiment using the ESA short-arm human centrifuge (SAHC) with subjects exposed to various centrifugal force levels to further investigate the role of proprioceptive cues in the size-mass illusion.    ,NCT02507453

Healthy,The Mineral Water of Vichy and the Urinary Alkalization: A Study of the Dose - Effect of Bicarbonate Salt Water on the Urinary pH in Healthy Volunteers," Vichy water is a type of spring water which traditionally comes from the famous spa town of Vichy France. The springs which feed Vichy carry a high amount of dissolved minerals. Alkaline salts such as sodium bicarbonate are a primary ingredient in Vichy water along with calcium and magnesium carbonates. Bicarbonates alkalinize urine which is fundamental in preventing and/or diluting uric acid crystals. These are the main component of the uric acid stones or even oxalate stones which generally "" use "" a crystal of uric acid as nucleus for stone formation. Cystine stones can also be treated by alkalinizing urine. Any disorder leading to a low urinary pH ( < 5.5 ) may predispose to stone formation. In this context  the solution of uric acid and the prevention and treatment of uric acid stones can be obtained by alkalization of the urine . The ideal alkalization is achieved when a urinary pH of 6-6.5 can be reached. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quantity of daily intake of the Vichy water necessary to obtain this alkalization of the urine. There are no data available in the literature about the relationship between the absolute quantity of Vichy water taken and the urinary pH ; nor about the possible influence of the Body Mass Index on this relationship.

Healthy,Coherence Between Brain Cortical Function and Neurocognitive Performance During Changed Gravity Conditions, Alongside a well-known physiological deconditioning such as a decrease in muscle mass or bone demineralization extended stays in weightlessness also cause cognitive dysfunction. However the studies on this subject during space missions short or long term could not determine how these cognitive dysfunction resulted from a direct effect of weightlessness or a stress-related effect. Analysis of electro-encephalography (EEG) using a standardized mapping method is used to study the changes of operation of the cerebral cortex as the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a reflection of changes in the cerebral hemodynamics. Their combined use is a relatively simple and economical method for studying brain changes in an environment where the normal brain imaging techniques can not be used. The main objective of this experiment is to evaluate the alterations in brain cortical activity and brain oxygenation level induced by micro- and hypergravity conditions.    ,NCT02516787

Healthy,Alterations in Autonomic Cardiovascular Control Induced at Partial G Forces, As a direct consequence of exposure to microgravity astronauts experience a number of physiological changes which can lead to serious medical implications. Most immediate and significant is the headward shift of body fluids and the removal of gravitational loading from bone and muscles resulting in progressive changes of the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. The cardiovascular systems is subject to rapid changes which has been demonstrated in studies of short term (shuttle) and long term missions to Skylab and MIR. Our main hypothesis is that there is a linear relationship between the gravity level (0G 0.16G 0.38G 1G 1.8G) and the cardiovascular parameters (heart rate (HR) heart rate variability (HRV) blood pressure and blood pressure variability (BPV) as well the spectral analysis of HRV and BPV.    ,NCT02517177
Healthy,Effects of Repeated Short-term Microgravity During Parabolic Flight Conditions on Neuro-endocrine Immune and Metabolic Changes, From previous parabolic flight campaigns completed by our research group investigators gathered data showing important changes in neuro?endocrine and also immunological changes. This experiment now will complete the data set?up obtained during the MARS500 study on how these respective individuals will re?act to highly physically and emotionally challenging situations during a parabolic flight. This add?on experiment to MARS500 will enable answering to the following questions i) if the stress response systems - when compared for two conditions but in the same individuals - do react uniformly and ii) if those subjects prone to have adequate stress response pattern will show gradually less immune modulation effects. The understanding of the complex interactions of stress and immunity under chronic and acute stress conditions might help to enable adequate health and immune monitoring and might as well suggest suitable countermeasures for the prevention of the unwanted immunological effects during long?term confinement and space missions.    ,NCT02517190
Healthy,Parabolic Flight Induced Neuroplasticity Studied With Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Methods, Weightlessness profoundly modifies many physiological systems and especially the nervous system and the vestibular system. The changes in the nervous system are based in part on brain plasticity mechanisms that is to say on modifications of neurons and their connections. They are the source of some of the behavioral response observed in the parabolic flight or in astronauts. For example it is commonly observed that in the second and third days of parabolic flight campaigns with 3 flights fewer participants are prone to motion sickness during the first day. Similarly during their first trip into space astronauts suffer 2/3 for 2 or 3 days of space sickness - special form of motion sickness - while this proportion is much lower in the second trip. The hypothesis of this study is that short-term weightlessness as well as changes in the level of gravity experienced during parabolic flights induce neuroplascity phenomena in brain regions involved in the integration of vestibular visual and proprioceptive. The goal is to objectify these plasticity phenomena and assess their changes over time using methods of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A standard MRI will give an anatomical image of the brain. For this study a variant called diffusion MRI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging - DTI) will visualize nerve bundles and their journey in the brain. The total duration of this review will be about ¾ hour. The results of this study will be compared with those of an ongoing study of 12 astronauts who have the same MRI scans taken before and after a trip to the International Space Station. Investigators can then evaluate the effect of duration of exposure to weightlessness on the phenomena of neuroplasticity.    ,NCT02517216

Healthy,Relative Bioavailability of Two Different Milk Thistle Formulations, This is a single dose randomized cross-over pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers (n=12) of two dietary supplement formulations. The Product B® IsaGenesis® formulation represents a newer reformulation of an existing product known simply as IsaGenesis®. Beyond some changes in the relative abundance of some of the constituents of the earlier IsaGenesis® formulation the Product B® IsaGenesis® product has been formulated as a liquid-gel formulation (rather than a dried powder extract) which is theorized to enhance the absorption and bioavailability of the contained botanical constituents. The purpose of this study is to compare the two dietary supplement formulations relative to the absorption of two compounds contained within the supplement known as the flavonolignans silybin A and silybin B into the bloodstream after oral administration of capsules.    ,NCT02529605

Healthy,Effects of GABA Modulator AZD7325 on Cutaneous Sensation, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. For years drugs that enhance its effects (e.g. benzodiazepines such as diazepam/Valium) have been used to treat various diseases such as epilepsy insomnia anxiety or movement disorders. However the use of these medications is often compromised because of their side effects such as sleepiness memory problems and addiction. Therefore effort has been made to develop drugs that act more selectively in the brain to exert the positive therapeutic effects and are devoid of the unwanted side effects. AZD7325 is one of these drugs. It has been tested in more than 700 people and so far proved to be generally well tolerated. Positron emission tomography (PET) study in humans demonstrated that AZD7325 binds to GABA A receptors in the brain after a single dose. Early clinical studies have shown that it has less sedative and cognitive adverse events as compared with a benzodiazepine lorazepam. The investigators now wish to evaluate if effects of AZD7325 can be objectively measured in healthy volunteers and to establish which of the drug's outcomes could be utilised for further studies in patients with neurological diseases. The investigators are especially interested in the effects of AZD7325 on manual dexterity and skin sensation of the hand. This can be assessed by a number of simple non-invasive tests of object manipulation and detection of different sensory stimuli such as touch vibration or temperature. Recent studies show that healthy individuals who performed better in similar tasks had more GABA in relevant areas of their brain. If performance in these tasks in healthy volunteers can be improved by enhancing GABA effects in the brain with AZD7325 this would create the grounds for the use of this medication to treat symptoms of certain neurological disorders in which motor control and sensation of the hand is impaired (e.g. polyneuropathy).    ,NCT02530580

Healthy,Normative Values Laser Nociceptive Evoked Potentials Depending on the Age, Different neurological damage may alter the pain conduction systems centrally (spinothalamic pathway) or peripherally (small caliber sensory fibers A delta and C). The laser thermal stimulation selectively stimulates the pain pathways and generates nociceptive signals conveyed to the cortex. Registering these cortical responses constitute the technical laser nociceptive evoked potentials. If these tests are routinely used their interpretation must remain cautious especially in the elderly.    ,NCT02531048

Healthy,Measurement of Total Retinal Blood Flow During Flicker Stimulation in Healthy Subjects, Neurovascular coupling or functional hyperemia is defined as an essential physiologic mechanism in the brain which is necessary for the local adaption of blood flow to altered metabolic demands of the tissue. It has been shown that also in the eye blood flow is considerably coupled to retinal neural activity. The current concept of functional hyperemia is that visual stimulation as flicker light effectuates increasing neural activity in the retina which elevates the metabolic needs of the retinal tissue for oxygen and glucose and consequently induces dilatation and augmented blood flow in the retinal vasculature. In several studies stimulation with flicker light has been shown to induce an increase of blood flow in major retinal arteries and veins as well as an increase of optic nerve head blood flow. Up until now flicker induced changes in blood flow were measured solely in the major retinal arteries and veins with systems such as the commercially available dynamic vessel analyzer (DVA) by Imedos and with laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). In the present study the investigators propose to measure the response of total retinal blood flow to diffuse luminance flicker stimulation with bi-directional Fourier Domain Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography (FDOCT) as well as with Laser Speckle Flowgraphy (LSFG) in healthy subjects by assessing vessel diameter blood velocity and blood flow of all retinal vessels. For comparative reasons the investigators will furthermore assess the blood flow of major retinal arteries and veins with the dynamic vessel analyzer (DVA) and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV).    ,NCT02531399

Healthy,Effects of E-smoke on Levels of Endothelial Progenitor Cells and Microparticles in Healthy Volunteers, We plan to investigate the acute effects of inhaling e-cigarette vapor on cell function measured by microvesicles and endothelial progenitor cells. Micro vesicles are released upon either activation or apoptosis from different cell types such as platelets leucocytes and endothelial cell. Endothelial progenitor cells are a type of stem cells that circulate in the blood with the ability to differentiate to endothelial cells. Endothelial progenitor cells are inversely correlated to cardiovascular risk factors. As a secondary endpoint we plan to investigate exhaled nitric oxide - a common inflammation marker used in asthmatic patients - after inhalation of electronic cigarette vapor.    ,NCT02532894
Healthy,Effect of Simvastatin Withdrawal on Ocular Endothelial Function, Statins are drugs representing the most commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In a recently published study discontinuation of statin therapy in patients after acute myocardial infarction was associated with a higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 345) and a higher cardiac mortality (hazard ratio 465). Increasing evidence suggests that statins also have vasoactive properties by up-regulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with positive effects on endothelial function. Experiments with flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) showed these positive effects of statin treatment on endothelial function but also revealed that withdrawal of statin treatment transiently worsens endothelial function independently of serum cholesterol levels. Consequently this placebo controlled Phase IV crossover study wants to assess changes of endothelial function in terms of flicker induced vasodilatation before and during statin therapy as well as after statin withdrawal. For this purpose 20 healthy subjects will be treated with 40 mg/day of simvastatin for a period of 4 weeks. Flicker induced vasodilatation and retinal oxygen saturation will be measured with the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer system by Imedos at baseline in the 4th week of simvastatin or placebo intake as well as 3 7 and 14 days after the end of intake.    ,NCT02533141
Healthy,Fructose and Ethnic Differences Study (FED Study), In the UK people of black West African and Caribbean's tend to have healthier blood cholesterol and blood fat levels as well as lower incidence of heart disease/heart attack. But rates of heart disease are now rising in young African-American populations with diabetes for the first time exceeding the rate in their white European-American peers. One possible culprit is the increasing consumption of fructose which can lead to high blood fat levels. Fructose is a natural sugar found in fruits and table sugar but is also used the food industry as an ingredient and sweetener. Because fructose intakes are lower in the UK than in North America we are studying the effect of fructose intake in UK black West African and Caribbean people to understand if fructose intake is indeed a reason for these ethnic differences.    ,NCT02533817
Healthy,Effects of Berry Peel Intake on Glucose Metabolism in Healthy Subjects, The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a 4-weeks intake of berry peel powder on fasting and postprandial glucose metabolism and inflammatory markers.

Healthy,Effect of Cashew Apple Juice on the Physiological and Psychological Fitness in the Middle Aged and Elderly Volunteers, Cashew or Anacardium occidentale L. is a plant in a family of Anacardiaceae. The fruit of cashew or cashew apple may be consumed fresh but contains high quantities of tannins yielding a bitter taste and dry mouth feel. Therefore it is more often prepared as beverage. It is rich in carbohydrate and vitamin C. It is also claimed for numerous ailments including antitumor antimicrobial urease inhibitory and lipoxygenase activity. In addition cashew apple juice also has excellent anti-oxidant potential. The preclinical data also demonstrated that cognitive deficit rats induced by cholinotoxin which received A.occidentale or cashew fruit juice for 2 weeks showed the neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing effects.Therefore the potential benefit of Cashew apple juice on physical fitness and psychological fitness of the middle aged and elderly is focused.    ,NCT02560077

Healthy,"Comparative Evaluation of the Effect on Blood Pressure of an Equivalent Content of Sodium in the Form of Bicarbonate of Sodium and in the Form of Sodium Chloride on ""Sensitive Sodium"" Subjects"," Many large-scale epidemiological studies have established a link between the average consumption of table salt (sodium chloride) and blood pressure. In France a survey conducted in 2001 showed that the average consumption of salt is 9 to 10g per people / day and health authorities considered it appropriate to reduce consumption about 20% by limiting contributions of sodium in prepared foods bread. In terms of basic and clinical research the biological effects of sodium chloride dietary intake have been the subject of numerous studies for several decades. This work showed that all subjects do not react uniformly to sodium chloride flows determining what the investigators call people ""sodium-sensitive"". For these people the sodium intake elevated blood pressure much more marked than in subjects called ""sodium-resistant."" ""Sodium-sensitive"" people represent 10 to 30% of the population. A marked over-representation of this phenotype was observed in patients with hypertension or a family history of hypertension. In addition studies conducted in animals and humans indicate that sodium intake has a different impact on biological parameters mentioned above as is done in the form of chloride salt or bicarbonate of sodium. Based on these factors investigators developed a clinical trial protocol intended to highlight a possible differential effect in the biological effects of the same sodium intake (2.56 g / day) orally depending on the nature salt.

Healthy,Can Correction of Low Vitamin D Status in Infancy Program for a Leaner Body Composition?, One in four infants are born with low amounts of vitamin D stored in their body. This study is designed to test whether improving vitamin D status quickly after birth helps infants to build muscle and to normalize growth. This is important since the investigators have noticed in previous work that infants with low vitamin D have higher body weight relative to body length later on and that those who develop very good stores quickly have a leaner body type. Therefore in this study infants with low stores early after birth will be given either the regular amount of supplementation or a higher amount to more rapidly build up the vitamin stores in the body. Infants in both groups will be measured for muscle and fat mass at standardized ages during the first year of life and into the toddler years. The information will inform health care professionals and parents of the importance of establishing good vitamin D stores early in life. Vitamin D supplementation is a modifiable factor that is already recommended for all term born infants. Knowing how much is needed in infants born with low stores has not been tested in a controlled manner in Canada.    ,NCT02563015
Healthy,Pre-calculated Doses of Medication for Pediatric Resuscitation a Simulation Experimental Trial, Dosage errors are common in the stressful situation of a pediatric resuscitation. In addition to that studies have reported that delays to provide medication is associated to worst survival rate for very sick children. To minimize delays and error the investigators recently published a resuscitation handbook who provides drug dosages for each weight for children thus eliminating the need for dosage calculation. Once the weight of the patient is known the physicians only have to open the book at the page corresponding to the weight and all the medications with their calculated dosage are provided. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the number of dosage error during simulated pediatric resuscitation comparing residents using the handbook vs. utilisation of a chart providing non-calculated dosage. This will be an experimental crossover trial among 40 residents performing four simulated case-scenarios in a high-fidelity simulation lab.    ,NCT02563912

Healthy,Human Fine-motor-skills in Weightlessness: Comparison of a Laboratory and an Everyday-like Context, The human performance during weightlessness was tested in a multiplicity of laboratory experiments during parabolic flights and in space. It is therefore known that human fine motor skills as grasping are affected by the impact of changing gravity levels. However because everyday life movements differ in several aspects from those done in an experimental lab situation investigators do not know until know if this kind of movements is altered in the same extend. Fine motor skills seem to depend on the context in which they are made. Thus the performance in weightlessness during everyday life could substantially differ from the results given by previous laboratory studies. This assumption will be tested in the present project with subjects executing one and the same grasping movement in two different contexts both in normal gravity conditions and in weightlessness. To that end the investigators developed a new method which allows comparing the same grasping movements under different conditions.    ,NCT02566213

Healthy,Health Beneficial Effects of Krill Oil and Lean and Fatty Fish, Intake of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from fish oil and fish are associated with significant health benefits in risk of cardiovascular disease. However both lean and fatty fish have been shown to have beneficial effects suggesting that not all effects are mediated by n-3 PUFAs. Krill oil is an n-3 PUFA supplement on the marked. The n-3 PUFAs from krill oil is in the form of phospholipids and these fatty acids may be more readily and effectively absorbed after ingestion than n-3 PUFAs in the form of triacylglycerols from fish oil. Fish also contain many other potential health components than n-3 PUFAs such as taurine and vitamin D iodine selenium and more unspecified components such as bioactive peptides which can mediate the health beneficial effects observed after intake of fish. The present study aims to elucidate the cardiovascular health beneficial effects after consumption of fish (lean and fatty) and krill oil with regard to effects on plasma lipids and other markers of cardiovascular health such as inflammatory haemostatic and endothelial dysfunction markers. The investigators will perform whole genome transcriptome analyses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in order to further understand the cardiovascular health benefits and elucidate the mechanisms of action.    ,NCT02568228

Healthy,Laser Speckle Flowgraphy in Caucasians: Age Dependence and Comparison With Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography, Some of the most prevalent eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are associated with ocular perfusion abnormalities. Currently there is no gold-standard method for the measurement of ocular blood flow available. Laser speckle flowgraphy is a promising technique for the two-dimensional assessment of ocular blood flow in humans. So far the technique has however been only gained widespread use in Japan. The experience in Caucasian subjects is very limited. In a Japanese population it was shown that mean blur rate a measure of chorioretinal blood velocity decreases with age. This is of relevance because an age-related decline in ocular blood flow may partially explain the age-dependence of ocular vascular disease. The present study investigates this age-dependence in healthy subjects. In addition the investigators investigate in a sub-group of this population whether relative flow volume (RFV) a novel index of blood flow in the human retina derived from laser speckle flowgraphy is associated with retinal blood flow as assessed with bi-directional Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography (DOCT).    ,NCT02582411
Healthy,Effect of Pharmacological Heart Rate Reduction on Visco-elastic Properties of the Arterial Wall (BRADYVASC), The conduit arteries exhibit a viscoelastic behavior. Visco-elasticity is partially regulated by endothelium and contributes to the optimization of the heart-vessel coupling. Aging or high resting heart rate (HR) could alter visco-elastic properties leading to increase stiffness of the conduit arteries an independent cardiovascular risk factor and degradation of heart-vessel coupling. Lowering HR with ivabradine could reduce these effects. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of HR reduction by repeated administration of ivabradine on visco-elastic properties vascular geometry and function of common carotid artery and on cardiovascular hemodynamic in healthy subject.

Healthy,Effects of Co-ingesting a Low/High GI Meal With Different Fat Saturation on Postprandial Glucose Insulin and Triacylglycerol Responses in Healthy Participants, It is now recognized that diet plays a critical role in the etiology and management of the chronic diseases such as diabetes obesity and cardiovascular disease. A high consumption of fat especially saturated fat is an established risk factor for Cardiovascular Disease.The glycaemic index (GI) is a measurement of the ability of different types of carbohydrate-based foods to raise blood glucose. The interest in low GI food as a weight management tool has been increasing. Different types of carbohydrates differ in their ability to increase postprandial blood glucose and insulin secretion and may also modulate the effect of different fatty acids. The current study will compare the consumption of low and high GI carbohydrate with different fat saturation on postprandial glucose insulin and triacylglycerol responses in healthy participants. The data generated will have direct applications in public health policy and clinical nutrition management of chronic disease. The outcomes of the study will significantly contribute to the long term national goals of Singapore to manage and to reduce the incidence of chronic disease associated with the metabolic syndrome.    ,NCT02585427

Healthy,Pedal Rate Influence on Oxygen Consumption in Eccentric, Nowadays ECC exercise can be realized using various modalities that target small or large muscle masses in a segmentary or dynamic way. The training program proposed in this study is realised on an handmade ergocycle which allows eccentric contractions. With this type of ergometer O2 consumption (VO2) is three to five fold lower than during an exercise realised at the same power output with a concentric ergocycle. Due to this later propertie which origins are not yet fully identified there is an increasing interest to embed ECC in rehabilitation programs. The investigators hypothesis that a higher pedal rate will induce a lower oxygen consumption with the same benefits.

Healthy,13C Trioctanoate Breath Test as a Measurement of Gastric Fat Volume Emptying, 13C breath tests represent an attractive alternative in the measurement of gastric emptying (GE). Therefore these tests have been used in a variety of clinical settings such as in the assessment of gastroparesis delayed GE in diabetic patients or in the assessment of GE with fat containing enteral formulas in critically ill patients. The investigators have previously demonstrated that the 13C sodium octanoate breath test (OBT) is an inappropriate measurement method for the GE of fat. The OBT appears to be affected by 1) post gastric processing of the OCC marker and 2) its interaction with the physical form and concentration of the fat present in the stomach and duodenum. The13C trioctanoate breath test (TriOBT) represents an attractive alternative to the OBT. Compared to OCC which is a medium chain fatty acid the 13C trioctanoate (TriOCC) is a triglyceride. TriOCC has similar physio chemical properties as the nutritional lipid e.g. rapeseed oil. This study aims to assess the efficacy of the TriOBT as a GE measurement method of fat in an acid stable lipid emulsion (LE1). The breath test results from the TriOBT will be compared with the OBT and further validated against gastric fat volume emptying data observed from MRI. The interim analysis will determine whether the study will proceed to stage 2 which will assess the efficacy of the TriOBT in an acid unstable lipid emulsion (LE4).    ,NCT02602158

Healthy,Hydrocolloids as Functional Food Ingredients for Gut Health, Seaweeds are a natural source of nutrients and dependent on the variety are rich in dietary fibre proteins essential vitamins and minerals. However this resource is highly underexploited. Countries such as Japan China North and South Korea are large consumers of edible seaweed while exposure in Western countries is much lower and mainly as industrially extracted seaweed derivatives a common additive in many food and healthcare products. Seaweeds have been associated with a number of human gut promoting health benefits such as decreasing faecal transit time through the gastrointestinal tract thus preventing constipation and resulting in a reduced exposure to harmful substances (decreasing colon cancer risk). These health benefits can be attributed to seaweeds high dietary fibre content. Interestingly the food and healthcare industry already utilize seaweed-extracted fibre in the manufacturing process thus steering the way forward towards the development of novel functional food products. These seaweed-extracted fibres are high molecular weight polysaccharides known as hydrocolloids and are non-digestible by humans hence classified as dietary fibre. Traditionally seaweed derived polysaccharides (hydrocolloids) have been used to provide thickening and gelling functionality to food stuffs and other industrial applications however there is emerging evidence to show that lower molecular weight polysaccharides and oligosaccharides derived from these hydrocolloids can also act as a source of soluble fibre and may have prebiotic activity. Recent developments in Japan and Korea have lead to the commercial availability of products containing low molecular weight seaweed derived fibre. There is also some evidence for the beneficial effects of seaweed derived fibre in other key health areas such as cardiovascular health cancer diabetes and obesity. However relatively little is known about the chemical physio-chemical and fermentation characteristics of seaweed fibre in the human gut. Some hydrocolloids notably guar gum (plant source) have also been employed for their health promoting properties in the areas of glucose tolerance and cholesterol lowering. However the use of hydrocolloids as functional food ingredients with health benefits for consumers has been rather limited and has focused more on uses in products for diabetics. It is particularly in the area of gut health that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) involved in hydrocolloid production and processing can enter the functional food ingredients market by using innovative processing technology. The total dietary fibre content of seaweed can be as high as 75% of the total dry weight and a high proportion of this is soluble. The fibre component essentially comprises the structural polysaccharides i.e. alginate and fucoidan in brown seaweeds carrageenan agar and porphyran in red seaweeds and ulvan in green seaweeds. As these fibres are primarily soluble they form viscous gels as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the fibre is fermented in the lower intestine but in general soluble and insoluble seaweed fibre tends to pass through the gut without being digested. In its natural form as part of the seaweed plant this fibre is typically high in molecular weight and passes through the gut too rapidly for the gut microflora to utilize it to any great extent. There is therefore a necessity to develop lower molecular weight forms that are more soluble and can be added at higher concentrations to food products without affecting the sensory properties of the product. The overall aim of the project is to realize an opportunity to produce low molecular weight polysaccharides (LMWP) from alginate- and agar-bearing seaweeds for applications in food & health. The two effective agar and alginate LMWPs identified by in vitro studies will be selected for assessment of prebiotic activity in a feeding trial in human volunteers (Ulster University) as part of an European Union (EU) study. The end points to be assessed will be stimulation of beneficial bacteria (bifidogenic effects) increased short chain fatty acid production beneficial effects on stool formation and improvements in gut barrier function. Additionally benefits of the LMWPs towards blood glucose levels (short term and acute) will be assessed.    ,NCT02608983

Healthy,The Effect of Blood Volume Changes on the Glucose Tolerance, In this study the investigators would like to elaborate on the mechanisms that lead to a higher insulin sensitivity after exercise training and a lower insulin sensitivity after bedrest. The investigators speculate that the concomitant chances in blood volume during training and bedrest might explain the changed insulin sensitivity because with a changing blood volume also the dilution space of the glucose will change. Furthermore the investigators would like to work on the influence of a changed capacity of skeletal muscle for glucose uptake and glycogen storage on the glucose sensitivity. Therefore A) a bed rest study with healthy untrained subjects and B) a training study with obese pre-diabetic patients will be conducted.    ,NCT02612597

Healthy,Primed vs Unprimed Facilitatory and Depressive Paired Associative Stimulation, Following brain injury (e.g. stroke) application of non-invasive brain stimulation may improve rehabilitative efforts. However the most effective method of non-invasive brain stimulation is unknown. Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a method of non-invasive brain stimulation that pairs an electrical peripheral nerve stimulus with a magnetic stimulus to the head. This method can be applied in a manner that increases (facilitates) or decreases (depresses) excitability within the brain. Furthermore applying two consecutive PAS sessions within minutes of each other (called primed PAS) may augment changes in excitability more than a single PAS session alone. Thus the purpose of this study is to compare the effect of a double PAS session (primed PAS) to the effect of a single PAS session (unprimed PAS) and a sham PAS session in healthy individuals.    ,NCT02619643

Healthy,Communicating Multiple Disease Risks, Epidemiology seeks to improve public health by identifying risk factors for cancer and other diseases and conveying that information to relevant audiences. The audience is presumed to understand and use that information to make appropriate decisions about lifestyle behaviors and medical treatments. Yet even though a single risk factor can affect the risk of multiple health outcomes this information is seldom communicated to people in a way that optimizes their understanding of the importance of engaging in a single healthy behavior. Providing individuals with the ability to understand how a single behavior (obtaining sufficient physical activity) could affect their risk of developing multiple diseases could foster a more coherent and meaningful picture of the behavior's importance in reducing health risks increase motivation and intentions to engage in the behavior and over time improve public health. The proposed study translates epidemiological data about five diseases that cause significant morbidity and mortality (i.e. colon cancer breast cancer (women) heart disease diabetes and stroke) into a visual display that conveys individualized risk estimates in a comprehensible meaningful and useful way to diverse lay audiences.    ,NCT02621671

Healthy,Study of the Impact of Cheese Matrix on Postprandial Lipemia: a Clinical Study, Dairy products consumption is widely recommended in a healthy diet not only for bone growth and maintenance but also as a protein calcium and magnesium sources for an adequate diet. However dairy products are a major dietary source of saturated fat that is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. ln this context dietary guidelines still advocate a restriction in dietary saturated fat for optimal heart health. Nevertheless the association between saturated fat and the risk of heart disease remains highly controversial within the scientific community. There is also emerging evidence that the impact of dietary saturated fat will be significantly influenced by the food matrix through which it is provided. Recent studies indicate that cheese could have a major influence on intestinal fat absorption and the magnitude of the after meal release of fat in blood circulation. This is of interest because substantial evidence exists indicating that elevated levels of the after meal fat levels are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Therefore the improvement of the after meal fat levels produced by cheese consumption could well be part of novel therapeutic approaches contributing to improve cardiovascular risk. The general objective of the proposed research is to investigate how cheese consumption affects the after meal release of fat in blood circulation in healthy subjects. Our hypothesis is that compared to butter cheese consumption will have a beneficial impact on the after meal fat levels in healthy subjects. Favourable results from the proposed study will provide novel and much warranted evidence on the importance of considering changes in the after meal fat levels not only bad cholesterol as part of the on-going saturated fat-heart disease debate and that cheese should indeed be part of a healthy diet.    ,NCT02623790

Healthy,Glycemic Index of Instant Noodle With and Without Soup: Does Serving Method Have an Effect?, Glycemic index is commonly used as a method to determine the effect of a food to blood glucose. Despite its carbohydrate and fat content instant noodle is very popular in Asia including Indonesia. Based on the serving method there are instant noodle without and with soup. Studies have shown that water content of a meal may influence glycemic response of the meal and thus have an effect on the result of GI measurement. However none specifically studied instant noodles nor the additional water content as soup (not incorporated in the food matrix). Therefore this study aims to determine whether the serving method of instant noodle (with and without soup) may influence the glycemic response and glycemic index value of the meal.    ,NCT02625350
Healthy,Water Intake and Glycemic Response : Preliminary Study, Glycemic index concept is widely used to determine impact of a food to blood glucose. Several studies showed that water content and intake after meal may influence glycemic response of the meal and thus have an effect on the result of GI measurement. Currently these studies found conflicting results. Therefore this study aims to determine whether water intake specifically after meal may influence the glycemic response and glycemic index value of the meal.    ,NCT02625363

Healthy,Measurements of Corneal Biomechanical Properties Using a Dynamic Scheimpflug Analyzer for Normal Adults in South Korea, The human cornea is affected by the magnitude and velocity of both internal and external forces because the cornea has both static and dynamic resistance components. Considering these natures of the human cornea many investigators have tried to demonstrate corneal biomechanical properties to understand these characteristics of the cornea. Corneal biomechanical properties are known to influence the accuracy of measurements in intraocular pressure (IOP) and are recognized as important factor to explain the susceptibility of development of glaucomatous damage. Until recently the only instrument which enabled the in vivo measurements of the ocular biomechanical properties was ocular response analyzer (ORA Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments Depew NY USA).8 The ORA has been used to assess the biomechanical properties of the cornea according to the dynamic bidirectional applanation process. A dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer (corneal visualization Scheimpflug technology [Corvis ST] OCULUS Wetzlar Germany) has been introduced recently and has become a useful instrument for evaluating corneal biomechanical properties. The dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer captures the dynamic process of corneal deformation caused by an air puff using an ultra-high-speed Scheimpflug camera at a rate of up to 4330 images per second. Until now well-organized analysis on the normative data of the corneal biomechanical profiles measured with the dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer has not been reported yet. Hence in the present study we aim to conduct normative data analysis for the corneal biomechanical properties with the dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer in South Korea.    ,NCT02627170
Healthy,Impact of Training Status on Bioavailability of Flavanones, Flavonoids are compounds that have been proven to have a beneficial effect on health such as reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and in some cases cancer.

Healthy,Assessment of Millet Oat and Rye Porridge Breakfasts Glucose and Gastric Emptying, Breakfast porridges are made from milled grains and are commonly eaten worldwide. Traditionally different grains are used in different countries. For example oats are more common in the Anglo-Saxon countries; rye is favoured in the Scandinavian countries whilst millet is very common in parts of India and Africa. However the nutritional value and potential metabolic and health effects may vary dramatically between different grains. For example what is the effect of the different grains on blood sugar or on how fast the stomach empties after eating the porridge and how full people feel. All these physiological responses may differ between these grains resulting in potential health benefits. RESEARCH QUESTION: The investigators hypothesise that porridges made from different grains will behave differently during the digestion and cause differences in blood glucose levels gastric emptying and appetite. This study which is a 4-way randomized cross over pilot study in healthy participants aims to answer this research question. The participants will be asked to eat a porridge breakfasts made with oats rye and millet of different varieties (but containing the same amount of calories) in 4 morning studies one week apart.

Healthy,Substrate Metabolism Growth Hormone Signaling (GH) and Insulin Sensitivity During GH and Ketone Bodies Infusion, Background: Humans naturally produce ketone bodies under daily living conditions. The main ketone bodies are two functioning acids beta-hydroxybutyric acid (3-OHB) and acetoacetate and the pH-neutral but odorous acetone. In the fed state level of 3-OHB is suppressed to an almost unmeasurable level while in the fasted state it rises to 0.1-0.5 millimoles (mM). Main regulation of ketone synthesis is the abundance of sugars and resulting adaptations in insulin secretion. Thus ketone bodies are formed when sugar is not readily available and insulin is suppressed. This picture is to a certain degree seen in acute inflammatory states and indeed during starvation where level of 3-OHB increases to 5-8 mM. Hypothesis:   1. Ketone bodies changes the insulin sensitivity and substrate metabolism in human subjects   2. Ketone bodies changes the GH signaling in muscle and adipose tissue Aim: The investigators wish to provide knowledge on changes in metabolites and shift in signaling pathways and insulin sensitivity during GH infusion and concomitant ketone bodies infusion among healthy subjects.    ,NCT02655263

Healthy,Safety and Efficacy of Two Tetanus-Diphtheria Vaccines for a Donor Hyper Immunization Program, Many plasma donation centers have Tetanus immunization programs that are implemented in order to collect plasma with high levels of tetanus antibodies. The immunization program requires participants to receive multiple tetanus vaccinations over a period of time with the goal of hyper-immunizing them to tetanus. Their antibody-rich plasma is then used to manufacture a tetanus immunoglobulin product which helps with the prophylaxis and treatment of tetanus disease. The Tetanus vaccine previously used for these programs is no longer being manufactured. Therefore we must evaluate the safety and efficacy of a different vaccine when used for this purpose. The only other FDA approved Tetanus vaccines currently available for adults in the US are combination vaccines that also immunize against Diphtheria and/or Pertussis. In this study the investigators will evaluate two vaccines that are combinations of Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td). Investigators will not evaluate any vaccines containing Pertussis antigen. The vaccines to be evaluated are manufactured by MassBiologics and Sanofi Pasteur (Tenivac). The package insert for these vaccines indicates they should be administered to previously vaccinated people once every 10 years. However this study will evaluate whether they are safe and effective for dosing every 90 days. The investigators hypothesize that at least 25% of study subjects will have a positive response to at least one of the five planned doses. Each vaccine will be evaluated separately.    ,NCT02673255

HEALTHY,Biological Aging of Skeletal Muscles in Humans, Aging affects almost all the tissues and physiological functions and skeletal muscle is the most affected organ. The progressive decline of the weight and the muscular function linked to the aging contributes to the lack of autonomy and dependence but also to an increase of the mortality risks. Sarcopenia is also a prevalent condition because it is detected in 13-24% of 60 years old and 50% of 80 years old and more. However strong inter-individual variations of this prevalence of sarcopenia exists. The key issue is to understand why the biological aging of the skeletal muscle is so different between people. In this study mechanisms involved in biological aging of the skeletal muscle in aging people (same chronological age) will be specified.    ,NCT02675192

Healthy,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Human Supraclavicular Brown Adipose Tissue - MIBAT Study, Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is unique in its capability to convert chemical energy directly into heat. Active BAT increases energy expenditure and can thereby counteract obesity and insulin resistance. Currently the imaging method of choice to assess BAT morphology and function is 18F-FDG-PET/CT which is expensive and exposes patients or healthy volunteers to ionizing radiation thus impeding larger prospective studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could constitute a suitable alternative and preliminary small-scale studies are promising. The overall aim of this research proposal is to develop reliable magnetic resonance imaging techniques to facilitate the study of brown adipose tissue in human adults specifically in the context of endocrine disease. Specifically investigators want to   1. Develop a reliable MR imaging protocol for human BAT and compare BAT volume to cold induced nonshivering thermogenesis as a measure of BAT activity.   2. Assess the intra-individual variance of BAT volume measured by MRI.   3. Evaluate direct measurement of BAT temperature by functional MRI.    ,NCT02682706

Healthy,DPP4 Inhibition & Beta Cell Function, This study is being done to determine the role of a hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) on insulin secretion and to study how GLP-1 works in in diabetic individuals as compared to non-diabetic individuals under fasting conditions. GLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone made in the intestines. It is released into the circulating blood after eating and helps to control the blood glucose levels by increasing insulin secretion by cells in the pancreas. However the exact method by which GLP-1 causes insulin secretion and how GLP-1 activity is changed in diabetic persons remain unclear. This research is being done to address these questions and better understand the function of GLP-1. In this research the investigators will use a synthetic form of Exendin-9 to determine the effects of GLP-1 on insulin secretion in diabetic and non-diabetic persons. Exendin-9 acts as a blocker of GLP-1 action allowing us to study the specific effects of the GLP-1 hormone. Exendin-9 is an investigational compound which means it is still being tested in research studies and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In this study the investigators will also use the drug Sitagliptin which is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study use of Sitagliptin is considered investigational since it is not being used for treatment of diabetes but is instead being used to understand how GLP-1 works and to better understand how medications like Sitagliptin work in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.    ,NCT02683187

Healthy,Tongue Motor Recruitment During Exercise, The prevalence of dysphagia may be as high as 22% in individuals over 50 years of age. There are few therapeutic options offered to these individuals. One more recent therapeutic option is Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) which has been used successfully to maintain or increase expiratory force generating pressures cough function and swallowing in a number of disease populations. Recently the investigators have noted improvements in oral transit time during swallowing in individuals with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) that could potentially be attributed to improved base of tongue functioning and muscle activation. There has been one study that demonstrated that breathing training resulted in increased and prolonged submental (under the chin) muscle activation as evidenced by surface electromyography. However no studies have investigated the activation of the tongue muscles during various swallowing and breathing exercises. A small needle electrode (fine wire EMG) is standard of care in diagnosing muscular diseases because it can determine amount of muscle recruitment for muscles throughout the body. This aim of this research study is to examine the effects of breathing exercises and swallowing exercises on tongue muscle activity in healthy adults.    ,NCT02687737

Healthy,Effect of Vitamin E on Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, One-third of the US population has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) due to obesity and ~8 million of these individuals have a progressive form of the disease non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently there are no noninvasive ways to determine which individuals with NAFLD will develop NASH. This is of medical importance since NASH can be a prelude to the development of end-stage liver disease. The study of NAFLD has been limited by several factors including the difficulties associated with studying liver metabolism in vivo in humans. Our group has pioneered new methods that use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to measure intermediary hepatic metabolism in humans with a goal of directly studying the pathophysiology of bland steatosis and NASH. In this study these noninvasive methods will be used to characterize and compare the metabolic alterations that accompany bland steatosis and NASH and test the hypothesis that detects if hepatic mitochondrial metabolism contribute to both disorders. Such characterization is fundamental to establishing a rational approach to the prevention and treatment of NAFLD and may provide simple non-invasive methods to differentiate benign and progressive forms of NAFLD. This proposal will be addressed via separate isotopic studies occurring at different time points during a prolonged fast. In subjects with NAFLD these studies will be carried out before and after treatment with Vitamin E or placebo. Healthy subjects will participate in initial baseline studies only without Vitamin E or placebo intervention. The study is designed to harness the physiologic changes that occur with short- and long-term fasting to provide a rapid and cost-effective method to accomplish the aims of the application.    ,NCT02690792

Healthy,Accuracy of Commercially Available Heart Rate Monitors, Over the last two decades there has been a proliferation of commercially available heart rate monitors. Recognizing that elite athletes often use heart rate to monitor training and assess aerobic fitness fitness companies have offered a variety of heart rate monitoring systems to the general public. Recently there has been a move from monitors that rely on chest straps to measure electrical activity toward more convenient wrist-worn monitors that employ optical sensing technology similar to that used for pulse oximetry. While the accuracy of chest strap monitors has been assessed in a variety of studies there is no data concerning the accuracy of wrist-worn heart rate monitors. Assessment of the monitors' accuracy is important both for the subjects who rely upon these monitors to guide their athletic activity and for the physicians to whom these individuals report their heart rate readings.    ,NCT02697214

Healthy,Assessment of Dietary Biomarkers and Metabolic Effects After the Intake of Milk and Cheese," Dietary biomarkers are compounds in biofluids that directly reflect the intake of specific foods or food groups. Their exploration and use in the field of dietary assessments could provide an objective measure of actual intake complementing classical assessment methods (e.g. food frequency questionnaire 24h recalls). To date only a limited number of foods have been covered by validated biomarkers. The study is part of the international project ""The Food Biomarker Alliance (FOODBALL)"". The study described here has been assigned to assess biomarkers of the intake of milk and cheese. Up to now there is an evident lack of data on specific and validated biomarkers of milk and cheese (dairy products) which belong to the most relevant public health related foods in Europe. This study will further provide novel insights into the influence of fermentation of milk-based foods on metabolic effects and postprandial adaptations which has not yet been studied in depth before using cheese as fermented product. Outcomes will support and expand earlier findings on correlation between the intake of fermented dairy products intake and human health.    ",NCT02705560

Healthy,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Motility in Crohn's 1, Crohn's disease (CD) is becoming more common. One of the main features of this disease is weight loss and malnutrition with symptoms such as tummy aches and bloating. These problems have a strong negative effect on the patients' quality of life but the causes of these problems are not well understood. Enteroendocrine cells are nutrient sensors in the bowel that secrete special chemicals (called hormones) that control appetite and the movements all the gut. The investigators think that this control mechanism goes wrong in Crohn's patients and they have set off to do more research on this. Looking at the inside work of the gut has always been difficult and at times unpleasant for patients however recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are allowing the investigators to study the workings of the gut in greater detail and without discomfort for the patients. Before studying the Crohn's patients it is necessary to run a set of pilot experiments in healthy volunteers using a test meal and subsequent MRI imaging to look at the motion of the gut. This validation stage of the methodology is essential before embarking in more detailed studies in the patients.    ,NCT02717117

Healthy,Effects of Cocoa Procyanidins on Vascular Function, There is a question regarding the role of higher flavanol oligomers (procyanidins) and of intestinal flavanol metabolites i.e. valerolactones in the context of flavanol intake-related vascular effects. Only flavanol monomers and to a certain degree dimers are absorbed in the small intestine and enter circulation. Higher oligomers (procyanidins) are not absorbed and are catabolized by the colonic microflora. The catabolites enter the circulation. Phenolic acids and valerolactones represent a significant proportion of these catabolites reaching peak concentrations in the order of 6-10 h post ingestion. The vascular effects of these colonic microbiome-derived flavanol derivatives have not been studied so far. The purpose of the study is to determine the timecourse of endothelial function along with flavanol catabolites & metabolites during acute sustained and acute on sustained ingestion of procyanidins as compared to previously used flavanol interventions and flavanol free control.    ,NCT02728466

Healthy,Effects of Acute Red Raspberry Consumption on Vascular Function in Healthy Individuals, Accumulating evidence from epidemiological and human intervention studies indicates that the cardiovascular health benefits of diets rich in fruits and vegetables are (in part) related to their (poly)phenol content. Raspberries are rich in phenolic and polyphenolic compounds in particular procyanidins ellagitannins and anthocyanins but also phenolic acids. At present a small number of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of berry (poly)phenols on validated surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease risk have shown promising results. However to date very few human studies have specifically investigated the effects of raspberry (poly)phenols on cardiovascular function in healthy subjects. Moreover ellagitannin-derived metabolites are believed to persist for a long period of time in the blood and urine. Therefore the investigators will investigate the presence of plasma and urinary raspberry-derived metabolites 24h post-consumption. To the investigators knowledge the effects of red raspberry consumption on vascular function in humans have not been investigated before. This information is necessary for the planning of long-term studies aiming to assess the potential beneficial effects of raspberries. Therefore this study aims to investigate the potential role of red raspberry (poly)phenols in the modulation of vascular function by monitoring changes in vascular function together with the major (poly)phenol derivatives/metabolites in plasma.    ,NCT02734901

Healthy,Human Genomic Population Structure and Phenotype-genotype Variation in ADME Genes in Five Populations," Physicians know that their patients can react differently to the same medical treatment: for some of them the drug will prove inefficient whereas for others it might provoke side-effects sometimes rather serious. Such differences in response to drug intake are due to several factors of which molecular variations in specific genes named "" ADME "" (Absorption Distribution Metabolism Excretion). This project aims at investigating the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the diversity of ADME genes in human populations. Because of their role at the interface between the organism and its chemical environment ADME genes are likely targets of recent selective pressures linked to changes in the environments in which humans evolved such as changes in dietary habits for instance. The aim of this project is to study the diversity of ADME genes and of their expression in five populations located along a latitudinal axis that extends from East Africa to Central Europe passing through the Arabian Peninsula and the Mediterranean area so as to take into account environmental factors that might have influenced the evolution of this diversity. This project is thus intended to evidence the evolutionary mechanisms that shaped genomic regions that are functionally important from the clinical and epidemiological point of view. Moreover it will allow us to extend the knowledge of human molecular diversity and its evolution to a key-region of the peopling history of our species.    ",NCT02789527

Healthy,Multi-country Study- Effect of Dietary Fats on Fat Deposition," There is existing evidence to show that vegetable oils having unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position with predominantly palmitic acid (C16:0) or stearic acid (C18:0) in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions of fat molecules do not raise serum cholesterol levels. These observations have come to be known as or explained by the ""sn-2 hypothesis"". New evidence have also emerged to show that saturated fatty acids (C16:0 C18:0) in the sn-1 and -3 positions reduces fat deposition in a rat model. Therefore further studies in humans are warranted to confirm these earlier findings. Fats and oils are made up of >90% triacylglycerol (TAG)- fat molecules which consist of a glycerol backbone to which 3 esterified fatty acids are attached. The positions of fatty acid attachment are referred to by stereospecific numbers sn -1 -2 and -3. Early evidence shown that the unique stereospecificity of fatty acid distribution on the palm fat molecule conferred health benefits in that it inhibited experimental atherosclerosis in the rabbit model. In vegetable oils oleic acid [a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)] is predominantly situated at the sn-2 position while in animals fats it is predominantly palmitic acid or stearic acid (C16:0 or C18:0-saturated fat) that is situated there. Even though palm olein and lard have similar proportions of saturated fatty acid (SFA) MUFA and polyunsatuared fatty acid (PUFA) they differ significantly in their positional distribution on the TAG molecule. Palm olein TAG contains only 7-11 % palmitic acid at the sn-2 position while about 87% is unsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid and linoleic acid). Lard has the highest amount of palmitic acid in the sn-2 position at 70%. On the other hand in human milk palmitic acid is predominantly in sn-2 (53-57 %) while cow milk fat contains less palmitic acid (38 %) there. It is now believed that the distribution of fatty acids in the TAG is more important than the fatty acid composition alone in conferring the oils' 'saturated' or 'unsaturated' properties. In this proposed study the effects on the outcome measures investigated of different fatty acids (palmitic acid oleic acid linoleic acid) at the sn-1 sn-2 and sn-3 positions of the TAG molecule in three different test fats will be investigated.

Healthy,Effects of Vitamin D3 Supplementation on Cognitive Function in Community Dwelling Older Adults, Ireland is predicted to have the highest older adult population growth of any European Union country. A substantial economic and social challenge of this projected growth is the increased incidence of cognitive impairment and the likelihood of progression to dementia. Dementia's such as Alzheimer's disease typically have a long prodromal stage with brain changes identifiable from the earliest stages of neuropathology providing an opportunity for intervention. Switching to a strategy of earlier identification and prevention would significantly reduce prevalence and the associated cost. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the use of vitamin D supplements in community dwelling older adults as a lifestyle approach that may support cognitive and physical functioning. The research will incorporate several stages including an initial in-depth screening process a novel and sensitive cognitive battery 6 month double blind placebo controlled intervention of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and a concluding participant feedback interview. These results will be used to assess the feasibility of recruiting and assessing community dwelling older adults for extensive nutrition related cognitive studies.    ,NCT02804841

Healthy,White Adipose Tissue Clocks and High Calorie Feeding, Peripheral tissues (e.g. liver adipose muscle) express self-sustained circadian clocks that coordinate daily metabolic rhythms. The timing of clock rhythms in peripheral tissues is highly sensitive to feeding-fasting signals across the sleep-wake transition. Nutritional insults such as high fat overfeeding (HF-OF) have been shown to attenuate clock gene expression in peripheral tissues resulting in a deleterious re-programming of the circadian metabolome. Studies in humans have only superficially investigated how the circadian clock machinery is impacted by nutritional signals. The overall goal of this pilot project is to take the first steps toward developing translational methods to investigate links between changes in energy flux and the circadian system in human tissues. Using an innovative ex vivo cell culture approach the investigators will examine the impact of 3-days of HF-OF compared to eucaloric (EU) feeding on the expression of core clock genes in human subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). The Investigators hypothesize that compared to EU the amplitude of clock gene expression in SAT measured over 24hrs will be attenuated following short-term HF-OF. This pilot project will serve as a launch point for designing future studies into the effects of diet and exercise on the circadian control of metabolism in adipose tissue depots as well as other tissues (e.g. muscle).    ,NCT02809482

Healthy,Study of Supplement's Antioxidant Properties That Contains Natural Extracts, While it is well accepted that a low level of RONS production is necessary to maintain physiological function too much formation of RONS are believed to participate in biomolecules damage. Damage of lipids proteins and DNA/RNA to cellular and tissue level as a consequence of oxidative stress has been linked to a number of serious diseases including cancer cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as hypertension and atherosclerosis neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's dementias diabetes and the process of aging. The dietary intake of antioxidants is thought to play a major role in oxidative stress network. Many epidemiologic studies have reported an inverse association between vegetable and fruit consumption with reduced risk of chronic diseases especially cancer and CVDs. However although many clinical trials have been conducted with vitamins (E C or their combinations) their in vivo protective effect remains uncertain. Therefore the possibility that the complex mixture of phytochemicals in foods may contribute to their protecting effects has been raised. In this concept it is possible multiple compounds to act through complimentary or synergistic mechanisms to present a greater biologic effect than can be achieved by any individual component To investigate this hypothesis a double-blind randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in order to investigate the effects of a multi-micronutrient supplement against oxidative stress in apparently healthy adults.    ,NCT02837107

Before participants go into the heat tent they will provide a urine sample (for baseline hydration status as indicated by urine osmolality) a blood sample (for glucose insulin arginine vasopressin/copeptin ghrelin and serum osmolality and plasma volume) and have a peripheral quantitative computer tomography scan of their thigh to indicate muscle size. On the day proceeding the heat tent participants will have these measures repeated along with metabolic rate before consuming a 75 g glucose drink followed by 15 minutely blood samples and hourly metabolic rate measures for 120 minutes (i.e. an oral glucose tolerance test; OGTT). Following this participants will be presented with a large bowl of pasta and sauce and will be instructed to eat until satisfied (maximum 30 min). Blood samples will be taken every 10 minutes for 60 minutes following the meal. Participants also have the option to opt-in to have a muscle biopsy taken. This will be taken before and ~120 minutes after the glucose drink.    ,NCT02841449

Healthy,Systemic Inflammatory Response to CCRE, Purpose: The purpose of this study is to classify volunteers as endotoxin-responders or non-responders following inhalation of 20000 EU Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin (CCRE). Endotoxin is a commonly encountered bioaerosol and component of indoor and outdoor air pollution. For reasons that remain unclear some individuals appear to be more susceptible to the inflammatory effects of inhaled endotoxin than are others possibly owing to single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene that influence TLR4 signaling and function. These susceptible individuals represent a population of particular interest for further mechanistic studies of the effects of endotoxin and for therapeutic trials. Susceptibility to inhaled endotoxin will be determined by measuring change in peripheral blood neutrophil counts a biomarker of systemic inflammation following inhaled CCRE. In our previous work the investigators have found that inhalation of 20000 EU CCRE is well tolerated and induces measurable increase in neutrophil content of peripheral blood in susceptible individuals. Our hope is that this CCRE inhalation protocol can be employed to screen large populations for susceptibility to the inflammatory effect of inhaled endotoxin.    ,NCT02847247

Healthy,Study of AC0058TA in Healthy Male and Female Subjects, AC0058TA is a small molecule compound that potently selectively and irreversibly inhibits Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) phosphorylation and downstream signals resulting in inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production in monocytes and inhibition of lymphocyte activation (predominantly B-cell activation) in the preclinical studies. The nonclinical program has demonstrated that AC0058TA has the potential to interfere with signaling functions mediated by tyrosine kinases and may be useful for controlling excessive or aberrant T- and B-cell activation in autoimmune diseases. As an investigational targeted therapy for RA and SLE AC0058TA is expected to address the unmet need of this patient population for whom there are currently no effected therapies and there is a great unmet medical need AC0058TA may inhibit the key pathway which involves the disease process.    ,NCT02847325

Healthy,Plyometric Training for Elderly Women, Introduction: the physiological aging process induces several structural changes in the musculoskeletal system. These in turn result in functional changes that are reflected in the senescent dependency determining the reduction in their quality of life. Power training has been identified as ideal to mitigate the effects of aging. However there are indications that an intervention based on the potentiation of the stretch-shortening cycle action is a better choice.    ,NCT02852642
Healthy,Power Training Versus Strength Training in the Elderly, The inexorable decline in motor skills during aging provides the investigators with an elderly population with various functional limitations. Among these the ability to walk being associated with the risk of falling has been studied by several authors. The adoption of strength and power training as an intervention strategy to reduce the negative effects arising from the physiological or pathological process of aging has been widely discussed in these studies. However the effects of these interventions on biomechanical gait indicators have not been fully debated yet. Therefore this study aimed to compare the effects of these two training protocols on functional capacities and biomechanical gait parameters of elderly women.    ,NCT02852668

Healthy,Protein Requirements for Active Adolescent Males (IAAO-AM), Protein requirements in active individuals have been suggested to be greater than the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA). Nutritional requirements for dietary amino acids in adolescents have traditionally been determined utilizing the nitrogen balance technique which is prone to underestimating protein requirements. As a result there is a need to re-evaluate recommendations in order to characterize how dietary amino acid needs may be modulated by physical activity. Recent studies using the minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique have suggested that protein requirements in young men are at least 50% higher than the RDA based on nitrogen balance data. The purpose of this study is to measure the protein requirement in adolescent males using the IAAO technique in the presence of a variable intensity exercise stimulus.    ,NCT02859181

Healthy,To Determine the Metabolomics and Microbiome Changes After Cranberry Juice Consumption Among Young Women, The compliance of participants in cranberry related clinical trial is poor due to the bitterness and astringency of cranberry products. There is a pressing need for an effective approach to verify participant compliance. The PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) /OPLS-DA (Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) models established from the investigator's previous study provide an opportunity to identify cranberry juice consumers. In this blinded placebo-controlled cross-over study investigators hypothesize that the established statistical models of PLS-DA (Partial least squares discriminant analysis) /OPLS-DA (Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis) can identify cranberry juice consumers and non-consumers by analyzing the metabolomic changes in blood and urine among young women. In order to further explore the function of cranberry microbiome profile will also be compared between cranberry juice consumption and placebo consumption after long-term treatment. Another comparison of metabolomic changes between short-term treatment and long-term treatment will be made to further identify candidate biomarkers of cranberry consumption and explore the correlation between acute effects and chronic effects of cranberry.    ,NCT02860468

Healthy,Effect of Inspiratory Muscle Training on Recreational Cyclists, Introduction: The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has showed great benefits to the respiratory autonomic system and mainly to the improvement of physical performance in healthy subjects. The latter is related to the improvement of respiratory muscle strength decreased of dyspnoea peripheral fatigue and delay in activation of muscle metaboreflex during exercise. However there is no consensus about the best training load to IMT because the prescription has been done only using percentage of the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and 60% of MIP has been the most used. Therefore the IMT prescription protocol that takes into account the respiratory muscle strength and endurance can provide additional benefits to protocols commonly applied once that respiratory muscle differs from the other muscles due to its greater muscle endurance. In the sense the IMT using inspiratory critical pressure (PThC) comes up with an alternative since the PThC calculation considers these characteristics. Objective:To evaluate the effect of the IMT using PThC on cardiovascular respiratory metabolic and autonomic responses in recreational cyclists and compare it to a IMT using 60% of MIP. Methods: Thirty men recreational cyclists (20-40 years) will be randomized to placebo group (PG n = 10) PThC group (PTHCG n = 10) and 60% of MIP group (60G n = 10) taking into account the age and functional aerobic capacity. All subjects will perform the following evaluations: cardiovascular autonomic tests [heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) at rest and after active postural change] pulmonary function testing respiratory muscle strength (RMS) test cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) incremental respiratory muscle endurance test (iRME) [maximum respiratory pressure sustained for 1 minute (PThMAX)] and constant respiratory loads test (95% 100% and 105% of PThMAX) both using an linear inspiratory load resistor (PowerBreathe K5). The PThC will be obtained from the linear regression using the time(TLIM) of and load of each constant test (95% 100% and 105% PThMAX). During evaluations the ECG (BioAmp FE132) blood pressure (BP) using Finometer Pro (Finapress Medical Systems) and respiration (Marazza) signals will be acquired. The signals will be coupled by data acquisition and analysis device (Power Lab 8/35) and sampled at 1000 Hz. Moreover the oxyhemoglobin deoxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin responses will be measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (Oxymon MKIII) sampled at 250Hz. The IMT will be performed for 11 weeks (3 times/week 1-hour duration). The session will consist of 5-min warm-up (50% of the training load) and 3 sets of 15 minutes (breathing against 100% of the training load) with 1-min interval between them. Heart rate and BP will be monitored in all training sessions. The RMS iRME respiratory constant load tests and CPET will be performed before and after the training and in the 3rd and 7th week (for training load adjustment). The pulmonary function testing and the cardiovascular autonomic tests will be performed only before and after training. The data will be analyzed by specific statistical tests (parametric and nonparametric) according to the data distribution and their respective variances. Significance will be set at p<0.05. Expected results: It is expected that the training performed by PTHCG when compared to training performed by 60G and PG promotes: greater improvementin workload (Watts) and peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak); increasing in MIP and iRME; decreasing of dyspnoea and peripheral fatigue; delay in activation of muscle metaboreflex in the CPET and iRME; improvement incardiac parasympathetic autonomic modulation and reducing cardiac and peripheral sympathetic modulation. Moreover it is expected that the results can provide information for a better understanding of the responses obtained by the PThC training in the different evaluated systems. In addition these results will allow the use of this method by health professionals as a new assessment tool and IMT prescription.    ,NCT02984189

Healthy,Effect of Prebiotic Intake on Gut Microbiota in Healthy Adults, In recent years the importance of the gut microbiota to human health has been demonstrated. In adulthood the microbial profile is relatively stable yet can be transiently altered by factors such as diet or antibiotic treatment. Such changes may be beneficial as gut microbiota has been shown to differ in normal versus disease states including inflammatory bowel disease obesity type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. Given this relationship there is intense interest in designing interventions that positively influence the gut microbial profile. Prebiotics are non-digestible fermentable oligo- and polysaccharides that alter the colonic environment in favour of health-promoting bacterial species such as bifidobacteria which selectively ferment prebiotics. Given the ability of prebiotics to beneficially alter the microbial profile there is a need to identify the dosing requirements to positively modulate the gut microbiota. This study will test the effect of two doses of prebiotic on gut microbiota taxonomy and diversity.    ,NCT03042494

Healthy,Impact of Genetic Polymorphism on Drug-Drug Interactions Involving CYP2D6, CYP2D6 is characterized by a huge variability in the general population mainly because of genetic polymorphism and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). CYP2D6 genotype is known to have an impact on the extent of DDIs. Indeed several studies have pointed out differential DDIs extent according to CYP2D6 genotype. The terms phenoconversion and phenotype switch are both used to describe the phenomenon by which a given subject changes his phenotype to another due external influence such as DDIs. When given a sufficiently strong CYP2D6 inhibitor the phenotype of an individual with no mutant allele (extensive metabolizer EM) of CYP2D6 can be modified to a poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype. This vulnerability is also thought to be dependent on CYP2D6 genotype. Various combinations of alleles predict an EM genotype which represents about 60 to 70% of the general population. The aim of the study is to determine whether the presence of genetic mutation in CYP2D6 has an impact on DDIs involving the CYP2D6 enzyme. Our interest focuses on CYP2D6 EM carriers of two fully functional alleles and carriers of one non-functional and one functional allele. In order to elucidate this question CYP2D6 activity will be measured on healthy volunteers by administration of single low doses of dextromethorphan and tramadol in presence or not of duloxetine and paroxetine two known CYP2D6 inhibitors.    ,NCT03054220
Healthy,Anorectal Function and Neuronal-glial-epithelial Unit in Healthy Subjects, This study aims to assess the phenotype of the enteric nervous system (enteric neurons) in healthy subjects. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is composed by enteric neurons and enteric glial cells. There is a cross-talk between ENS and the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB). ENS and IEB together constitute the neuronal-glial-epithelial unit. This unit has a key role in gut functions. The characteristics and the phenotype of the ENS also change according to age and environmental factors. Similar study is ongoing for patients with Spina Bifida. Anorectal data and phenotype of the neuronal-glial-epithelial unit in healthy subjects is required to assess abnormality of these items in patients with neurological disease including Spina Bifida.    ,NCT03054415

Healthy,Neurophysiological Impact of a Fronto-temporal tDCS Stimulation in Healthy Subjects: a Multimodal Imaging Approach," tDCS is a technique emerging as a prospective therapy for neurologic psychiatric and addictive disorders. Specifically fronto-temporal tDCS with anodal stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathodal stimulation over the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) has been reported to reduce treatment-resistant auditory hallucinations (AH) negative symptoms and insight of the illness in schizophrenia. However despite an increasing use in clinical settings tDCS suffers from limitations especially regarding the strength and the duration of therapeutic effects. Some imaging reports suggest that tDCS effects are not restricted to the brain areas located under the electrodes but spread through distributed cortical networks functionally connected with the targets and reach subcortical areas. Overall these studies suggest that tDCS modulates functional connectivity within and across resting-state networks and brain activity. However these effects are currently described at different levels depending on the imaging technique used. Moreover the majority of studies have focused on motor cortex stimulation while the specific effects of fronto-temporal tDCS are scarce. Finally effects of the stimulation applied online are rarely inspected. According to the therapeutic effects of fronto-temporal tDCS on schizophrenia and the dopaminergic pathophysiological hypothesis of schizophrenia the effect of fronto-temporal tDCS on dopaminergic transmission is of major interest. As the cortex is densely connected with basal ganglia areas tDCS effects are probably capable to reach subcortical dopaminergic areas. Indeed recent fMRI studies highlighted subcortical effects of tDCS applied at the cortical level including modulations of cortico-striatal and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity. In addition some studies suggest that cortical stimulation by other approaches such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) modulates dopaminergic transmission. However tDCS effects on dopaminergic transmission have been investigated only indirectly. Finally information about biological effects of tDCS is scattered and creating a coherent ensemble is a mandatory and critical step to understand the mechanisms of action of tDCS. According to the hypothesis that fronto-temporal tDCS modulates brain activity connectivity and dopaminergic transmission the aim of this project is to reveal the combined neurobiological impact of an online single session of fronto-temporal tDCS in a unique experiment by developing a simultaneous multimodal imaging approach (PET-MRI). The online implementation of the stimulation will allow deciphering changes induced during and after stimulation. As a first step before investigating patients with schizophrenia healthy subjects will be involved in the present study. The distributed changes will be explored at rest through:   -  Spontaneous functional connectivity assessed by functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI).   -  Brain activity assessed by cerebral blood flow quantitatively and directly measured by arterial spin labelling (ASL).   -  Connectivity assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).   -  Specific and localized dopaminergic transmission evaluated by positron emission tomography (PET) using dopaminergic D2 subtype receptor availability via [11C]raclopride binding. The pioneering aspects of the project are to use an innovative simultaneous multimodal imaging system adopt the tDCS montage used in our validated therapeutic context and apply tDCS online. We expect that our unique approach will provide an imaging biomarker essential to improve our understanding of:   1. the ""normal brain"" and further deficient mechanisms underlying schizophrenia as well as neurological disorders.   2. neurobiological effects of tDCS in order to:   -  Bring key element of the proof of concept of tDCS   -  Optimize tDCS in a therapeutic context   -  Suggest a marker of the therapeutic response    ",NCT03056170

Healthy,Gender in Face-Voice Integration, Bayesian models of perception represent a promising approach to describe information processing by the brain. Predictive coding hypothesizes a process in which top-down expectations are continuously compared across multiple hierarchical levels with bottom-up sensory inputs and the differences or error signals are propagated in a bottom-up direction. The investigators hypothesize that strong expectations are best investigated in expert processes such as face and voice recognition in humans. Individuals in complex social systems need to extract socially relevant information in a fast and efficient manner; hence the majority of humans constitute face voice and gender experts. Nevertheless linking such combined abilities to brain activity with regards to the predictive coding hypothesis has not been attempted.Our results suggest asymmetric contributions of visual and auditory signals to the gender classification task. This sensitive psychophysical procedure is implemented in a decoding approach using fMRI and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA). The investigators plan to test whether cortical areas implicated in processing auditory and visual gender signals show similar asymmetries.    ,NCT03058133

The investigators will ask children from 8 to 14 to complete a standardized math achievement test and measure their brain activity while they process deductive arguments. The investigators will then correlate brain activity during reasoning to individual math skills to identify the brain regions in which activity during reasoning is modulated by math skill.    ,NCT03059758
Healthy,The Change of Tissue Oxygen Saturation Following Volatile Anesthesia, General anesthesia can affect tissue oxygen saturation and microcirculatory reactivity. However the differences in microcirculation caused by anesthetic methods have not been well studied. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures peripheral tissue oxygen saturation noninvasively and can be used in conjunction with vascular occlusion (VOT) experiments. The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in NIRS derived tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and microcirculatory reactivity by VOT after inhalation anesthesia in healthy population. This prospective observational study will be performed on 57 healthy patients who had undergone elective surgery under volatile general anesthesia. The investigators measure StO2 and microvascular reactivity using NIRS combined with vascular occlusion test (VOT). The parameters were performed twice per patient before and after the induction of anesthesia. Occlusion slope and recovery slope during VOT will be compared before and after anesthesia. Moreover the changes depend on the age will be analyzed.    ,NCT03060798

Healthy,Millets and Oats MRI, Breakfast porridges made from milled grains are commonly eaten worldwide. Traditionally different grains are used in different countries. For example oats are more common in the Anglo-Saxon countries whilst millet is very common in parts of India and Africa. However the nutritional value of different grains and their potential effects on the body may vary dramatically: for example the effect on blood sugar on how fast the stomach empties after eating and how full people may feel. RESEARCH QUESTION: The investigators think that a pearl millet breakfast will cause a smaller rise in blood sugar compared with an oat breakfast containing the same number of calories. The investigators also think that there will be a difference in how full people feel and how fast their stomach will empty. These 2 breakfasts will be fed to each one of 26 healthy volunteers one week apart. A safe medical imaging method (MRI) will be used to look at how quickly the breakfast empty from the stomach and how this affects the small bowel. Blood glucose levels will be measured using a finger prick test (the same as used by diabetics) and some small blood samples will be taken from a vein in the arm to measure the chemicals released by the gut after feeding gut hormones.    ,NCT03068039

We expect that cortical regions related with valuation and cognitive regulation such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex operate the modulation of primary olfactory cortex and amygdala. In a second experiment we aim to reveal the brain areas involved in integrating food color cues with odor and taste stimuli. Here we hypothesize that color cues are capable of biasing flavor attributes of food (flavor intensity) and that this bias occurs at different cortical areas commonly associate with multisensory integration such as the orbitofrontal cortex insula amygdala and hippocampus.    ,NCT03095833

Healthy,(18)F-FDG PET Database of Adult Healthy Individuals, Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurological disorder in the world affecting more than 50 million people worldwide. Approximately 35% of patients with epilepsy are refractory to all available antiepileptic drugs. Focal Hypometabolism on interictal [18F]-FDG PET is a hallmark of the Seizure Onset Zone as well as surrounding areas. Using [18F]-FDG PET is thus particularly useful to determine the seizure onset zone of epileptic patients and thus to guide surgical treatment when antiepileptic drugs fail. Interpretation of PET images primarily relies on standard visual analysis but statistical analysis with the widely used Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software improves the diagnostic yield of PET. Over the past years some authors have thus reported that the use of SPM can result in greater sensitivity and specificity of PET imaging in patients with partial epilepsy. In order to perform statistical analysis of PET images to compare brain metabolism of epileptic patients and healthy controls it is necessary to collect a normative database of [18F]-FDG PET images in healthy controls. The purpose of this study is (i) collect a normative database of [18F]-FDG PET images in healthy adults controls to evaluate rigorously the diagnostic value of multimodal imaging for non-invasive localization of the EZ and (ii) to evaluate the test-retest reliability of [18F]-FDG PET scanning.    ,NCT03100227

Healthy,Prebiotic Effect of a Jelly Containing Short Chain Fructo-Oligosaccharides and Sideritis Euboea Extract, The human intestinal microflora is characterized as a complex and dynamic microbial ecosystem with crucial contribution to our nutrition and welfare. Health-promoting genera such as Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. play a key role in digestion of nutrients production of short chain fatty acids and vitamins inhibition of harmful bacteria immunostimulation reduction of blood cholesterol and ammonia levels and restoration of normal flora after antibiotic therapy. Proteolytic species such as toxin-producing clostridia and toxigenic E. coli are considered as potential pathogens with detrimental effects to human host. Recently part of novel food research is directing towards the concept of prebiotics e.g. food ingredients that are not hydrolyzed by the human gastrointestinal tract and beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or limited number of bacteria in the colon that can improve host health. Fructo-oligosaccharides and inulin are considered as the most extensively studied and well-established prebiotics. In vitro and in vivo data suggest the bifidogenic effect of inulin and oligofructose which can be attributed to their selective fermentation by Bifidobacterium species. Due to their documented prebiotic properties both inulin and FOS are increasingly applied in novel food product development through the fortification of commonly ingested foodstuffs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the in vivo prebiotic effect of a functional food containing short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (sc-FOS) and Sideritis euboea extract on the faecal microflora composition of healthy human volunteers.    ,NCT00971113

Healthy,Metabolism of Isotonic Versus Hypotonic Maintenance Solutions in Fasting Healthy Adults, The prescription of intravenous maintenance solutions - although widespread - lacks important data on the optimal sodium and potassium content which has given rise to an important debate in the scientific literature. Our study compares two different infusion fluids in 12 healthy adult volunteers without renal failure in a single-blind randomized crossover design over two 48 hour periods during which subjects are not allowed to eat or drink. Fluid 1 is a premixed solution containing 54 mmol/L of sodium and 26 mmol/L of potassium; fluid 2 is sodium chloride 0.9% in glucose 5% with 40 mmol/L of potassium. Both solutions are administered at 25 mL/kg of ideal body weight as recommended by current guidelines (NICE 174) and both solutions are widely used in daily clinical practice. The primary hypothesis is that isotonic maintenance solutions lead to more fluid retention than hypotonic fluids. Metabolism of both solutions is assessed by sequential analysis of urine and serum clinical parameters and bioelectrical impedance analysis.    ,NCT02822898

Healthy,Effect of Constraining Joint Motions on Postural Control, A major advantage of understanding a neural control scheme is able to simultaneously perform multiple tasks based on the Uncontrolled Manifold (UCM) hypothesis by taking advantage of motor redundancy. The present study aims to investigate this hypothesis further by examining the effect of artificially eliminating knee and lumbar-thoracic joint motions on postural control when the arms performing targeting task simultaneously in standing. Subjects (Younger group: 20~35 years old; Elder group: 60~85 years old) will execute a targeting task with and without an additional ball-balancing task in standing with free joint motions and with restricted joint motions. The investigators expect to recruit 50 subjects for each group. Analyses of joint configuration variance on the stability of the center of mass (COM) position and the hand path will be performed using the UCM method of variance analysis. This method partitions joint configuration variance into one component consistent with the use of motor abundance and a component that leads to COM position or hand path variability. Furthermore the differences between the younger group and the elder group will be evaluated.    ,NCT01703377

Healthy,Does Transcutaneous Vagal Nerve Stimulation Improves Fear Extinction in Humans, A recent study with rats showed that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (VNS) facilitates extinction of fear (Pena Engineer & McIntyre Biological Psychiatry 2013). The hypothesized mechanism is that VNS both enhances memory consolidation (by increasing noradrenergic neurotransmission) and reduces anxiety (thus: preventing fear responses to the CS which may re-consolidate the fear memory). The effect was only apparent when VNS occurred during exposure of the fear conditioned stimulus (CS) and not when stimulation was given immediately following exposure. These results may have implications for the treatment of anxiety disorders in humans. However until recently the only means to investigate the effects of VNS on human fear learning would have required the invasive implantation of vagus nerve stimulators. This has fortunately changed as a non-invasive transcutaneous VNS device has been approved for use in the E.U. for the treatment of psychological disorders. This study proposes to use a t-VNS to investigate its effects on fear learning and extinction in (healthy) humans. Previous research has only investigated the effects it has on human mood and memory. The results obtained suggest that it reduces negative affect and enhances memory findings which are consistent with those reported for rats. It is thus reasonable to expect that t-VNS will facilitate the extinction of fear in humans. The present study aims to answer the following research questions: Does t-VNS during extinction training:   1. accelerates extinction curves   2. reduces spontaneous recovery of previously extinguished fear   3. reduce re-acquisition of fear   4. reduce generalization of fear to other stimuli that resemble the CS+?   5. facilitates the generalization of inhibitory learning to stimuli that resemble the CS-?    ,NCT02113306

Healthy,Post-exercise Food Intake Regulation in a Hot Environment, The potential of physical activity and other non-medicinal methods for the care and prevention of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders has been insufficiently used. There is a potential influence of environmental heat in energetic balance regulation. However the existing knowledge is insufficient to optimize physical activity programs based on the impact of exercise on energy intake regulation in hot climates. The aim of the present study is to define the major physiological determinants of short-term food intake regulation in young active and healthy men when exposed to different levels of metabolic activity and environmental temperatures. We will thus explore the biological mechanisms related to post-exercise relative energy intake. Post-rest and post-exercise energetic compensation will be analysed in these different environmental conditions with a special focus on the effect of the birth weight. This study should open interesting ways to define adequate nutritional and exercising programs in hot environments.    ,NCT02157233

Healthy,Movement Assessment for Concussion Management, Previous work in the area of concussion management has focused heavily on neuro-cognitive testing. In addition to routine neuro-cognitive testing through Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT)this pilot study is designed to establish a comprehensive battery of clinical assessment through the utilization of functional movement and dynamic postural control assessments. The immediate application of these assessments will be focused on the male high school football player (who is at risk for concussion). Our pilot study aims determine the stability of ImPACT testing in youth athletes in light of ongoing neurodevelopment in this population. In addition this pilot work will implement additional tools focused on assessment of dynamic balance reaction time and agility. This approach will significantly enhance predictions of subsequent musculoskeletal injuries that have been shown to occur in concussed collegiate and professional athletes and that we believe are also occurring in our high school athletes. This battery of tests will provide clinicians with invaluable information to guide both rehabilitation of and return to play (RTP) decisions for concussed high school athletes. This pilot study will further track those athletes who sustain a concussion and assess increased risks for musculoskeletal injury.    ,NCT02776904
Healthy,Hypercoagulation Screening in Cancer, There is a complex mutual relationship between cancer and thrombosis. Indeed the tumor has the capacity to activate the hemostatic system and this leads to an increased thrombotic risk in cancer patients. Even in the absence of clinical manifestations cancer patients are commonly characterized by hemostatic abnormalities recognized only by laboratory testing which define the 'hypercoagulable state'. Of interest hypercoagulation has been repeatedly reported to be associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in various carcinomas. On the other hand thrombotic event can represent the first signal of the presence of an occult tumor. These findings suggest that the coagulant pathway might play a role in the preclinical phase of cancer. The investigators hypothesize that a persistent subclinical activation of the hemostatic system in an otherwise healthy subject may predispose not only to thrombosis but also to tumor formation and spreading. A major problem in primary cancer prevention is the lack of effective predictive markers of the disease. The HYPERCAN is an ongoing prospective Italian multicenter study organized around two tightly-interconnected research programs aiming to: 1_the assessment of thrombotic markers as a tool for cancer risk prediction in two large populations of healthy subjects i.e. a group of healthy blood donors of Bergamo and Milano Provinces and a subgroup of Moli-sani subjects of the Molise region; and 2_ the evaluation whether thrombotic markers and/or the occurrence of overt thrombosis (or disseminated intravascular coagulation) may be prognostic of cancer disease outcomes (i.e. overall survival progression free survival in metastatic cancer disease free survival in limited disease) in cancer patients with different types of solid tumors (i.e. breast lung and gastrointestinal cancers). Therefore the assessment of cancer risk occurrence in healthy individuals might be useful for anticipation of cancer diagnosis. In addition the results of this study might help to evaluate whether thrombotic markers may be prognostic of cancer outcomes independently of the disease extension.    ,NCT02622815

Healthy,Healthy Buddies Manitoba, School-based interventions are generally ineffective for preventing weight gain in children. In 2007 a group from the University of British Columbia developed a program called Healthy Buddies that relied on peer mentors to help young children adopt healthy living behaviours. Pilot studies revealed that the program effectively prevented weight gain in children. This trial had never been tested on a large scale using a more scientifically sound study design. We developed a large school-based randomized trial to overcome that limitation and test the hypothesis that that a school-based peer-led healthy living program would reduce adiposity and increase physical activity among children 6-12yrs old.    ,NCT01979978

Healthy,The NICOLA Recruitment Trial (NICOLA-RT), The Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA) is an opportunity to conduct methodology research relevant to many features of a large prospective study. NICOLA will begin in earnest in Northern Ireland in 2013 and is being conducted by a multidisciplinary team in the Centre for Public Health at Queen's University Belfast. It is an omnibus programme of research on ageing that will continue for at least 10 years and will recruit 8500 middle-aged people in Northern Ireland and follow them into old age providing a comprehensive assessment of their physical and mental health their lifestyles and their social and economic decision making. NICOLA will look at how they perceive disability and health and how this differs between well-off and disadvantaged groups. NICOLA will also study various genetic biological and psychological factors including how participants perceive risk and value their time and the effect of this on their retirement behaviour (including how they manage their money and their health). People over the age of 50 will be invited to take part and asked to complete detailed interviews and questionnaires every 2 years and health assessments every 4 years. The overall aim of this research is to examine the impact of differing invitation letters offered to participants on study recruitment rates.    ,NCT01938898
Healthy,The NICOLA Questionnaire Trial (NICOLA-QT), Recruiting retaining and gathering complete data on participants in research projects be they patients or health professionals can be extremely difficult. These problems increase the risk that research will be abandoned before its true value is appreciated or lead to delays in resolving uncertainty for decision makers while further studies are done. Poor recruitment retention and outcome collection frequently lead to many prospective studies being extended increasing costs. Researchers need to use strategies that are themselves evidence-based. This study proposes to link with an existing longitudinal ageing study called NICOLA to provide evidence on what research participants prefer in relation to providing personal information through a self-completed questionnaire. NICOLA is a large study of people over the age of 50 that is being conducted in Northern Ireland. NICOLA is aiming to recruit 8500 people and will ask them questions about participation in social activities including organised structured and informal activities; relationship quality; loneliness; stress; resilience; quality of life; alcohol intake; food poverty and assess their health and wellbeing. Participants in NICOLA agree to having an interviewer visit them at home to ask questions about their lives complete questionnaires in their own time and attend a health assessment appointment. They also agree to being followed up over a course of at least 10 years. The research described here will examine the impact of differing times and formats of a self assessment questionnaire on completion rates specifically:   -  To assess the effect of being given a questionnaire during a face to face interview with a researcher compared to receiving it by post   -  To explore the potential impact of interview fatigue on completion rates    ,NCT01978522

Healthy,Role of Endothelin-1 in Flow-mediated Dilatation, Endothelial dysfunction of conduit arteries contributes to the increased morbidity and cardiovascular mortality in patients with essential hypertension and appears increasingly as an independent therapeutic target. We have shown previously that besides a decrease in the availability of NO and other endothelium-derived vasodilators factors the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids an increase in the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) may play a role in the pathophysiology of this endothelial dysfunction. Indeed the local concentrations of endothelin-1 during the endothelium-dependent dilation of the radial artery in response to a sustained increase in blood flow decreased significantly in healthy volunteers controls but not in hypertensive patients. This lack of adaptation of the endothelinergic system could be due to a decreased clearance of endothelin-1 by endothelial ETB receptors potentiating the vasoconstrictor action of endothelin-1 mediated by ETA receptor activation at the muscular level. However to validate this hypothesis  it is needed to demonstrate the physiological role of ETA receptor and ETB in sustained flow-mediated dilatation of conduit arteries.    ,NCT02086253
Healthy,Diet Induced Intestinal Mucosal Adaptation, Human beings are 'omnivores' meaning that all principal components of food (i.e. the macronutrients: carbohydrates fat proteins) can be assimilated by the gastrointestinal tract. When the gut mucosa is exposed to dietary changes it adjusts its functional behaviour. For example a fatty diet demands certain digestive mechanisms whereas others are needed to take care of a carbohydrate rich diet. Such dietary induced changes in appearance and functionality of the small intestinal mucosa have been described in animals but only little is known about it in man. The present project aims at elucidating in man if a 2 weeks diet dominated by either fat or carbohydrates but with similar energy content is associated with changes in the small intestinal mucosal appearance and metabolic signalling capacity.    ,NCT02088853

Healthy,Circadian Phase Assessments at Home," An estimated 23 million Americans including adolescents and the elderly suffer from circadian rhythm sleep disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder advanced sleep phase disorder and winter depression. These conditions are characterized by persistent insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness impaired performance reduced well being and lower quality of life. The negative symptoms result from a misalignment between the timing of sleep and the internal circadian clock. Clinical research has demonstrated that circadian rhythm sleep disorders are most effectively diagnosed (differentiated from other causes of insomnia) and treated if each individual patient's circadian phase is known. The timing of the master internal circadian clock is most reliably measured from the onset of the endogenous circadian rhythm of melatonin a neuroendocrine hormone as measured in dim light (dim light melatonin onset or ""DLMO""). However to date the reliable and valid assessment of the DLMO is limited to the research laboratory setting. This study is to test a streamlined procedure for the accurate assessment of circadian phase (DLMO) outside of the laboratory that will provide clinicians and researchers with a novel diagnostic and research tool. In this way the underlying neurobiological cause of a patient's insomnia and/or circadian rhythm disorder can more readily be diagnosed and treated. Specific Aim 1 is to validate procedures for at-home circadian phase assessment in a sample of healthy people. Validation will occur by (1) objectively measuring compliance to the at-home procedures and (2) comparing DLMOs collected at home to DLMOs collected in the laboratory in a within-subjects counterbalanced design. Specific Aim 2 is to validate the same at home procedures in patients with delayed sleep phase disorder. Specific Aim 3 is to conduct rigorous analyses to inform future users which subject characteristics and light levels predict (1) compliance to the at home procedures and (2) valid at-home DLMOs. The results of this 3 year study will have substantial implications for the translation of basic and clinical research to the community: (1) the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders will be significantly enhanced thus improving public health and safety mood and quality of life (2) community participation in research will be improved particularly in vulnerable and under represented populations thus increasing scientific knowledge and (3) research and clinical costs will be substantially reduced.

Healthy,Comparison of Postoperative Outcome of Hepatectomy for Living Donors According to Three Different Incision, Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is an important option for patients with end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation. When performing LDLT the safety and well being of donors is of the utmost importance. The conventional incision for donor hepatectomy is a right subcostal incision with a midline extension up to xiphoid. Minimally invasive liver surgery throughout a single 10 cm upper midline incision without laparoscopic assistance has been widely applied and considered to be safe and effective. Recently laparoscopic and minimally invasive living donor hepatectomy via transverse incision has been suggested to reduce morbidity and the invasiveness of living donor hepatectomy. Although minimally invasive approach has become the surgical method of choice for many transplant centers little data on comparing the impact of all three different type incision in living liver donors. In our center the investigators have adopted three different incision according to surgical teams. The investigators undertook this study with the aims of comparing the pain and quality of life of donors according to type of three different incisions and assessing any benefits to the donor due to the smaller midline incision during the early postoperative period.    ,NCT02413983

Healthy,Effect of a Polyphenol-rich Food Supplement on Cognitive Function in Healthy Aging Adults, Several preliminary studies have shown that diet can have beneficial effects on cognitive decline. Among food shown to have such effects are some polyphenols from selected botanicals. Preclinical studies have concluded that polyphenols play a role in moderation of oxidative stress and inflammation increased neuronal signaling and improved metabolic function among other effects. Noteworthy a positive and statistically significant association between the midlife level of polyphenol intake and cognitive function assessed 13 years later was found in a cohort of 2574 adults. Several mechanisms may be involved in these positive effects of food polyphenols on cognitive function in older adults: experimental studies suggest that polyphenols display neuroprotective effects enhancement of the neuronal function stimulation of brain flow and inducing neurogenesis and might prevent age-related damage to the central nervous system through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Based on these promising results a food supplement from botanicals offering complementary polyphenol profile was developed. This food supplement is aimed to aid at maintenance of cognitive function in older adults.    ,NCT02063646

Healthy,Determination of Protein Requirements in Elderly Female Subjects >75 Yrs Old, Minimal data are available on protein requirements throughout the lifespan. Currently available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the nitrogen balance method have been well described. Importantly nitrogen balanced underestimates requirements. The current DRI requirement for healthy adult males is based on the reanalysis of the nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was reanalyzed statistically by Rand et al. and he concluded that the protein requirement of healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83 (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using IAAO the investigators group estimated the protein requirement of young men (mean age 27 years) to be 0.93 and 1.2 g/kg/day (mean and RDA). Currently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition survey conducted by NHANES the authors concluded that adults between the ages of 51 - 70 years old consumed an average on 1.0 g/kg/day (ideal body weight) of protein which represents about 15 % of calories. Depending on the calculations used for ideal body weight some older adults could be getting higher or lower than requirement. There is no scientifically derived protein estimate for older adults. Therefore there is a need to measurer protein requirement in that population. The goal of this study therefore is to measure the protein requirement of female elderly subjects >75 years using the IAAO technique.    ,NCT01604980

Healthy,Continuous Adductor Canal Nerve Blocks: Relative Effects of a Basal Infusion v. Hourly Bolus Doses," Patients usually experience moderate-to-severe pain following the knee replacement that is often treated with a femoral nerve block (injection of numbing medicine placed around the main nerve of the knee joint). To make the nerve block last longer a tiny tube is often placed next to the nerve and numbing medicine is infused for multiple days. However while the numbing medicine takes away pain it also decreases sensations muscle strength and proprioception (knowing where the leg is in space without looking at it) which greatly increases the risk of falling. Since falling can be catastrophic following major surgery a femoral nerve blocks are being phased out by surgeons and anesthesiologists. The most-promising replacement is called an adductor canal nerve block. For this new type of block a perineural catheter is inserted into a small canal in the middle of the upper leg. This canal contains the sensory nerve fibers leading to the knee and only a single nerve that serves a relatively small muscle. Multiple studies have demonstrated a dramatic increase in muscle strength using the new adductor canal block compared with the traditional femoral block. However practitioners perceptions of the new block is that it provides insufficient pain control following knee arthroplasty even though all of the sensory nerves affected with the femoral block are also?theoretically?affected with the adductor canal block. One reason for this difference may be the small canal of the latter which is a relatively tight area in which the numbing medicine might not spread particularly well (due to pressure from surrounding tissues). One way to possibly counter this issue is by providing repeated boluses of the numbing medicine that will improve the medicine's spread relative to a more-traditional slow continuous (""basal"") infusion. This study seeks to compare these two techniques of medication administration through perineural adductor canal catheters: Our primary aim is to test the hypothesis that for continuous adductor canal blocks providing local anesthetic as repeated hourly bolus doses results in an increased sensory block compared with providing local anesthetic as a continuous basal infusion at an equivalent hourly dose. As a secondary aim we hypothesize that for continuous adductor canal blocks providing local anesthetic as repeated hourly bolus doses results in either equivalent or less motor block compared with providing local anesthetic as a continuous basal infusion at an equivalent hourly dose.

Healthy,Processing of Salient Emotional Stimuli as a Function of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD), Attentional blink refers to a phenomenon where the detection of the second of two target stimuli that are presented in Short succession within a stream of stimuli is impaired. This is explained by an insufficient availability of attentional resources. Additionally emotionally salient stimuli like for example pictures with a positive or negative content are detected more often compared to neutral pictures during this attentional blink period. Cannabinoids are involved in the modulation of cognitive attentional and emotional processes. Interestingly data from animals suggests that THC and CBD both active ingredients in the Cannabis sativa plant have opposing effects on brain cannabinoid (CB1) receptors. CB1 receptors modulate the expression of emotionally salient conditioned association in rats if salience processes in humans are modulated in the same way remains unclear. Employing a task to detect salient stimuli Bhattacharyya et al. (2012) showed that THC seems to make non-salient standard stimuli more salient. They showed decreased activation of the right caudate and increased right prefrontal cortex stimuli during processing of salient stimuli. Importantly this was associated with decreased response times to standard relative to oddball stimuli. Generally THC and CBD differentially modulate brain areas associated with attentional salience processing. For example THC seems to increase prefrontal and striatal activation whereas CBD seems to decrease it. The investigators assume that THC increases the number of correctly detected emotional stimuli during the attentional blink period whereas CBD has no effect. Additionally the investigators assume that pictures of the positive category are detected with higher accuracy than negative ones under the influence of THC.    ,NCT02291536

Healthy,The Influence of Glutamate on Memory in Humans, The hippocampus is particularly laden with n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and is at the same time one of the most important sites in declarative memory. The rationale of this study is that the NMDA partial agonist D-Cycloserine will promote learning compared to a placebo. On the other hand the NMDA receptor antagonist Memantine might lead to reduced memory. We believe that the influence of NMDA receptors on memory can be determined via acute co-activation of the NMDA receptors with Cycloserine® (King Pharmaceuticals Ltd active ingredient: DCycloserin dose: 250 mg) and Memantine (Axura® Merz active ingredient: Memantine dose: 20 mg)on both a behavioral and functional (fMRI) level.    ,NCT00980408

Healthy,Could Meditation Modulate the Neurobiology of Learning Not to Fear?, It is well-established that the practice of mindfulness meditation leads to improvements in mental health and well-being and the cultivation of positive emotions. However the neural mechanisms of these improvements are largely unknown. A few recent studies suggest that mindfulness meditation impacts the structure and function of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex the hippocampus and the amygdala. Interestingly recent studies have shown that these regions are part of a brain circuit that is critical for the extinction of conditioned fear responses and for the retention of fear extinction memory. Building on the overlap of these regions and on conceptual considerations the project investigates whether mindfulness meditation could influence one's capacity to retain the memory of fear extinction. Meditation-naïve participants will be randomized to either a mindfulness-meditation based training or an active control training that controls for all mindfulness-unspecific components. Participants will undergo a fear conditioning extinction and extinction recall protocol in an MRI scanner before and after the trainings. We hypothesize that participants who have practiced mindfulness meditation will show greater improvements in fear extinction memory after the course and that these improvements will be correlated with anatomical and functional changes in the brain regions of interest. Improvements in fear extinction memory will also be related to improvements in self-reported psychological well-being. Merging the fields of an ancient spiritual tradition and a fundamental learning mechanism the project investigates the underlying neural mechanisms of a practice for the enhancement of mental health and well-being.    ,NCT01320969

Healthy,Fluoride Intake From Toothbrushig With Children's or Regular Toothpastes, There are controversial data about fluoride intake by children when tooth brushing with children's or regular toothpastes. However a study have showed that children were exposed to a dose of 0.051 mg F/Kg/day and 0.046 mg F/kg/day by tooth brushing with children's and and regular toothpaste respectively. Fluorides doses were too close and is questioned if there is a real clinical relevance in terms of risk of dental fluorosis. It is important to evaluate if children's toothpastes does really represent a risk of fluoride intake when compared to the regular toothpastes in terms of risk of dental fluorosis. The hypothesis is that both children's and regular toothpastes can represente risks of development of dental fluorosis and can represent similar fluoride exposure by children.    ,NCT01568541

Healthy,Circadian Variation of Cardiac Troponin, Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is defined by an increase and/or decrease in the concentration of cardiac troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile value of the reference population together with evidence of ischemia. An objective tool to determine the magnitude of the cardiac troponin change is the use of reference change values (RCV). The basis for this tool is that for a change to be significant the difference in serial results must be greater than the inherent variation in two test results. The inherent variation of a laboratory test result is composed of analytical and within-subject biological variation. An important requirement to use RCVs is that the concentrations of cardiac troponins fluctuate randomly around a homeostatic set point in cardio-healthy individuals. Verification of this important condition has never been performed and violation of this condition would preclude the use of RCV's in clinical practice.    ,NCT02091427

Healthy,The Influence of Aircraft Noise Exposure on Renal Hemodynamic in Healthy Individuals, Epidemiological studies have found a link between aircraft noise exposure and increased incidence of arterial hypertension and thus cardiovascular disease. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The kidney acts as a long-term regulator of blood pressure and controls the extracellular sodium and water balance. Significant renal mechanisms of blood pressure regulation are the renin angiotensin system renal sympathetic activity and sodium excretion. Animal work and clinical studies show that mental stress affects the renal plasma flow and urinary sodium excretion. The investigators observed a lower sodium excretion in situations of mental stress in subjects at risk for developing arterial hypertension. In healthy volunteers a 30-minute mental stress test resulted in increased glomerular filtration rate filtration fraction and an increase in urinary sodium excretion. In this pilot study the investigators analyzed the influence of 30 minutes standardized aircraft noise on renal and central hemodynamics.    ,NCT02783456

Healthy,Do Clinicians Want Recommendations?," The use of the best evidence available for decision-making is nowadays an undisputed goal in health care. However this is not always achieved in the context of clinical practice. Two of the potential solutions to bridge the gap between evidence and the clinical practice are the ""evidence summaries"" and the ""evidence based recommendations"". However it is not clear and frequently controversial to what extent clinicians consider helpful recommendations accompanying evidence summaries. The investigators will explore this question by conducting a study where clinicians will be randomized to receive a clinical scenario accompanied by an evidence summary plus a recommendation and a second clinical scenario accompanied by only for an evidence summary (group A) or vice versa (Group B). The outcome will be clinicians' preferences.    ",NCT02006017

Healthy,Improving Rotavirus Vaccine Immune Response, Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide and is estimated to account for 600000 deaths in children <5 years of age. However live oral enteric vaccines (e.g. OPV cholera vaccines typhoid vaccine) have been less immunogenic in poor communities with high levels of malnutrition and poor sanitation. Rotavirus vaccines also appear to be less immunogenic in the setting where they are most needed. High maternal antibody (IgG) to rotavirus and breast feeding near the time of vaccination may inhibit rotavirus vaccine effectiveness. We propose a quick study to look at practical ways to improve the immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccine in our own setting in Bangladesh. The objectives are to assess if delaying Rotarix vaccination will improve the immune response to the vaccine and to assess if avoiding breastfeeding in the 45 minutes before and after vaccine administration will improve the immune response to administration of Rotarix vaccine. The study will be conducted in the urban Dhaka Mirpur Community a setting where previous rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity studies have been successfully conducted. A total of 300 infant will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups: 1) Administration of Rotarix at 6 and 10 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus vaccine with no intervention in normal breastfeeding practices before and after receiving vaccine. 2) Administration of Rotarix at 6 and 10 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus. Breastfeeding will not be permitted 45 minutes prior to vaccine administration and 45 minutes after each vaccine administration. 3) Administration of Rotarix at 14 and 18 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus with no intervention in normal breastfeeding practices before and after receiving vaccine. 4) Administration of Rotarix at 14 and 18 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus. Breastfeeding will not be permitted 45 minutes prior to vaccine administration and 45 minutes after each vaccine administration. Blood and stool samples will be collected from infants and breast milk from mothers. The primary outcome is to determine the sero-conversion rate of anti-rotavirus IgA in different groups of infants.    ,NCT01825109

Healthy,Effects of Intranasal Administration of a Single Dose of Oxytocin Using a Novel Device in Healthy Adults, Oxytocin (OT) is a small naturally occurring peptide currently in clinical use to stimulate lactation in breastfeeding women. The intranasal administration of OT has recently attracted attention as a potential novel treatment in several psychiatric disorders including autism. However given the anatomy of the nasal cavity the current design of nasal sprays would be expected to provide an inadequate delivery of medication to the areas of the nasal cavity where direct transport into the brain via the olfactory nerve could potentially occur. OptiNose has developed an intranasal delivery device that provides improved reproducibility of nasal delivery improved deposition to the upper posterior regions of the nasal cavity where the olfactory nerve innervates the nasal cavity. The primary objective of this study is to identify any differences between single dose 8 or 24 international units (IU) oxytocin delivered intranasally with the optimised OptiNose device and 1 IU oxytocin administered as slow intravenous infusion in healthy volunteers.

Healthy,Determination of Protein Requirement in Elderly Male Subjects >75 Yrs Old, Minimal data are available on protein requirements throughout the lifespan. Currently available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the nitrogen balance method have been well described. Importantly nitrogen balanced underestimates requirements. The current dietary reference intake (DRI) requirement for healthy adult males is based on the reanalysis of the nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was reanalyzed statistically by Rand et al. and he concluded that the protein requirement of healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83 (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using IAAO our group estimated the protein requirement of young men (mean age 27 years) to be 0.93 and 1.2 g/kg/day (mean and RDA). Currently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition survey conducted by national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) the authors concluded that adults between the ages of 51 - 70 years old consumed an average on 1.0 g/kg/day (ideal body weight) of protein which represents about 15 % of calories. Depending on the calculations used for ideal body weight some older adults could be getting higher or lower than requirement. There is no scientifically derived protein estimate for older adults. Therefore there is a need to measurer protein requirement in that population. The goal of this study therefore is to measure the protein requirement of male elderly subjects > 75 years using the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique.

Healthy,Effects of Lacosamide on Human Motor Cortex Excitability: a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Study, This study has been designed to explore dose-depended effects of lacosamide (LCM) on motor cortex excitability with TMS in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial in young healthy human subjects and to compare the pattern of excitability changes induced by LCM with those of carbamazepine (CBZ). LCM selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channel and in contrast to CBZ does not affect steady-state fast inactivation (Errington et al. 2006). The enhancement of slow inactivation of sodium channels by LCM is a novel manner to modulate sodium channels and leads to normalization of activation thresholds and a reduced pathophysiological hyper-responsiveness thereby effectively controlling neuronal hyperexcitability without affecting physiological activity (Beyreuther et al. 2007). Therefore it is thought that LCM compared to CBZ will be better tolerated in clinical settings while being as or even more effective in controlling seizure activity. On the basis of the results from nonhuman studies it is hypothesized that the TMS profile of LCM will be distinguishable from that of CBZ. CBZ like other 'classical' sodium channel blockers such as phenytoin predominantly demonstrated elevated TMS motor thresholds indicating reduced neuronal membrane excitability without developing significant changes of synaptic intracortical inhibition and facilitation (Ziemann et al. 1996; Chen et al. 1997; Lee et al. 2005). Because of its novel mode of action it can only be speculated which TMS parameters LCM might affect. For example more than exclusively affecting neuronal membrane excitability LCM could possibly also affect inhibitory mechanisms such as short- and long-latency intracortical inhibition (Valls-Sole et al. 1992; Kujirai et al. 1993). This would in line with other well-tolerated modern antiepileptic drugs (Ziemann et al. 1996; Reis et al. 2002; Lang et al. 2006).    ,NCT01382017

Healthy,ITF2984 Repeated Doses Study in Healthy Volunteers, This was a within group randomised repeated dose placebo- and octreotide controlled study in a target population of 45 healthy male subjects. Subjects were required to attend the clinical for screening procedures between 3 and 28 days before dosing commenced. The study was conducted in 4 groups of subjects; Groups 1 to 3 were a double-blinded randomised design each consisting of 12 subjects. Group 4 was an open-label design and consisted of 9 subjects. There was a minimum interval of 96 h between dosing of Groups 1 2 and 3 to allow for interim analyses of PK and safety/tolerability data for dose escalation purposes. Group 4 (the active control group) was still to proceed if the decision was taken to prematurely stop dosing with ITF2984 (somatostatin analogue) following review of the PK and safety data presented at the interim decision meeting; dosing of this group was conducted independently from Groups 1 to 3. On Days 1 to 6 subjects in Groups 1 to 3 were to receive 2 doses of investigational medicinal product (IMP) approximately 12 h apart; subjects in Group 4 were to receive 3 doses of IMP approximately 8 h apart. For all groups subjects were scheduled to receive their final dose of IMP on the morning of Day 7. In addition subjects were to receive exogenous test administrations(stimulation test) on Day -1 Day 1 and Day 7 at the same time on each day (ie for Day -1 23.5 h before the first dose of IMP and for Days 1 and 7 0.5 h after the first dose of IMP on the respective day). Blood samples for PD and PK analyses were taken at specified time points after each dosing. Subjects remained on site for 10 days (ie 36 h after the final dose of IMP on Day 7) providing that discharge conditions had been met and returned to the clinic between 5 and 10 days after the last IMP administration for a follow-up visit.    ,NCT01871844

Healthy,Cerebral Blood Flow and PETCO2 on Neuromuscular Function During Environmental Stress, Environmental stress such as low oxygen availability (hypoxia) has been associated with impaired neuromuscular performance; however the mechanisms associated with these performance decrements remain unclear. While the majority of research suggests that the observed fatigue is related to the central nervous system the influence of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and associated changes in cerebral pH (partial pressure of carbon dioxide; PCO2) remains unexamined. In response to hypoxic stress humans hyperventilate to maintain oxygen consumption resulting in a hypocapnia mediated decrease in CBF and cerebral alkalosis (decreased PCO2). Previous research suggests that hyperventilation induces changes in neural excitability and synaptic transmission; however it remains unclear if these changes are related to hypocapnia mediated decrease in CBF or cerebral alkalosis or both. The purpose of the proposed research program is to examine the influence of changes in CBF and cerebral alkalosis on neuromuscular function during environmental stress. The research program will consist of 2 separate projects summarized below in a table outlining the proposed protocols and resultant physiological manipulations. During each manipulation neuromuscular function will be evaluated and compared to baseline (normoxic) conditions using a repeated measures design. The research program will consist of 2 separate projects. Project 1 will examine the changes in CBF and alkalosis by using (a) indomethacin (decrease CBF; no change PCO2) and (b) hypocapnia (decrease CBF; decrease PCO2). Using a similar experimental design Project 2 will examine the change in CBF and alkalosis during hypoxia by using (a) poikilocapnic hypoxia (decrease PO2; decrease CBF; decrease PCO2) (b) isocapnic hypoxia (decrease PO2; no change CBF; no change PCO2) and (c) isocapnic hypoxia + indomethacin (decrease PO2; decrease CBF; no change PCO2). During each manipulation neuromuscular function will be evaluated and compared to baseline (normoxic) conditions using a repeated measures design. Therefore Project 1 will examine the separate and combined effect of changes in CBF and cerebral alkalosis on neuromuscular function independent of environmental manipulations. Subsequently Project 2 will examine neuromuscular function during hypoxia while controlling CBF and cerebral alkalosis. It is hypothesized that changes in PCO2 and therefore changes in cerebral alkalosis will contribute to neuromuscular fatigue independent of changes in CBF and oxygen availability.    ,NCT01830335

Healthy,The Influence of Cerebral Blood Flow and PETCO2 on Neuromuscular Function During Passive Heat Stress, Increased core temperature (hyperthermia) has been associated with impaired neuromuscular performance; however the mechanisms associated with these performance decrements and their potential synergies remain unclear. While the majority of research suggests that the observed fatigue is related to the central nervous system the influence of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and associated changes in cerebral alkalosis (estimated by end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide; PETCO2) remains unexamined. In response to hyperthermia humans hyperventilate as means of heat dissipation resulting in a hypocapnia (reduced PETCO2) mediated decrease in CBF and consequently cerebral alkalosis (increased cerebral pH). Previous research suggests that hyperventilation induces changes in neural excitability and synaptic transmission; however it remains unclear if these changes are related to hypocapnia mediated decrease in CBF or decreased PETCO2 or both. The purpose of the proposed research program is to examine the influence of changes in CBF and cerebral alkalosis on neuromuscular function during passive heat stress. The research project will consist of 3 separate experimental trials: (a) poikilocapnic hyperthermia (increased core temperature; decrease CBF; decrease PETCO2) (b) isocapnic hyperthermia (increased core temperature; no change CBF; no change PETCO2) and (c) isocapnic hyperthermia + indomethacin (increased core temperature; decrease CBF; no change PETCO2). During each manipulation neuromuscular function will be evaluated and compared to baseline (normothermic) conditions using a repeated measures design. It is hypothesized that changes in PETCO2 and therefore changes in cerebral alkalosis will contribute to neuromuscular fatigue independent of changes in CBF or increases in core temperature.    ,NCT01848665

Healthy,Determination of Protein Requirement in Elderly Male Subjects 65-75 Yrs Old., Minimal data are available on protein requirements throughout the lifespan. Currently available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the nitrogen balance method have been well described. Importantly nitrogen balanced underestimates requirements. The current dietary reference intakes (DRI) requirement for healthy adult males is based on the reanalysis of the nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was reanalyzed statistically by Rand et al. and he concluded that the protein requirement of healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83 (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) our group estimated the protein requirement of young men (mean age 27 years) to be 0.93 and 1.2 g/kg/day (mean and RDA). Currently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition survey conducted by national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) the authors concluded that adults between the ages of 51 - 70 years old consumed an average on 1.0 g/kg/day (ideal body weight) of protein which represents about 15 % of calories. Depending on the calculations used for ideal body weight some older adults could be getting higher or lower than requirement. There is no scientifically derived protein estimate for older adults. Therefore there is a need to measurer protein requirement in that population. The goal of this study therefore is to measure the protein requirement of male elderly subjects between the ages of 65 - 75 years using the IAAO technique.    ,NCT01943266

Healthy,Effects of Cranberry Consumption in Vascular Function in Healthy Individuals, Accumulating evidence from epidemiological and human intervention studies indicates that the cardiovascular health benefits of diets rich in fruits and vegetables are (in part) related to their (poly)phenol content. Cranberries are rich in (poly)phenols compounds in particular anthocyanins but also phenolic acids. At present a small number of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of berry (poly)phenols on validated surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease risk has shown promising results. However to date very few human studies have specifically investigated the effects of cranberry (poly)phenols on cardiovascular function in healthy subjects. To our knowledge no study has investigated the time and intake-dependent effect of cranberry consumption on vascular function in healthy subjects. This information is necessary for the planning of long-term studies aiming to assess the potential beneficial effects of cranberries using optimal amounts at optimal time points. Therefore this study aims to investigate the potential role of cranberry (poly)phenols in the modulation of vascular function by monitoring changes in vascular function together with the major (poly)phenol derivatives/metabolites in plasma and urine.    ,NCT02517775

Healthy,Urinary Excretion of Acetylamantadine by Normal Healthy Volunteers, Amantadine appears to be a specific substrate for acetylation by spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT). SSAT activity in cancer cells is higher by several-fold compared to normal cells. Amantadine can be used to determine SSAT cellular activity and may indicate the presence of cancer. This study will provide additional information in conjunction with data from a previous study which include cancer patients and normal health age matched controls to determine whether urinary excretion of acetylamantadine is predictive for the presence of cancer and if so whether excretion of this metabolite is associated with any particular site of the tumor. Based on the results of the first study additional data in normal healthy volunteers is required. The data from both studies will be analyzed to account for subject gender stage of disease at time of testing concurrent diseases alcohol and tobacco use and occupational characteristics. This is an important first step in validating a cancer detection method that can be implemented economically for screening of large numbers of people at sites remote from limited and expensive diagnostic instrumentation.

Healthy,Usability and Reliability of a New Physical Therapy Tool," Rehabilitation exercise conducted at home following injury improves clinical and functional outcomes. Optimum compliance with prescribed exercise regimens requires regular patient instruction performance assessment monitoring and general encouragement from healthcare staff. Exercise at home though convenient for patients is not conducive for provision of the professional support needed to maximize prescribed regimen effectiveness. Software in development by Reflexion Health Inc. along with the Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) is being designed to facilitate remote staff-patient interaction during at-home rehabilitative exercise sessions. Microsoft Kinect® will serve as the hardware platform for the designed software package tentatively called ""Reflexion."" Kinect® contains a marker-less/controller-less motion tracking camera. The final Reflexion software will rely on a ""Rehabilitation Measurement Tool (RMT)"" to detect cardinal plane skeletal joint movement and its velocity utilizing the embedded Kinect® camera while also providing patient visual feedback via an avatar on a television screen. In this observational minimal risk study RMT/Kinect® functional reliability and usability will be assessed. Twenty healthy subjects will physically set-up and turn-on the hardware/software system; receive exercise directions from the RMT; then conduct a series of knee exercises similar to those prescribed after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair. An initial limited data set obtained by Reflexion Health provided validity and reliability measures. Eighteen degrees of absolute difference was detected between manual goniometry and Kinect® measurements in relevant planes of movement utilized during prescribed ACL exercise. Good relative agreement between RMT and goniometry scores was obtained (ICC = 0.89). A correctable systematic bias toward underestimation by the RMT will allow for future more accurate estimations of joint positioning improving face validity. RMT functional reliability and general usability will be expressed in this study utilizing descriptive statistics and scaled questionnaires. Hardware component malfunction (Kinect® camera laptop PC or LCD television/monitor) as well as RMT internally logged software errors and failure will tallied and measured to ascertain RMT reliability. User-RMT interaction quality will be evaluated with video recordings of each set-up and exercise session. Specifically usability measures will include: need for additional assistance setting-up or operating the RMT; number of attempts required by the subject to interact with a specific feature: time spent on specific elements during the session. Participant feedback will be elicited post-session using two scaled questionnaires: System Usability Scale (SUS)and Reflexion Usability Scale (RUS). Findings from the study will guide software modifications needed prior to implementation of future clinical studies within the NMCSD population.    ",NCT01727856

Healthy,Ferrous Fumarate and Ferric Pyrophosphate as Food Fortificants in Developing Countries, Iron fortification of foods is usually considered the most cost-effective approach to prevent iron deficiency. However iron is the most difficult mineral to add to foods. When added as water-soluble highly bioavailable compounds such as ferrous sulfate the soluble iron rapidly catalyzes fat oxidation resulting in rancid products. In addition water-soluble iron compounds can cause unacceptable color reactions during storage and food preparation. Thus food manufacturers are often obliged to use water-insoluble iron compounds to fortify foods and fortification compounds such as elemental Fe powder and ferric pyrophosphate are widely used to fortify cereal flours and infant cereals. However these compounds never dissolve completely in the gastric juice and are usually far less well absorbed than ferrous sulfate (Hurrell 1997). Ferrous fumarate on the other hand although almost insoluble in water readily dissolves in the gastric juice and has been shown to have an equivalent absorption to ferrous sulfate in healthy Western adults (Hurrell et al. 1989 2000). Because it is non-water soluble it causes relatively few sensory problems in the fortified foods and is therefore an interesting food fortificant. Iron absorption from ferrous fumarate has been demonstrated to be significantly higher than from ferric pyrophosphate in European infants (Davidsson et al. 2000) and this compound is currently used to fortify blended cereal flours for food aid programs and commercial infant cereals in Europe. However based on our recent study in Bangladeshi children there is now concern that due to lower gastric acid output young children in developing countries may not be able to absorb ferrous fumarate as well as Western adults (Davidsson et al. 2001a Sarker et al. 2001 2003). Clearly there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of water insoluble iron compounds to prevent the development of iron deficiency/iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children living in developing countries. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ferrous fumarate and ferric pyrophosphate as compared to ferrous sulfate as food fortificants in preventing development of anemia/IDA in Bangladeshi infants and young children (part I). A potential cause of low gastric acid secretion in Bangladesh and many developing countries is Helicobacter pylori infection. Although H. pylori-infection appeared to have no influence on absorption of ferrous fumarate in children the impact of chronic H. pylori infection in adults could be expected to be more pronounced due to long time effects on the gastric mucosa resulting in reduced gastric acid output. The other aim of the study is therefore to assess of iron absorption and gastric acid output in adult women of child-bearing age with H. pylori infection (part II). Two hundred and forty non-anemic Children (Hb>105 g/L) will be randomized to three study groups; ferrous fumarate ferric pyrophosphate or ferrous sulfate (n=80 per group) in wheat flour- and cow milk-based infant formula and will be fed for 9 months. Hemoglobin serum ferritin and transferin receptor will be analyzed at baseline and after 4.5 and 9 months of intervention. Prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency during and after the intervention among the three groups will be compared (part I). We furthermore propose a complementary study to determine the relative absorption of ferrous fumarate (relative to ferrous sulfate) in H. pylori infected and non-infected adult Bangladeshi women (15 each) of 20-40 year of age with IDA using stable isotope technique based on the incorporation of iron stable isotopes into erythrocytes 14 days after administration. Assessment of gastric acid output will also be performed. Iron stature and absorption and assessment of gastric acid output will be compared before and after therapy in H. pylori infected women (part II). The results of this study are expected to have implications in the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia in developing countries    ,NCT00867867

Healthy,Effects of White Wine vs. Tea Intake During and an Alcoholic Digestive Following a High Fat High Calorie Cheese Fondue Meal on Gastric Emptying and Abdominal Symptoms in Healthy Volunteers, Tradition holds that the intake of different drinks with a meal has an important influence on the digestion of food and postprandial symptoms such as fullness bloating and satiety; however this assumption have never been subjected to controlled study A classic example is the Swiss cheese fondue. The intake of white wine tea and cherry schnapps (Kirsch) are often attributed either positive or negative effects on the gastrointestinal tract. In this study the effect of white wine vs. tea intake during and an alcoholic digestive following a high fat high calorie Swiss fondue meal on gastric emptying and visceral perception will be investigated using a randomized controlled study design. The fondue will be labeled with non-radioactive 13C octanoate for assessment of gastric emptying by breath-test.    ,NCT00943696
Healthy,Renal Salt Handling in Postural Tachycardia Syndrome Following Dietary Dopa Administration, The purpose of this study is to learn how plants can play a role in gain/loss of sodium in the urine and in the regulation of blood pressure. Dopamine is a chemical mostly present in the brain and kidneys which assists in regulation of the body's salts (sodium and potassium). Fava beans contain a lot of the chemical that increases the production of dopamine by the kidneys. The purpose of these studies is to characterize the diuretic effects of dietary catecholamine sources in healthy individuals. Specific aims are:   1. To determine the effect of dietary dopa sources on plasma and urinary catecholamines.   2. To investigate the capacity of botanical dopaminergic agents (fava beans) to induce natriuresis in a short term study.   3. To provide preliminary data on the effects of dietary dopa on heart rate and blood pressure. In these studies we will test the null hypothesis (Ho) that urinary sodium excretion will not differ in healthy volunteers after consumption of a fixed-sodium study diet and the study diet plus fava beans.    ,NCT01064739
Healthy,Human Intestinal Amino Acid Absorption and the Role of a Local (Renin)-Angiotensin System (RAS), Aim of this trial is to investigate the expression and localisation of different amino acid transporters and their regulatory proteins derived from the regulatory proteins of the local renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the intestine.

Healthy,Ultrasonography Detection of Local Twitch Response During Dry Needling, Background: One treatment of Muscle trigger points (MTrPs) is deep dry needling (DN) with the purpose of obtaining local twitch responses (LTRs) which are highly effective in releasing MTrPs. In DN procedures the mechanisms associated with LTRs and the LTR intensities required for optimal clinical results are poorly understood especially in relation to range of motion after intervention. Therefore evaluating the intensity of LTRs is relevant for implementing DN in different clinical settings such as in patients with muscular or neurological dysfunctions. One way to assess muscle contractions and LTRs is through ultrasound video analysis. The aim of this report was to evaluate the reliability of semi-automatic LTR intensities tracking during dry needling by assessing ultrasound signals with an image processing method in addition to evaluating the relationship between LTR intensities and muscle elasticity. Method: Young males without signs or symptoms of musculoskeletal pain were included. Primary outcome measure was the LTR intensities determined by percentage change of muscle thickness. The secondary outcome measures were the muscle elasticity of medial gastrocnemius and hamstring previous and posterior DN in both lower limbs for each subject. Three LTRs detected by a physical therapist and ultrasound assessment were induced by inserting a filament needle into muscle latent trigger points in medial gastrocnemius. The intensities of LTRs were measured by assessing ultrasound images using an optical flow method and through comparisons with manual detection.    ,NCT02824991
Healthy,EIT Study With Healthy Patients, Patients with severe respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) can benefit from having non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Non-invasive ventilation consists of a machine (ventilator) that is blowing air through a mask. NIV provides patients with a bigger expansion of their lung when they are breathing. This better expansion helps patients to have more oxygen and less waste gas (or carbon dioxide) in their body. These improvements enhance survival and quality of life. In order to provide appropriate ventilation for each patient the ventilator can generate different types of blowing:   -  Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which delivers a constant pressure to the mask   -  Pressure support ventilation (PSV) which delivers a constant pressure to the mask and on top of that delivers more pressure when the patient begins to breathe in.   -  Pressure control ventilation (PCV) which is similar to PSV but use a fixed time to generate the flow when the patient begins to breathe in. These different types of blowing have consequences on patient comfort as well as on the improvement of their ventilation. To assess the improvement of the ventilation the investigators currently use blood tests however these reflect overall output and may miss more subtle changes in breathing that could affect how patients feel. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a new technology that involves wearing a belt of sensors around the chest that provides information on how well the lungs are being filled with air by the ventilator. It allows a non-invasive assessment of the effect of NIV onto lung ventilation in real-time. The investigators hope to use the EIT technology to assess in real-time patients lung ventilation when they are using the NIV. The investigators hope that EIT will provide them with information on which type of blowing is more effective and more comfortable than the others.    ,NCT02828007
