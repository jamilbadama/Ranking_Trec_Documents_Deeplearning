Breast Cancer,Maintenance Versus Observation After 6 Cycles of Gemcitabine Plus Paclitaxel in Pts With Advanced Breast Cancer, The primary goal of therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer is palliation and prolongation of life with quality. Although there are no randomized trials comparing chemotherapy with supportive care in women with metastatic breast cancer chemotherapy clearly provides a survival benefit in metastatic breast cancer. Due to diagnosis at earlier phases of metastatic disease and more effective therapies the median survival of patients treated with modern taxane-based chemotherapy is now reaching approximately 2 years. The duration of chemotherapy in patients responding or stable disease remains controversial since quality of life is not usually adversely affected and may even be improved in many patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. In addition many commonly used chemotherapeutic agents are not limited by cumulative toxicity in metastatic breast cancer patients. Several studies investigated the role of maintenance chemotherapy suggest that maintenance chemotherapy is associated with superior time to progression but no survival gain. However these randomized trials did not incorporate taxane-based chemotherapeutic regimens the new standard of care in metastatic breast cancer patients these days. A 1998 metaanalysis of 1986 patients randomly assigned between combination chemotherapy and single-agent therapy in metastatic breast cancer patients demonstrated a survival advantage to combination chemotherapy with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (range 0.75 to 0.90). Although there are several randomized trials showing negative results for survival gain in patients who received maintenance chemotherapy the role of maintenance chemotherapy with newer agents such as docetaxel or paclitaxel have not been established yet. Although Italian MANTA trial demonstrated no difference in PFS or survival between the two arms their metaanalysis advocated survival benefit of maintenance therapy. Since gemcitabine/paclitaxel (GP) combination chemotherapy is one of the two regimens which showed definite survival gain with favorable toxicity from a randomized trial we plan to randomize patients who responded to six cycles of GP induction chemotherapy to receive additional maintenance GP chemotherapy until disease progression versus observation. We hypothesize that patients who receive maintenance GP chemotherapy will do better in terms of progression free survival.    ,NCT00561119

Breast Cancer,Developing Plasma DNA as a Surrogate for Tumor Biopsy to Identify Tumor Genetic Alterations in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer, There are three major subtypes of breast cancer:   1. Hormone receptor positive (contain cells that express the estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor).   2. Tumors that express the epidermal growth factor receptor gene ( HER-2)   3. Triple negative (cancer cells that lack the hormone receptors and the epidermal growth factor receptor gene HER-2. While effective therapies exist for most cases of breast cancer at first occurrence many patients eventually exhibit disease that does not respond to all standard breast therapies particularly in the metastatic setting. There are therapies that are used to treat other types of cancers with genetic mutations that are in the process of being evaluated for use in breast cancer. The current techniques used for detecting mutations in the genes of breast cancer patients which can be treated with drugs specific for the genetic mutations are invasive and identifying effective diagnostic non-invasive procedures are the next challenge for physicians. This study will compare the ability to detect genetic mutations samples from non-invasive procedures such as a blood draw to more invasive procedures such as tissue taken from a biopsy sample. There is also a concern with current techniques used to detect genetic mutations that cells from a single tissue sample may not be representative of the types of cells present in all the tumors in the body and therapies selected using a single tissue sample may not be effective for all of the cancer in the body. This study will use blood drawn from participants prior to any drug therapy and compare the genes from this blood to tissue samples from multiple sites of disease. The study will also compare the genetic profile of the metastatic tumors to the genetic profile of the original breast cancer to determine if there are any changes in the genetics of the tumor cells. The participants that have newly diagnosed metastatic disease will provide tissue from their primary site of disease via an image guided biopsy. These participants will also provide tissue from at least 2 other distant metastatic sites (lung pleural/peritoneal liver brain or skin). Each biopsy procedure will attempt to obtain 2-3 samples for research purposes. Participants that have locally recurrent disease in the breast will have the tissue from the site of re-occurrence biopsied as well as two distant metastatic sites (lung pleural/peritoneal liver brain or skin). Participants that have either multi-centric disease or bilateral disease will have all tumors sampled with the intention of providing 2-3 samples/tumor for research purposes. Participants with multi-centric and bilateral disease will also have 2 distant sites of distant disease sampled (lung pleural/peritoneal liver brain or skin). Prior to any scheduled biopsy procedures all participants will have a blood draw used to examine the genetics of the tumor cells in the blood. The participants will have 8 tubes of blood drawn for the test and then they will proceed onto the tissue sampling portion of the study.    ,NCT01836640

Breast Cancer,Study With LDE225 in Combination With Docetaxel in Triple Negative (TN) Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC) Patients, This is a single-arm open-label phase Ib study. In this trial patients with Triple Negative (TN) Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC) will be treated with increasing doses of LDE225 and docetaxel to determine the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) and RP2D (Recommended Phase II Dose) of the combination. Eligible patients with hormonal receptors negative and HER2 negative ABC will be included and treated with docetaxel intravenously in every three weeks cycles. LDE225 will be administered orally at three dose levels 400 600 and 800mg QD (a -1 dose level is included just in case dose de-escalation is needed). Treatment will be repeated on day 1 of a 21-day cycle until radiographic or symptomatic progression unacceptable toxicity or withdraws informed consent. The investigators propose to develop a phase Ib trial with the combination of docetaxel with LDE225 in TN ABC patients to define the safety tolerability and RP2D as well as to have some information about the efficacy of the combination. Primary Objective: To determine the MTD and RP2D of LDE225 administered orally in combination with docetaxel in TN ABC patients.

Breast Cancer,ARRY-380 + Trastuzuamab for Breast w/ Brain Mets," The purpose of this study is to test the safety of different doses of ARRY-380 in combination with trastuzumab. Trastuzumab is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of HER2 metastatic breast cancer. However the combination of ARRY-380 and trastuzumab has not yet been tested. Both agents block the HER2 receptor which is thought to be overactive in HER2-positive breast cancer. It is thought that ARRY-380 and trastuzumab might work together because they attach to different parts of the HER2 receptor and prevent it from functioning. Because HER2 positive breast cancer contains high levels of HER2 receptor but normal cells in your body generally do not the drugs may be able to ""target"" the cancer cells. In addition in laboratory studies ARRY-380 appears to have some penetration into the brain.    ",NCT01921335

Breast Cancer,A Phase I Study of Infusional Chemotherapy With the P-Glycoprotein Antagonist PSC 833," The clinical study entitled ""A Phase I Study of Infusional Chemotherapy with the P-glycoprotein Antagonist PSC 833"" seeks to determine the maximum tolerated dose for a proposed P-glycoprotein antagonist PSC 833. PSC 833 is a cyclosporine analogue which is purportedly non-nephrotoxic and non-immunosuppressive. It has been shown in in-vitro studies to enhance chemosensitivity as well as cyclosporine and to be far better at increasing intracellular drug accumulation than the concentrations of verapamil which are clinically achievable. The purpose of this study is to define the maximum tolerated dose in combination with vinblastine and to determine how the drug affects the pharmacokinetics of vinblastine. PSC 833 will most likely reduce the clearance of vinblastine as reported for the parent compound cyclosporine. This effect will increase the area under the curve (AUC) of vinblastine may increase toxicity and requires that the escalation scheme for PSC 833 be a conservative one. Initially a 120 hour infusion of vinblastine will be given alone. Then 8 days of PSC 833 will follow to allow monitoring of adverse effects of PSC 833 alone. This first cycle of vinblastine will be given in the absence of PSC 833; in second and subsequent cycles both agents will be combined. Escalation of the PSC 833 will continue until a target concentration is reached or until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Clinical responses will be monitored in order to provide the best possible medical care to our patients.    ",NCT00001302

Breast Cancer,Methods in Education for Breast Cancer Genetics, In 1997 the Genetics Department of the NCI Medicine Branch helped establish a breast cancer genetics program at the National Naval Medical Center s Breast Care Center. Genetic education counseling and germline testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 two genes which confer increased lifetime risks for breast and ovarian cancer were offered under a Navy IRB-approved study. Sixty participants received education and counseling on that protocol 49 of whom chose to have genetic testing. The education and counseling provided by oncology nurses trained in cancer genetics focused on preparing participants to make well-informed decisions about testing. Included were information on cancer and genetics; hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome; risks benefits and limitations of BRCA1/BRCA2 testing; and screening and risk reduction options for high-risk individuals. Through our experience with this study we devised two different methods of providing this information. Both of these methods were well received and appear to be equally effective as measured by knowledge assessments before and after the sessions and subjective evaluation by the participants. We will now study them in a randomized fashion in the current protocol to better evaluate whether one method is preferable. Ultimately we hope to be able to make recommendations that will allow for access to genetic education and counseling for more individuals in a more cost efficient manner.    ,NCT00001806
Breast Cancer,Effects of Raloxifene on the Uterus and Ovaries of Premenopausal Patients, This research study is designed to work in cooperation with another study being conducted by the National Cancer Institute. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is studying the effects of a drug called raloxifene on premenopausal women believed to have a high risk of developing breast cancer (98-C-0123). In this study researchers are interested in learning about the effects of raloxifene on the uterus and ovaries of the women participating in the NCI study. To do this researchers plan to conduct ultrasounds on the patients enrolled in the NCI study. In addition researchers plan to take samples of the lining of the uterus in these patients (endometrial biopsy) if found to be necessary. The purpose of this study is to determine the reproductive effects of raloxifene on women who have normal functioning ovaries by taking ultrasounds of the ovaries and lining of the uterus (endometrium).    ,NCT00001837
Breast Cancer,Vinorelbine and XR9576 to Treat Cancer, Tumor resistance to anti-cancer drugs is a major problem in cancer treatment. Studies have found that a protein (P-glycoprotein) on some cancer cells pumps chemotherapy drugs out of the cells reducing treatment effectiveness. In laboratory tests an experimental drug called XR9576 has blocked pumping by this protein. It is being used in this study to try to increase the amount of the anti-cancer drug vinorelbine in cancer cells. Vinorelbine has been shown in several clinical trials to be effective against some advanced cancers including breast lung and ovarian and is one of the drugs pumped out of tumor cells by P-glycoprotein. Patients with cancer 18 years and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with tests that may include blood and urine tests electrocardiogram echocardiogram CT scans X-rays and nuclear medicine studies. A tumor biopsy may be done for diagnostic or research purposes. Study participants will undergo tumor imaging with the radioactive drug Tc-99m Sestamibi. This drug accumulates in tumor cells and is eliminated from them in much the same way that some cancer drugs are eliminated from cells. The drug is injected into a vein and a series of pictures are taken with a gamma camera. After this baseline scan patients will receive a dose of XR9576 and undergo a second scan 24 hours later. The scan will show whether XR9576 affects the accumulation and elimination of Sestamibi in tumor cells. This procedure may provide a way to monitor cancers for evidence of chemotherapy resistance and show if XR9576 can improve the effectiveness of therapy. At least 10 days after the baseline and XR9576 scans patients will begin the first of 3 or more 21-day cycles of vinorelbine treatment. On days 1 and 8 of each cycle patients will receive a 30-minute infusion of XR9576 intravenously (through a vein) followed by vinorelbine infused over a 6- to 10-minute period. (In some patients XR9576 will be administered before only one of the two vinorelbine dosages.) Physical examination blood tests and other procedures may be done periodically to monitor treatment.    ,NCT00001944

Breast Cancer,Primary Chemotherapy With Docetaxel-Capecitabine and Doxorubicin-Cyclophosphamide in Breast Cancer," This study will assess the usefulness of a technique called complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray-an examination of a wide array of genes to identify disease-associated patterns-for measuring tumor response to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. The study will look for ""markers"" that can help select the most effective type of chemotherapy. It will also evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new drug combination of capecitabine and docetaxel. Patients age 18 years and older with stage II or III breast cancer whose tumor is 2 centimeters or larger may be eligible for this study. Those enrolled will be treated with surgery standard chemotherapy using doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the capecitabine and docetaxel combination. Patients will have a physical examination mammogram and magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate their tumor before beginning treatment. They will then have four 21-day treatment cycles of docetaxel and capecitabine as follows: docetaxel intravenously (through a vein) on day 1 and capecitabine pills (by mouth) twice a day from days 2 through 15. No drugs will be given from days 16 through 21. This regimen will be repeated four times after which the tumor will be re-evaluated by physical examination mammogram and magnetic resonance imaging. Patients will then have surgery to remove the cancer-either lumpectomy with removal of the underarm lymph nodes; mastectomy and removal of the underarm lymph nodes; or modified radical mastectomy. After recovery they will have four more cycles of chemotherapy this time with a doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Both drugs will be given intravenously on day 1 of four 21-day cycles. Some patients who had a mastectomy (depending on their tumor characteristics and whether tumor cells were found in their lymph nodes) and all those who had a lumpectomy will also have radiation therapy. Patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors will also receive tamoxifen treatment for 5 years. In addition to the above procedures all patients will have tumor biopsies (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue) before beginning treatment on day 1 of cycle 1 before cycle 2 and at the time of surgery and physical examinations chest X-rays bone scans computerized tomography (CT) scans electrocardiograms multi-gated acquisition scan-MUGA (nuclear medicine test of cardiac function) or echocardiograms of heart function mammograms and blood tests at various times during the study. Patients will be followed at National Institutes of Health (NIH) for 3 years after diagnosis with physical examinations blood tests X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans. Although it is not known whether this treatment will help an individual patient's cancer possible benefits are tumor shrinkage and decreased risk of disease recurrence. In addition the information gained about genetic changes after chemotherapy will help determine if additional studies on the use of cDNA microarray to measure tumor response are warranted.

It will also try to determine if breast tissue characteristics in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation differ from those in women with a normal gene. Premenopausal women between 25 and 45 years of age who have participated in National Cancer Institute studies for families or individuals at high genetic risk of cancer (78-C-0039 or 99-C-0081) and who have at least a 50 percent probability of carrying an altered BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene may be eligible for this study. At the first visit participants will have from 4 to 24 tablespoons of blood drawn and will be interviewed about breast and ovarian cancer risk factors family and personal history of cancer history of pregnancies use of oral contraceptives and other hormones and drugs and previous surgery on the breasts and ovaries. In addition they will undergo the following procedures: Routine breast and ovarian cancer screening for high-risk women including a mammogram breast and pelvic exam instruction in breast self-examination CA 125 blood test and transvaginal ultrasound of the ovaries. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the breast MRI uses a strong magnetic field to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. Breast Duct Lavage In this procedure samples of fluid and cells from the lining of the breast milk ducts are collected to look for cancerous or pre-cancerous cell changes. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan PET scanning will be done only in participants whose mammogram or MRI findings require additional evaluation.

We will recruit up to fifty women (twenty-five women who carry an altered BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and 25 non-carriers matched by age and family mutation type) with regular menstrual cycling (documented by menstrual history and premenopausal FSH level). A physical exam including exam of the breast and pelvis a standard four view mammogram breast MRI and PET scan will be scheduled initially during either the follicular or mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. A unilateral cranio-caudal mammogram and bilateral MRI and PET scan will be repeated three months after entry during the phase not initially studied. A CA125 and transvaginal color doppler ultrasonography will be done in the follicular phase. Carriers and non-carriers will be compared with respect to menstrual cycle differences in: (1) two measures of mammographic density (qualitative and semiquantitative); (2) a semiquantitative measure of fibroglandular volume (MRI); (3) a semiquantitative measure of contrast enhancement (MRI); and (4) FDG uptake measured over time (PET scan). On the initial and three-month visit all participants will undergo breast duct lavage to investigate if there are consistent menstrual cycle differences in breast ductal cytologies. Participants will be seen annually thereafter for an additional three years of follow-up. A physical exam standard four-view mammography breast MRI CA 125 transvaginal color doppler ultrasonography and breast duct lavage will be done annually. Consent for a PET study will be requested if an abnormality is detected on mammography or breast MRI requiring additional clinical or radiographic follow-up. Participants in the Menstrual Cycle Pilot Study will complete a self-administered questionnaire and telephone interview and will complete periodic follow-up questionnaires to assess various behavioral and psychosocial endpoints. As part of the Menstrual Cycle Pilot Study we will recruit 25 volunteers to assist in training study investigators in performing breast duct lavage.

Breast Cancer,Phase I/II Trial of Doxil and Hyperthermia for Breast Cancer Patients With Chest Wall Recurrence or Stage IV Disease With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer, Purpose: The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the combination of Doxil chemotherapy and heat treatment for recurrent breast cancer located on the chestwall following mastectomy. This protocol also includes patients with metastatic breast cancer who have not had mastectomy but have advanced tumor remaining within the breast. Doxil is the drug adriamycin (also called doxorubicin) encapsulated in liposomes which coats the drug with a small amount of lipid (fat). This chemotherapy is in a newer form which can be better delivered to the tumor tissue without causing as much systemic toxicity. We are combining heat treatment with this drug in an effort to further increase the delivery of drug to the tumor which may give an increased tumor response. Methods: The patients will be treated with chemotherapy followed by heat treatment. This will be given for 6 cycles approximately every 4 weeks. For the first cycle patients will need to be hospitalized 3 days for measurement of blood levels of drug as well as some additional radiology studies which will help us to determine whether the drug is preferentially distributed within tumor.    ,NCT00006433

Patients 18 years of age or older with stage inflammatory breast cancer who have not been treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination blood and urine tests chest x-ray electrocardiogram and MUGA scan or echocardiography (see below). A mammogram of both breasts dynamic MRI imaging of the affected breast computed tomography (CT) of the head chest abdomen and pelvis and a bone scan are done to determine the extent of disease. Participants undergo the following procedures at various intervals before during and/or after completing chemotherapy: Tumor and skin biopsies to study the effects of bevacizumab on tumor blood vessels tumor growth and the biology of inflammatory breast cancer. A small piece of tumor tissue and a small piece of skin from the affected breast are removed under local anesthesia for microscopic study. Dynamic MRI to examine changes in the blood vessels and breast cancer following bevacizumab treatment. This test involves injecting a contrast liquid into a vein before scanning. A standard MRI scan is done before the dynamic MRI. Blood tests are done to 1) study clot formation and breakdown 2) measure levels of VEGF (a substance produced by breast cancer cells) and VCAM-1 (a substance produced by cells lining blood vessel walls) and 3) check blood counts and liver and kidney function. MUGA (a nuclear medicine scan that checks the heart's pumping ability) or echocardiogram (ultrasound scan of the heart to evaluate heart function. Blood pressure monitoring Urine tests CT scans and x-rays to evaluate disease before and after treatment. Patients will have a central venous line (plastic tube) placed into a major vein in the chest before beginning treatment. The line stays in the body during the entire treatment period and is used to give chemotherapy and other medications if needed and to draw blood samples. All treatment is given on a single day every 3 weeks. This constitutes one treatment cycle. Cycle 1 consists of bevacizumab alone; cycles 2 through 7 consist of bevacizumab with doxorubicin and docetaxel. During each cycle patients also receive injections under the skin of G-CSF a drug that raises the number of infection-fighting white blood cells which are often decreased as a side effect of chemotherapy. After cycle 7 patients may require surgery and radiation or radiation alone. After radiation treatment bevacizumab is re-started given alone every 3 weeks for an additional eight cycles. Patients whose tumors are positive for estrogen or progesterone receptors will be advised to take the drug tamoxifen or anastrozole for 5 years to decrease the chances of disease recurrence. This would begin with cycle 8.    ,NCT00016549

Breast Cancer,Effects of Raloxifene on Hormone Levels," Blood levels of the hormones estradiol and progesterone are of interest in evaluating ovarian function. However because these hormone levels vary from day to day blood samples must be taken very often or elaborately timed to specific phases of the menstrual cycle. A method has now been developed for measuring estradiol and progesterone levels in saliva. This study will test the accuracy of this method and examine whether salivary levels of these hormones change after treatment with raloxifene. Hormone levels will be measured during 3 menstrual cycles in women currently enrolled in the clinical study ""A Phase II Trial of Two Doses of Raloxifene in Women at Risk of Developing Invasive Breast Cancer."" Participants will provide a saliva sample every morning for about a month during three collection periods-1 month before beginning raloxifene treatment and 3 and 12 months after treatment starts. Patients will be given kits for collecting the samples and mailing them to the laboratory at the end of each collection period.    ",NCT00026962

Breast Cancer,High-Risk Breast Duct Epithelium, Background: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women occurring in over 230000 women annually in the United States. The vast majority of breast cancers originate in the single layer of epithelial cells that line the ductal/lobular system of the breast milk ducts. The premalignant changes which occur in the transformed epithelium are not well understood however several cytologic or histologic changes have been identified which are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer including ductal or lobular hyperplasia hyperplasia with atypia and lobular or ductal carcinoma in situ. The identification of cytological or histological abnormalities in breast epithelial cells is an important component of risk assessment. Objectives: The primary objectives are: To determine the incidence and nature of cytologic changes in ductal epithelial cells from the high risk breast in specimens collected by breast duct lavage and to determine if these cytologic findings are different from those of normal women not at increased risk for breast cancer. To characterize by breast duct endoscopy high risk breast ductal epithelium and architecture and correlate these findings with the cytologic findings from above. To determine what is the global gene expression pattern of high risk breast epithelial cells from the high risk breast and does this differ from that of breast epithelial cells from normal women not at increased risk for breast cancer. The gene expression profile will be determined by cDNA microarray and validated by RT-PCR. Eligibility: Eligibility for high risk individuals will include:   -  Women of any age with a unilateral invasive or noninvasive (DCIS) breast cancer of epithelial origin.   -  Women without breast cancer but with a Gail Index greater than 1.67% or a cumulative lifetime risk greater than or equal to double the age- and race-matched general population risk.   -  Women known to be BRCA1/2 or other hereditary genes mutation carriers.   -  Women with cytologic or histologic evidence of ductal hyperplasia atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ.   -  Women may be either premenopausal or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined by the absence of menstrual periods for at least 12 months.   -  Postmenopausal women who have previously undergone a hysterectomy without oophorectomy must have a serum FSH level of >40 IU/ml and a serum estradiol level of less than40 pg/ml to document postmenopausal status. Eligibility for normal volunteers will include:   -  Women who are premenopausal or postmenopausal with a Gail model risk index less than 1.67% and without a cumulative lifetime risk greater than or equal to double the age- and racematched general population risk.   -  Women who have previously undergone a hysterectomy without oophorectomy must have a serum FSH level of >40 IU/ml and a serum estradiol level of less than 40 pg/ml to document postmenopausal status.   -  Both breasts must be free of any suspicious areas by physical examination and for women over 30 years of age by mammogram. There must be no past history of atypical hyperplasia invasive or in situ carcinoma. Both groups must have acceptable WBC and platelet counts. Design: Breast ductal epithelial cells will be collected by breast duct lavage from a.) the breast in women at increased risk for breast cancer and b.) the breast of female normal volunteers who are not at increased risk for breast cancer. Ductal epithelial cell specimens will be analyzed cytologically for the presence of hyperplasia atypia or in situ changes. Breast duct endoscopy will be performed in breast cancer patients and in normal volunteers with cytologic atypia on ductal lavage to determine ductal architectural changes associated with increased risk for breast cancer and to provide correlation with cytologic atypia. The gene expression profile of normal and high risk ductal epithelial cells will be studied by cDNA-microarray to determine changes in gene expression associated with increased risk for breast cancer. Additional molecular profiling experiments which will be performed as lavage cells are available include DNA whole exome sequencing Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) proteomic tissue lysate arrays and identification of mammary stem cells. A total of 104 high risk subjects and 80 normal volunteers will be studied divided approximately evenly between premenopausal and postmenopausal women.    ,NCT00028340

Breast Cancer,Trastuzumab Docetaxel and Carboplatin in Treating Women With Stage II Stage III or Inflammatory Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel and carboplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving trastuzumab together with docetaxel and carboplatin may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving trastuzumab together with docetaxel and carboplatin works in treating women with stage II stage III or inflammatory breast cancer.    ,NCT00118053
Breast Cancer,Design and Feasibility of a Mediterranean Diet, Epidemiological observations indicate that a Greek-Mediterranean dietary pattern has great potential for cancer prevention but more definitive data on the preventive effects of this diet are needed. Two distinct aspects of this eating pattern are the type of fat consumed and a high fruit/vegetable intake. If the diet is feasible it could be used in future clinical trials of breast cancer prevention. In this study women randomly receive either a control diet or an intervention diet for 6 months. The intervention diet replaces half of the typical American fat intake with foods such as olive oil and nuts. The fruit and vegetable goal is 7-9 servings/day and includes several categories of fruits vegetables and herbs. Blood samples are drawn and analyzed for fatty acids derived from fats micronutrients from fruits and vegetables and markers of oxidative stress. This dietary trial will provide important data on the ability of women following typical American eating patterns to change their dietary intakes to reflect a Greek-Mediterranean pattern.    ,NCT00120016

To do this the investigators will examine gene markers in a series of breast prostate brain and lung cancer survivors who have received conformal radiotherapy between 1996 and 2003 at the Cross Cancer Institute and Tom Baker Cancer Centre.    ,NCT00122239
Breast Cancer,Bisphosphonate and Anastrozole Trial - Bone Maintenance Algorithm Assessment, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of an oral bisphosphonate (alendronate) in preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who are receiving anastrozole therapy and to determine how long alendronate treatment is needed.    ,NCT00122356
Breast Cancer,Self Hypnotic Relaxation As An Adjunct To Local Anesthesia During Large Core Breast Biopsy, Percutaneous large core image-guided breast biopsy is a well established tool in diagnosing breast cancer but the associated anxiety and pain can tax the coping mechanism of even well functioning individuals. Unabated stress during an invasive procedure not only interferes with smooth progression of the ongoing procedure but can also have deleterious effects when patients need additional procedures and dread recurrent medical traumatization. The long-term objective of this research is to provide patients with a simple coping strategy at the vulnerable time of large core biopsy in the hope that this behavioral intervention will carry over to recovery and future medical procedures. In the largest prospective randomized study of its kind the researchers showed that a self-hypnotic intervention during percutaneous image-guided vascular and renal interventions resulted in less pain and anxiety greater hemodynamic stability and fewer procedure interruptions. The positive effects of the short initial hypnotic intervention which was structured in the procedure room became more pronounced the longer the procedure lasted and carried over into the immediate post-procedure recovery. The investigators therefore challenge the current paradigms that long-lasting effects require intensive presurgical preparation.    ,NCT00122369
Breast Cancer,Frequency of Portal Images Required to Enhance Quality Assurance for Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Radiotherapy, Currently in Canada and at the Cross Cancer Institute the treatment of many women with breast cancer involves radiotherapy (RT). There is a complex process which takes place in order to plan the radiation therapy before patients commence their treatment. In many circumstances the investigators use computerized technology to assist in planning their treatment. This allows more precision in delivering the treatment to the desired areas and avoiding areas of normal tissue. Once the planning process is completed the investigators then place marks with a marker pen on the skin of the patient to outline the area where the radiation will be delivered. The investigators confirm that the correct area is being treated with an x-ray taken on the treatment unit while the patient is in the treatment position. This is called a port film or verification film. The investigators then compare this to what they set up with the computerized data. If all the information matches the patient is then treated for the full course of radiation with the assumption that all treatments are given in the correct position. No further routine checking is done. The standard at some radiotherapy centers is that the patient treatment position is verified weekly by a portal film. At the Cross Cancer Institute the investigators normally only do it once at the beginning of treatment. No information is available to confirm the necessity of doing more frequent verification films but in view of the very complex nature of the investigators' treatment delivery it may be necessary to confirm the accuracy of their treatment more often. Over the course of a 4-5 week treatment the investigators know that some patients may lose weight some become more relaxed after a few days and some have trouble with the movement in their shoulders; all of these factors influence the positioning of the patient. Measurements taken on the treatment unit often change during the course of a patient's treatment but no further verification is performed to ensure that the treated area is still what was initially intended. It is important from a quality assurance standpoint to see if more frequent checking of the radiation treatment set-up is indicated.    ,NCT00123812
Breast Cancer,Study of GPX-100 in the Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer, The purpose of this early Phase II multicenter trial is to determine the objective clinical response to GPX-100 an anthracycline similar to doxorubicin in up to 40 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer. GPX-100 is unique among anthracyclines because it is not converted to doxorubicinol during metabolism in the body. This metabolite has been shown to be a major cause of damage to the heart (cardiotoxicity) in laboratory studies. Eligible patients who are enrolled in this study will receive GPX-100 as a single agent at the beginning of as many as 8 three week long cycles of chemotherapy. Objective measurements of tumor response will be made by computed tomography (CT) scans.    ,NCT00123877
Breast Cancer,Genetic Expression and Prediction of Response to Neoadjuvant Docetaxel or Doxorubicin in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer, After a core biopsy of the tumor is obtained patients with locally advanced breast cancer are randomized to receive 4 cycles of full dose doxorubicin (75 mg/m2 e3w) or docetaxel (100 mg/m2 e3w). After the fourth cycle patients are submitted to surgery to ascertain pathological response. They then receive the opposite drug hormones Herceptin and radiation as indicated.    ,NCT00123929

Breast Cancer,XeNA Study - A Study of Xeloda (Capecitabine) in Patients With Invasive Breast Cancer, This single arm study stratified patients into two treatment cohorts based on HER2-neu overexpression/amplification. Each cohort will be independently powered for the primary endpoint. The study will evaluate the efficacy safety and impact on quality of life of treatment with oral Xeloda plus intravenous (iv) Taxotere (docetaxel). Patients with HER2-neu negative breast cancer will receive chemotherapy alone with oral Xeloda plus intravenous (iv) Taxotere (docetaxel). Patients with HER2-neu positive breast cancer will receive the same chemotherapy in combination with intravenous (iv) Herceptin (trastuzumab). Patients will receive 3-weekly cycles of treatment with Xeloda (825mg/m2 oral administration [po] twice daily (bid) on days 1-14) + Taxotere (75mg/m2 iv on day 1). HER2-neu positive patients will also receive Herceptin (loading dose of 4mg/kg iv followed by 2mg/kg iv weekly).

Breast Cancer,Pamidronate Administration in Breast Cancer Patients With Bone Metastases, The study objective is to evaluate the differences in terms of first occurrence of a skeletal event in patients with breast cancer and symptomatic bone metastases when pamidronate is administered during 2 years or when it is administered during 6 months followed by a six month rest period and again a 6 month treatment period.    ,NCT00128297
Breast Cancer,Vinorelbine Versus Gemcitabine Plus Vinorelbine in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients, The investigators assume that progression-free survival mean time for patients treated with vinorelbine will be 3 months and for patients treated with gemcitabine plus vinorelbine will be 5 months. That implies a reduction in risk ratio of 40% (Hazard ratio = 167). Assuming a bilateral alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 10% and the number of events needed if 60% of patients have progressed after 1 year the number of patients needed per treatment arm is 114. Considering a 10% post-randomization drop-out the final number of patients is 252 (126 per arm).    ,NCT00128310

Breast Cancer,Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (AC) Followed by Weekly Docetaxel as Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer Patients, Treatment consists of 4 AC cycles followed by 2 weekly docetaxel cycles (12 infusions). The pathological complete response rate obtained in previous studies is around 12%. The expected pathological complete response rate in this study is 25%. With an alpha error of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.2 and following Simon´s 2 phase test 19 patients are needed initially. With 2 pathological complete responses patient recruitment will continue until approximately 61 patients are recruited. Twelve pathological complete responses are needed to confirm the study hypothesis.    ,NCT00129376
Breast Cancer,FAC Versus FAC Plus Weekly Paclitaxel as Adjuvant Treatment of Node Negative High Risk Breast Cancer Patients, This is a prospective open-label randomized phase III trial. Patients will be stratified after breast surgery as per investigational site; menopausal status; node negative diagnosis as per sentinel-node technique versus lymphadenectomy; hormone receptor status (positive versus negative). Patients will be randomized to:   -  FAC x 6 (cycles): 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.   -  FAC x 4 (cycles) ??Taxol® x 8 (cycles): 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by 8 administrations of weekly paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 Premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors must receive tamoxifen 20 mg daily for 5 years after the end of chemotherapy. Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors are allowed to receive aromatase inhibitors as initial adjuvant hormone therapy or after tamoxifen. All patients with breast conservative surgery must receive radiotherapy. Estimated 5-year disease-free survival in the control arm (FAC x 6) is expected to be 80%. It is expected that disease-free survival will increase by 5% in the experimental arm (FAC-paclitaxel). 906 patients per arm must be recruited to detect this difference with an alpha error of 0.05 and 80% power. Assuming a 6% post-randomization drop-out rate 960 patients per arm are needed 1920 in total.    ,NCT00129389
Breast Cancer,Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Myocet/Taxotere/Herceptin for HER2 Positive Breast Cancer Patients, This is an open-label study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the combination Myocet®/Taxotere®/Herceptin® as primary treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer patients. HER2 status will be confirmed centrally by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Phase I: Initial doses will be: Myocet: 50-60 mg/m² day 1 every 3 weeks; Taxotere 60-75 mg/m² day 1 every 3 weeks; and Herceptin (4) 2 mg/kg weekly. Sample size will depend on the number of patients recruited during dose escalation. Three patients must be recruited in each dose level. If one out of three experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) 3 more patients must be recruited in the same dose level. Considering that there are 4 dose levels to be tested the estimated number of patients is 9 to 24. Patients receiving the recommended dose (RD) will be incorporated into phase II of the study. Phase II: The average pathological complete response rate reported in other trials is around 11%. The investigators expect to achieve an increase of 14% on this rate; that is they expect a pathological response rate of 25%. With a= 0.05 and β=0.2 18 patients are initially needed. If at least 3 pathological complete responses are achieved recruitment will continue to up to 53 patients. At least 10 pathological complete responses are needed to probe the hypothesis. Considering a 10% post-randomization drop-out rate a total of 59 patients must be recruited for the trial.    ,NCT00129896
Breast Cancer,Fluorouracil Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide (FEC) Versus FEC Plus Paclitaxel as Adjuvant Treatment for Node Positive Breast Cancer Patients, The efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy is limited in patients with a high risk of recurrence. Also for axillary positive node patients optimum chemotherapy regimens are still under discussion. Some previous studies suggest that in the subset of node-positive patients treatments based on sequential administration of anthracyclines and taxanes are more efficient. Paclitaxel dose-dense (weekly) administration renders an improved therapeutic index (activity/toxicity). The study is designed to compare 6 courses of FEC scheme (600/90/600) a combination of proven efficacy in node positive breast cancer patients versus 4 FEC courses followed by 8 weekly paclitaxel administrations (100mg/m2). The study hypothesis is that 5-year disease-free survival in the control arm will be 60%. The investigators expect to increase this by 8% with the experimental treatment. With an alpha error of 0.05 80% power and a post-randomization estimated drop-out rate of 10% 1250 patients are needed 625 per arm.    ,NCT00129922
Breast Cancer,EC (Epirubicin Cyclophosphamide) Followed by T (Docetaxel) Versus ET (Epirubicin Docetaxel) Followed by X (Capecitabine) as Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Node Positive Operable Breast Cancer Patients, This is a prospective randomised phase III trial to compare the efficacy and safety profiles of two types of adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for HER2 negative node positive breast cancer patients. Control Arm: This includes 4 cycles of EC 90/600 mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks followed by 4 cycles of T 100 mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks. Experimental Arm: This includes 4 cycles of ET 90/75 mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks followed by 4 cycles of capecitabine 1250 mg/m2 twice a day via oral intake for 14 days and then a one-week rest period. Premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumours must receive 5 years of tamoxifen after the end of chemotherapy. Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumours can receive tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (or both) after the end of chemotherapy. Patients may receive radiotherapy when clinically indicated. Estimation of the 5-year disease-free survival in the control arm is 72%. The experimental arm is expected to increase the 5-year disease-free survival by 7% (up to 79%). With an alpha error of 0.05 and 80% power 592 patients per arm are needed. Assuming a 17% post-randomization drop-out 691 patients per arm are needed.    ,NCT00129935
Breast Cancer,Zoledronic Acid Administration to Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With Non-Symptomatic Bone Lesions, This is an open-label randomized multicenter phase III trial to assess the efficacy of early administration of zoledronate versus observation in delaying bone-related symptoms in metastatic breast cancer patients. Patients will be randomised to receive 4 mg zoledronate every 3-4 weeks versus observation until bone-related symptoms appear or up to 12 months. One hundred twelve patients per treatment arm will be enrolled in the study. Once bone-related symptoms appear study participation is over. During the study the following will be assessed:   -  quality of life   -  performance status   -  pain rating   -  analgesic administration and   -  adverse events The principal objective is the delay in bone-related symptoms in those patients with early zoledronate administration.    ,NCT00130494
Breast Cancer,Benefit of Adding Trastuzumab to Second Line Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients Previously Treated With Trastuzumab, Eligible patients must receive vinorelbine plus capecitabine with or without trastuzumab until disease progression or unbearable toxicity. Cycles will be administered every 3 weeks. HER2 status must be locally assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All 3+ patients are eligible. In 2+ patients HER2 status must be confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Principal outcome is clinical benefit (complete + partial responses + stable disease). Sample size in each arm has been estimated with the Fleming method. Previous data show a clinical benefit rate of vinorelbine plus capecitabine around 50%. The researchers assume trastuzumab can increase it by 20%. With an alpha error of 0.05 and 80% power 37 patients per arm are needed. This is a randomised phase II trial. With a minimum expected benefit rate of 50% at least 36 patients are needed to choose with a 90% of probability to be right the best treatment arm providing it increases benefit rate at least by 15%. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10% the total number of patients needed is 82 41 per treatment arm. Patients will be stratified as per investigational site and presence of visceral metastatic lesion (liver lung pleura heart peritoneum suprarenal glands). All patients must receive 2 cycles. If no disease progression is detected treatment must continue until progression or unbearable toxicity.    ,NCT00130507
Breast Cancer,Maintenance Treatment With Capecitabine Versus Observation in Breast Cancer Patients," This is a prospective open-label randomized phase III study. Patients will be stratified as per investigational site previous adjuvant chemotherapy (anthracyclines versus anthracyclines plus taxanes) and number of affected axillary lymph nodes (0 1-3 >= 4). Node negative patients must present a tumour size > 2 cm to be eligible. At least 6 lymph nodes must be analysed to confirm the number of affected nodes. Patients will be randomised to receive: 8 courses of capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 by mouth twice a day (p.o. bid) for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest versus observation. Tissue samples must be analysed by a central laboratory to confirm estrogen receptor (ER) progesterone receptor (PgR) human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) cytokeratins CK 5/6 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status. The following data were obtained from the database of the ""El Alamo"" project. One thousand six hundred and twenty-seven (1627) in total were considered during the years 1990 to 1997. The population is formed of patients with operable breast cancer with surgery positive nodes and negative hormone receptors or negative nodes negative hormone receptors and T2-3 tumors. For these patient groups estimated 5-year disease-free survival is 64.72%. Assuming an exponential distribution the aim is to detect an increase of 64.72% to 73.7% in 5 years Disease Free survival rate corresponds to a Hazard Ratio of 0.701 and a risk reduction of about 30% with a power of 80% using a two-tailed log-rank test at 0.05 and whereas 4 years of recruitment period and 3 years of follow-up period. We would need 255 events 834 patients without considering any dropouts. Considering a drop-out rate of 5% post-randomization the final sample size will be 876 patients 438 per treatment arm. The sample size calculation was performed by the program package EAST version 5.2.    ",NCT00130533

Breast Cancer,An Investigation of the Effect of the Promoter Polymorphism in the Glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 in Patients on Breast Cancer Treatment, For many years scientists and cancer researchers have been trying to find out why some people benefit more from anti-cancer medications than other people who receive the same amount and same kind of medications. Current studies suggest that inherited characteristics might explain these differences. Height and eye color are examples of characteristics that have been inherited from parents. Studies suggest that people might also inherit genetic differences in how their bodies break down medications. When a person receives an anti-cancer medication it is broken down by the liver into smaller parts or by-products. To try to understand more about how people's bodies break down anti-cancer medications the researchers are studying the by-products (called metabolites) of epirubicin in the blood of people who are taking this medication as part of their breast cancer treatment.    ,NCT00131612

Breast Cancer,Investigating the Therapeutic Effectiveness of Aloe Barbadensis in Reducing Cutaneous Side-Effects of Radiation Treatment for Breast Cancer., Breast cancer treatment often involved radiation to the breast. A side-effect of this treatment is skin redness itching and burning. Some patients have quite severe reactions. Our current treatment for this is to avoid any soaps or other skin irritants and to use a moisturizing cream once all radiation is finished. Aloe vera is believed by many people to be useful for treatment of skin burns but this has never been proven in a randomized study. The aim of this study is to compare aloe vera gel versus plan gel versus the standard treatment to determine if there is any benefit. If there was a benefit of gel treatment over standard it could make radiation treatments more tolerable for cancer patients.    ,NCT00156806

Breast Cancer,Does Scar Massage Improve Postoperative Pain and Function in Women With Breast Cancer?, All patients undergoing breast cancer surgery are left with scars which can significantly affect their physical and psychological well being. Patients with breast cancer motivated to optimize healing and function have inquired about the advisability of scar massage after surgery. Although this is a popular technique advocated by physiotherapists and massage therapists to improve pain range of motion and scar pliability there is currently no scientific research to prove the benefits and/or risks of scar massage in breast cancer patients. We propose to study the effect of scar massage on pain arm function scar formation and quality of life in patients with breast cancer. Patients who have had breast cancer surgery and who have been referred to the BC Cancer Agency Vancouver Island Centre will be offered participation in this research study. To objectively evaluate the effects of scar massage those who agree to participate will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will be taught to perform self-massage of the scars as soon as the scars have adequately healed. The massage should be done about 10 minutes each day for a total of 6 months. The other group will not be taught self-massage and will be asked to not massage their breast scars. In both groups we will monitor pain upper body range of motion scar characteristics and quality of life using standardized criteria for 2 years from the time of surgery. Problems with infections or blood or fluid accumulation at the scar areas will also be monitored. After 2 years the information collected will be analyzed and compared to see if there are differences in pain function or quality of life between the two groups. The results from this study will provide scientific proof of whether or not scar massage after surgery is beneficial for patients with breast cancer.    ,NCT00175344

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving epirubicin together with vinorelbine works in treating patients with stage II stage III or stage IV breast cancer.    ,NCT00176488
Breast Cancer,Docetaxel Alone or in Combination With Vaccine to Treat Breast Cancer," This study will test whether giving a combination of a vaccine together with docetaxel is more effective against breast cancer than docetaxel alone. The Food and Drug Administration has approved docetaxel to treat many cancers including breast cancer. The vaccine consists of three parts: 1) a ""priming vaccine"" called PANVAC (PAN (all) VAC (vaccine)) trademark [TM]-V which is made from vaccinia virus; 2) a ""boosting vaccine"" called PANVAC[TM]-F made from fowlpox virus; and 3) sargramostim or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) a protein that may help boost the immune system. Human genes are inserted into the vaccinia and fowlpox viruses to cause production of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and mucin 1 (MUC-1)-two proteins that are often produced by cancer cells and can be used as a target for the immune system to attack the cancer. Another type of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is inserted to cause production of other proteins that enhance immune activity. Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic breast cancer (disease that has spread beyond the original site) and whose cancer produces CEA or mucin 1 (MUC-1) protein may be eligible for this study. Patients must have antigen type human leukocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2). They may have received adjuvant docetaxel treatment at least 3 months before entering this study prior hormonal therapy and up to three chemotherapy regimens. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination blood and urine tests electrocardiogram and computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups - docetaxel alone or docetaxel plus vaccine - as follows: Docetaxel Alone All patients receive docetaxel. The drug is infused through a vein over 30 to 60 minutes once a week for 3 consecutive weeks with 1 week off drug. Patients also take dexamethasone 12 hours and 1 hour before and 12 hours after the docetaxel to help prevent fluid retention (edema) that docetaxel may cause. Docetaxel Plus Vaccine Participants receive the priming vaccination followed by monthly boosting vaccinations along with the weekly docetaxel therapy. With every vaccination patients also receive an injection of sargramostim to increase the number of immune cells at the vaccination site. Sargramostim injections are given the day of vaccination and daily for the next 3 days. All vaccine and sargramostim doses are given as injections under the skin usually in the thigh. Patients are observed in the clinic for 1 hour after each injection. Patients have blood tests every four weeks to monitor drug side effects and before every vaccination to check blood counts. A bone scan or CT scan (or both) is done every 2 to 3 months to check the response to treatment. Patients may continue receiving treatment as long as their disease does not worsen and they can tolerate the treatment without significant side effects. Patients assigned to receive docetaxel alone whose disease progresses after 3 months on the drug may choose to receive the vaccine or come off the study to receive other treatment options. Patients are monitored with yearly telephone calls for up to 15 years.    ",NCT00179309

Breast Cancer,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Trastuzumab Followed By an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. An autologous stem cell transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab followed by an autologous stem cell transplant and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab followed by an autologous stem cell transplant and radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV breast cancer.    ,NCT00182793

Breast Cancer,Do Community Cancer Support Groups Reduce Physiological Stress in Women With Primary Breast Cancer?, Women with primary breast cancer may benefit from participating in supports groups as they cope with treatment and the psychological challenges of survivorship. Studies have documented that these women benefit from support groups run in a university setting; however no one has documented that they benefit from community cancer support groups. Many community cancer support groups exist and provide service to a large number of women with breast cancer. It is important to know if these groups are providing comparable service to well researched support groups. We conducted this study as the first randomized study of community compared to university-style support groups. Women had a 50/50 chance of being assigned to either a community or a university style support group based on a coin flip. This study took place in two sites The Wellness Community East Bay (Walnut Creek) and San Francisco. Two community groups were studied. i) This study evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of two community-based support group interventions for breast cancer patients [The Wellness (TWC) and Cancer Support (CSC) Communities in the San Francisco area]. We compared them with a type of therapy developed in the university setting (Stanford's Supportive-Expressive group therapy) studied which aspects are most effective and who benefits the most. We compared these women on change in emotional distress means of coping with cancer and social and family support. In addition change in physiological response to stress was measured using saliva samples. ii) We were able to achieve recruitment for 6 of 8 groups proposed. We randomized 72 women in blocks of 12 taking consecutive women per site until we accrued 12 for each group. Of those 61 women actually attended groups of those 46 women to date completed at least one follow-up and were available for analysis for this report. We screened 108 women 16 who were screened out on initial phone contact 20 women began to go through our baseline interviews and assessments and either decided not to enroll or dropped out before we could compose a group for the second S.F. randomization. Our final two follow-up assessments for our final group in the East Bay are being conducted right now (8 month) and will be conducted in October 2002 (12 month) so they are not available for assay or analysis for this final report. iii) We examined 5 outcome variables for this report and found that women participating in the community groups changed at about the same level over the 4 months of group therapy as the women in the Stanford groups. This was true for depression symptoms trauma symptoms social support self-efficacy and post-traumatic-growth. These analyses are preliminary until we complete our final follow-up assessments. It is encouraging for the community groups that women benefited at the same rate as they did in the well-researched Stanford groups. Conclusions for this study are somewhat limited because we could not complete the recruitment of our entire sample. However there is every reason to suppose that community groups are as effective at serving women with primary breast cancer as Stanford's groups though they are based on very different ideas of therapy. It is important to note that all of these groups were led by therapists and that we may have found other results if the groups had been led by peers or other types of professionals. This study reduces the human and economic cost of breast cancer in California by validating community groups usually offered free to women with breast cancer.    ,NCT00186524
Breast Cancer,Does a Peer Navigator Improve Quality of Life at Diagnosis for Women With Breast Cancer?, Women indicate the greatest needs for counseling at the time of initial diagnosis for primary breast cancer. The time of initial diagnosis is also often the time of greatest need for information for women and their families. However this is the time when a woman overwhelmed by shock and trauma is least likely to absorb information provided or seek new sources of information. An informed peer navigator with carefully trained communication skills can judge the level of information to disclose and pace that information in a way that can be easily absorbed and understood. She will also provide support. WomenCARE a well-established Santa Cruz agency providing free support services for women with cancer and the Psychosocial Treatment Lab at Stanford therefore ask whether women newly diagnosed with breast cancer will improve their quality of life by participating in a peer navigator program. WomenCARE's peer navigators provide emotional support good listening skills and information on resources for women just diagnosed with breast cancer. Having a peer counselor while a woman goes through treatment may reduce the magnitude of distress or shorten its time course. It may also reduce distress in family members and improve relationships with medical personnel. This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer navigator program where a woman newly diagnosed with breast cancer is carefully matched for 3 to 6 months after diagnosis with a trained volunteer who is herself a breast cancer survivor. Navigators and Sojourners (newly diagnosed women) are matched on things that are important to them. Women often want to be matched on the type of surgery or treatment they have received. We assign half of the women (by a process similar to a coin toss) to our peer navigator program and half to a group that receives standard medical care but no peer navigator. In this way we can compare the groups to see whether those matched with a peer navigator have better quality of life over the 3 to 6 month period. All women who join our study regardless of the group to which they are assigned get an extra consultation with a nurse specialist at a local hospital. In this consultation the nurse reviews the cancer resources available to the woman in Santa Cruz County. This meeting is tailored to the woman?s individual diagnosis and situation.    ,NCT00186602

Breast Cancer,A Study of Biweekly Pemetrexed and Gemcitabine in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, This study is designed to determine the efficacy of the biweekly pemetrexed/gemcitabine regimen when given to patients with metastatic breast cancer. Each agent has well demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In addition in the phase I combination trial of the two agents a durable tumor response was seen in one out of three heavily pretreated breast cancer patients (Adjei et al. 2000). Therefore it is reasonable to expect that the combination of pemetrexed and gemcitabine administered may be associated with considerably more anti-tumor activity than either agent alone. If such activity is seen in this study randomized studies comparing this combination with other active agents or combinations of active agents will be considered.    ,NCT00191347

Breast Cancer,Gemcitabine Combinations in Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) 1st Line, The gemcitabine-paclitaxel and gemcitabine-platinum combinations have shown promise in the treatments of MBC; however the optimal dosing schedules for these combinations have not yet been determined. The primary objective of this study is to compare the response rates of the gemcitabine-paclitaxel gemcitabine-carboplatin and gemcitabine-cisplatin combinations when administered on a biweekly schedule in metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT00191854
Breast Cancer,A Trial of Gemcitabine Combined With Vinorelbine as First Line Chemotherapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer, This is a Phase II study of gemcitabine- Vinorelbine combination in a 3-weekly schedule as first line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Eighty patients with measurable disease will be enrolled in the study. Gemcitabine will be used at 1000 mg/m2 vinorelbine at 25mg/m2. Every cycle vinorelbine will be administered before gemcitabine. After the initial dose modifications of Gemcitabine and vinorelbine doses are allowed based on patient toxicity Study therapy may continue until:   -  There is evidence of progressive disease   -  The patient experiences unacceptable toxicity.   -  The investigator decides that the patient should be discontinued   -  The patient requests discontinuation   -  The patient has received 6 cycles of the regimen(if the physician decides to continue after 6 cycles-this will be done after consultation with the sponsor)   -  Discontinuation from study therapy is indicated according to the protocol It's the investigator's responsibility to strictly stick to the protocol procedures. It needs to be discussed with Lilly medical designee in advance when any special situation occurs which has not been defined in protocol. After patients discontinue from study therapy they proceed to the post-study follow up phase of the study. Assessments to take place during this phase are outlined in the protocol.    ,NCT00192062

Breast Cancer,Weekly Gemcitabine Epirubicin and Docetaxel in Locally Advanced or Inflammatory Breast Cancer, Treatment strategies that include induction chemotherapy have several potential advantages: early initiation of systemic chemotherapy in vivo assessment of response and down-staging of both the primary tumor and regional lymphatic metastases making breast conservation an option for many. The aim of the present study is to determine the efficacy and toxicity of induction combination chemotherapy with the triplet gemcitabine epirubicin and docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer. Clearly it is in the upfront treatment as well as in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer that effective new agents and combination of agents are likely to have the greatest potential impact.    ,NCT00193050
Breast Cancer,Weekly Gemcitabine and Trastuzumab in the Treatment of Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, Due to its remarkable activity as salvage treatment in women with metastatic breast cancer as well as the additive activity observed for gemcitabine administered in combination with trastuzumab the clinical activity of the combination of gemcitabine administered with trastuzumab represents an exciting and ideal combination to further evaluate in Her 2 over-expressing metastatic breast cancer patients.    ,NCT00193063
Breast Cancer,Combination Gemcitabine Carboplatin With or Without Trastuzumab in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, Pre-clinical data suggests that combination therapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin is synergistic and both drugs may be synergistic with trastuzumab. Additionally recent clinical data suggest that the combination of gemcitabine with platinum is an active regimen in metastatic breast cancer. This study will test the combination of gemcitabine with carboplatin in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients with Her2/neu overexpression will be stratified to receive trastuzumab in addition to gemcitabine and carboplatin.    ,NCT00193076

Breast Cancer,Estrogen Priming to Increase the Efficacy of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Operable Breast Cancer, One of the basic principles of cancer chemotherapy is that these drugs act exclusively or mainly on cells in cycle. Estrogens have been shown to increase the fraction of breast cancer cells in cycle. Tamoxifen on the other hand decreases the proliferative fraction and has been shown to negatively impact on the results of adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer when given concomitantly. A number of previous studies have attempted estrogenic recruitment of cancer cells (into cell cycle) to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy in locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer. Although some studies showed an increase in response rates in the recruitment arm there was no benefit in time to progression or survival in any of the studies. These results may have been due to the inadequate sample size of the studies and advanced stage disease (with presumably higher fraction of inherently chemoresistant cells). The present study is designed to test the hypothesis that estrogenic recruitment of micrometastatic disease in operable breast cancer will increase the efficacy of standard adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. The intervention arm of the study will involve administration of short duration estrogen prior to each cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. The end-points are disease free and overall survival.    ,NCT00193726

Breast Cancer,A Study to Compare ETC vs. EC-TX and Ibandronate vs. Observation in Patients With Node-positive Primary Breast Cancer (GAIN), In the recent AGO-study a dose-dense and dose-intensified sequence of Epirubicin - Paclitaxel - Cyclophosphamide has shown superior efficacy compared to a conventionally dosed sequence of Epirubicin / Cyclophosphamid and Paclitaxel and was therefore chosen as standard treatment in this study. The experimental arm of EC-TX combines several strategies: the combination of EC will be administered every 2 weeks as a dose-dense regimen the combination of TX can also be considered as dose-dense due to the weekly application of paclitaxel. Furthermore there is clinical evidence that a combination of capecitabine and Paclitaxel provide synergistic effects with improved tumour response. A randomized phase III study could demonstrate a survival benefit of a combination of capecitabine with Docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer. This synergistic effect is probably based on the preclinical observed taxane-mediated up-regulation of thymidine phosphorylase in the tumour cell which give drive to an increased transformation of capecitabine to its active form 5-Fluorouracil. Apart from this synergy the EC-TX regimen includes now 4 highly active compounds for the treatment of breast cancer. The total doses of Epirubicin and Paclitaxel are identical in both arms. The dosage of Cyclophosphamide is lower in the experimental arm which is preferred due to the induction of leukaemia at higher doses of Cyclophosphamide. The duration of both arms with 18 and 20 weeks is nearly similar. The 2 by 2 factorial design of the trial provides the additional possibility to explore the efficacy of a bisphosphonate as another strategy to further improve the prognosis of node positive breast cancer.    ,NCT00196872

Breast Cancer,Combined Estrogen Blockade of the Breast With Exemestane and Raloxifene in Postmenopausal Women With a History of Breast Cancer Who Have No Clinical Evidence of Disease, The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effects of two drugs when they are given together. The names of the drugs are raloxifene and exemestane. Raloxifene is a drug that is related to estrogen. In the liver and bone it acts like estrogen. In the breast and uterus it acts like an anti-estrogen. It has been used in postmenopausal women to prevent a disease called osteoporosis. This is a disease that decreases bone strength over many years and may finally lead to bone fractures. In a group of women who were taking the drug it also seemed to decrease the chances of breast cancer and possibly endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterus). Therefore we want to study it further to see if it prevents breast cancer. We also want to find out if it may be even better in preventing breast cancer if it is given with another drug. The other drug in this trial is exemestane. Exemestane is a type of drug that works to decrease estrogen levels in postmenopausal women. This type of drug is used in women for the treatment of breast cancer. Before we can decide if the two drugs combined are better for preventing breast cancer we must first test these drugs together to make sure that they are safe. This safety testing is the purpose of this trial.    ,NCT00200174

Breast Cancer,Soy Protein and Breast Cancer Risk Reduction, Soy consumption has been associated with reduced risk for developing breast cancer. Ovarian hormones and breast density are considered breast cancer risk markers. We propose to test the hypothesis that consumption of soy protein reduces ovarian steroid hormones and results in a corresponding reduction in breast density.    ,NCT00204477
Breast Cancer,Soy Isoflavones and Breast Cancer Risk Reduction, Soy consumption has been associated with reduced risk for developing breast cancer. Soy contains isoflavones which are weak estrogens. The roles of soy isoflavones in reducing breast cancer risk are currently unclear. Breast density has been considered as a breast cancer risk marker. We hypothesize that because isoflavones have estrogen-like activities breast density and possibly bone density will be lower in women on soy-isoflavones.    ,NCT00204490

Breast Cancer,Extension Neoadjuvant Taxotere: Study of the Effects of Taxotere in Patients With Breast Cancer, We the investigators at Baylor Breast Care Cancer are doing this study to learn how well Taxotere makes tumors become smaller. We are also doing this study to find out how well Taxotere treats the type of breast cancer that some patients have. We are asking patients to take part in this study because they have locally advanced breast cancer. Women with this breast cancer will usually receive chemotherapy medicines to reduce or shrink the cancer before surgery to take out the cancer. If patients choose to take part in this study they will receive Taxotere and the combination of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. These medicines are part of the standard good medical care for this type of breast cancer. They are approved for the treatment of this problem. To help us learn how the patients' cancer responds to these medicines we will take a small tissue sample (biopsy) of the patients' breast cancer before beginning treatment one day after the first dose of treatment once each week for the first three weeks of treatment and when surgery is done as part of treatment for their cancer. These samples will be collected also to look at the biology of the patients' cancer. We will also use a new method called cDNA array technology which lets us look at thousands of genes (coding information inside the cancer cell) at once. By looking at different genes in the breast cancer we may learn important information about which cancers will respond to a chemotherapy medicine. We hope to learn if there are different gene patterns in patients whose tumors shrink or do not shrink with this chemotherapy medicine. This information may help us in the future to choose the right medicines for women with breast cancer so that they have the highest chance of their cancer shrinking with chemotherapy medicine. We cannot and do not know if patients will benefit if they take part in this study.    ,NCT00206453

Breast Cancer,Multi-catheter High Dose Rate (HDR) Breast Brachytherapy, Breast conservation therapy (BCT) is now widely accepted as a treatment option for most women with Stage I and II invasive breast cancer and most patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Despite superior cosmetic outcome BCT is more complex and requires a protracted treatment regimen comprised of 6 weeks of daily external beam radiation therapy to the whole breast. The purpose of this study is to determine if an acceptable outcome can be achieved with radiation delivered only to the region of the tumor bed. If this is true partial breast irradiation may lend itself to much shorter treatment times (one week) and the toxicities to adjacent normal structures (heart lung chest wall) will be greatly reduced.    ,NCT00214149
Breast Cancer,CHESS Caregivers Study: Web-based Support for Informal Caregivers in Cancer, Web-Based Support for Informal Caregivers in Cancer Brief Summary (including hypothesis): Informal caregivers need information skills and emotional support to address physical spiritual and emotional needs associated with chronic illnesses including late stage cancer. Unfortunately current conditions force clinicians to reduce their interaction time with patients and informal caregivers. Complimentary methods must be developed to provide needed information and support to caregivers. The proposed research will measure and explain the impact of two computer-based support systems that meet caregiver needs and facilitate information exchange with clinicians. The system CHESS (Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System) is a non-commercial computer system that provides patients with disease specific information emotional support and skill building tools. In the expanded form to be tested in this study CHESS with Caregiver Support (CGCHESS) will also provide the caregiver with more information support and skills training related to palliative care. CGCHESS will be further enhanced to communicate essential patient and caregiver information to clinicians prior to a scheduled clinic visit and when patient symptoms exceed a threshold. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that CGCHESS + Clinician Report (CR) will reduce caregiver burden more than CGCHESS because of the additional support caregivers and patients receive from clinicians who have access to the CHESS clinician report. Secondary analyses will study the mechanisms of the CHESS effect. Specifically the investigators anticipate that the CHESS effect on caregivers will be mediated by the CHESS effect on interaction patterns with clinicians satisfaction with clinical visits and by the CHESS effect on four patient outcomes (quality of life negative affect average severity of nine common late-stage cancers).    ,NCT00214162
Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Breast Cancer Surgical Margins Using Optical Spectroscopy, This study will apply optical spectroscopy to intraoperative margin assessment during surgery for breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,Physical Activity Promotion in Breast Cancer Survivors, Over 30 studies have shown that exercise can improve physical fitness reduce fatigue increase functioning and enhance overall quality of life (QoL) in breast cancer survivors both during and after treatments. Research has also shown however that breast cancer survivors experience a significant reduction in physical activity during treatments that is not recovered even years after treatments are completed. The objectives of this study are to examine the effects of two behavior change interventions (a step pedometer and printed materials) on physical activity social cognitive variables and QoL in a population-based sample of breast cancer survivors. Approximately 300 breast cancer survivors living in Northern Alberta will be randomized to one of four groups: (1) an exercise recommendation only group (viewed as the current standard of care) (2) an exercise recommendation plus pedometer group (3) an exercise recommendation plus printed materials group and (4) an exercise recommendation plus pedometer and printed materials group. Our primary hypothesis is that participants receiving the combined pedometer and printed materials intervention will report the greatest change in physical activity. Our secondary hypotheses are that these interventions will also result in improved QoL and more positive social cognitive beliefs about exercise in breast cancer survivors. Given the geographic dispersion of our population finding practical and sustainable interventions that employ distance medicine-based approaches may be ideal for promoting healthy activity patterns in breast cancer survivors in Northern Alberta.    ,NCT00221221

Breast Cancer,Markers for Breast Cancer, This study will analyze blood samples to identify substances that are associated with the development of breast cancer. It will determine if:   -  Women who are diagnosed with a benign breast condition that is related to a considerably increased risk of breast cancer are more likely to have certain gene variants than women diagnosed with conditions related to very little increased breast cancer risk   -  Women with benign breast conditions who subsequently develop breast cancer are more likely to have certain gene variants than women with similar benign conditions who do not develop breast cancer. This study will examine blood samples from premenopausal women who underwent breast biopsy (removal of a small piece of breast tissue for microscopic examination) at four hospitals in Grand Rapids MI from 1977 to 1987 and were found to have benign breast disease. The women who agreed to participate in a study of markers for breast cancer also provided a blood sample and were interviewed for information on their breast cancer risk factors family history of breast cancer use of medications and history of medical conditions. This study will retrieve the biopsy reports for these women determine which of them later developed breast cancer and perform genotyping on their blood samples. The information from this study may help in future diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.    ,NCT00339248
Breast Cancer,Extended Follow-up of Columbia MO Serum Bank Participants, The Columbia MO Serum Bank initially was established in 1977 as part of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Biological Markers Project to identify serum markers for breast cancer. Participants were volunteers identified through the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP) at the University of Missouri Hospital and Ellis Fischel Cancer Center in Columbia MO. A total of 6915 women without a prior history of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer donated blood to the bank on one or more occasions between 1977 and 1987. At the time of each blood collection interview information was obtained including age height weight reproductive and menstrual histories family history of breast cancer medical conditions and drug use including oral contraceptives and menopausal hormone therapy. Date of last menstrual period was captured for women who were premenopausal at the time of each blood collection. Approximately 30% of the women donated multiple samples over the first 10 years of the study (including 20% with 3 or more samples) with collections occurring on average one year apart. At each collection serum was aliquoted into up to ten 1 ml vials and stored at -70 (Infinite)C at the NCI Repository. All women gave informed consent before donating to the serum bank. The initial follow-up continued for up to 12 years through 1989 with 244 cancers identified. Of the 6915 original participants 79% were last seen in 1983 or earlier yielding a median follow-up time of 4 years. A questionnaire was mailed to all participants annually to ascertain information on interim breast biopsies and cancer diagnoses. Women who indicated that they had a breast biopsy or breast cancer were sent a consent form for permission to obtain medical records including pathology reports. For cancers at sites other than the breast medical records and pathology reports were not requested although date of diagnosis and site were ascertained. Between 1999 and 2002 an extended follow-up of Columbia MO Serum Bank participants was conducted. Of the 6915 original participants 6720 women had blood remaining and were included in this phase of the study. Of these 6154 (91.6%) were located; 566 (8%) were not locatable 109 (2%) refused to participate and 40 (<1%) were too ill to participate. 1694 women (25%) were deceased. This last follow-up identified an additional 1123 cancers. This cohort has serum samples from a cohort of 6720 pre- and postmenopausal women followed up to 20 years for cancer diagnoses and is a unique resource for molecular epidemiologic studies exploring serum markers associated with cancer risk.    ,NCT00340210
Breast Cancer,Continuation of Follow-up of DES-Exposed Cohorts, Diethylstilbestrol (DES) a drug first synthesized in 1938 was administered to several million pregnant women in the U.S. and Europe for the prevention of spontaneous abortion and premature delivery. In 1971 Herbst reported a strong association between DES use in pregnancy and the occurrence of vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) in exposed female offspring. Animal models have demonstrated a range of DES effects on offspring exposed in utero including reproductive dysfunction immune system changes behavioral and sexual abnormalities and increases in various reproductive cancers in males and females. In the mid-1970's several separate cohorts of DES-exposed daughters and unexposed comparison groups were followed for the occurrence of cancer precursor lesions and reproductive effects but systematic follow-up of these cohorts had ceased by 1990. In 1992 Congress passed a bill (H;.R. 4178) mandating the continued follow-up of DES-exposed cohorts. The National Cancer Institute in collaboration with five field centers reassembled previously studied cohorts of DES-exposed and unexposed mothers daughters and sons and identified subjects with documented exposure status who had not been studied previously through familial links within the cohorts. Standardized baseline questionnaires were mailed to cohort members to ascertain the risk of cancer and other disorders. Pathology reports were collected for reported cancers and preneoplastic conditions. Two separate rounds of follow up have been conducted and a third is almost complete. Patients from the Registry for Research on Hormonal Transplacental Carcinogenesis (the Registry) will be added to the follow-up effort in the third phase. The purpose of this study is to continue the follow-up by means of mail questionnaires and medical record collection which was begun during the first phase of the study. Concern has arisen that DES-exposed daughters may be at higher risk of breast cancer. Exposure to high levels of endogenous estrogen in utero has been hypothesized to increase the risk of breast cancer and DES is a potent estrogen. Cancer risk in the sons will also continue to be assessed especially for increased risks of prostate cancer. Since the offspring who were exposed to DES in utero are currently reaching their late forties when cancer rates begin to rise it is important to continue the follow-up of these cohorts to determine if there are long-term increases in cancer risk.    ,NCT00340600
Breast Cancer,Analysis of Data From the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study, This study will continue to analyze data collected by the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) study. The CARE study was designed to evaluate the association between reproductive factors and risk of breast cancer in white and African-American women in the United States. The present study is not recruiting additional participants. The original study enrolled 4575 women with breast cancer and 4682 control subjects between 35 and 64 years of age All participants provided a blood sample for genetic study. The samples were analyzed for variants (mutations) in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes the vitamin D receptor gene the androgen receptor gene and the insulin-like growth factor-1 gene. In addition all participants were interviewed to obtain information related to breast cancer risk including a history of reproductive menstrual oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy use; lifestyle factors such as smoking alcohol use body weight and physical activity; history of medical conditions and procedures; demographic characteristics such as age race marital status and so forth; and a detailed family history of cancer.    ,NCT00341159
Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer Breast Disease and Pesticides, This study will collect information on the height and weight of women who participated in a 1998 study in Triana Alabama on the risk of breast cancer and benign breast disease in relation to environmental exposure to the pesticide DDT and similar chemicals. This additional information is needed to calculate the participants' body mass index (BMI) which is required for completing analysis of the data. The 1998 study-a collaborative effort of the National Cancer Institute the Triana Area Medical Fund and the College of Nursing at the University of Alabama at Huntsville-investigated possible effects of DDT and other compounds on the risk of breast cancer predominantly among African-American women in the area of Triana Alabama. The study was initiated as a result of medical findings showing high blood levels of DDT among the local population who had consumed fish from a tributary of the Tennessee River that had been polluted by the discharge over several decades of large quantities of pesticides from a DDT production plant. Women participating in the study had a mammogram physical examination breast examination and blood draw and completed a questionnaire on diet and lifestyle factors. In order to complete analysis of the data and determine whether there is an association between environmental exposure to DDT and related chemicals and breast cancer risk additional information on BMI is required.    ,NCT00341315

Breast Cancer,Safety and Efficacy of Using CBUS??System for Ultrasound Breast Imaging Designed for Breast Tumor Diagnosis, In the United States breast cancer is the most common cancer occurring in women (excluding cancers of the skin) and the second most common cause of death from cancer in women (after lung cancer). Approximately 182800 new cases per year occur in the United States causing 40800 death cases per year. Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged 44-50 years. The 5-year survival rate is 60% overall but is greater than 80% for early disease. If diagnosed at an early stage breast cancer has an encouraging cure rate: up to 97% of women diagnosed with localized breast cancer will survive five years after their diagnosis. Even if the cancer is found at a more advanced stage new therapies have enabled many people with breast cancer to experience the same quality of life as before their diagnosis. Breast ultrasound (US) is an extremely useful modality in the diagnosis of breast disease in the symptomatic clinic. It is routinely used as an adjunct to x-ray mammography and clinical examination and with younger patients it may be the sole imaging modality. It has well-established value in differentiating between malignant and benign solid lesions in some cases however it cannot replace fine needle aspiration and core biopsy. Conventional breast US scanning is highly operator- dependent requiring skillful probe manipulation and the mental ability to envisage 3-D tissue structure. Acquiring 3-D US data sets may be advantageous making it easier to see and interpret 3-D structures boundaries and interactions. CBUS??Circular Breast Ultrasound Scanner is indicated to improve significantly breast images obtained by ultrasound systems. The CBUS??system automatically acquires a complete breast image and constructs a high quality 3D image of the scanned breast. These images provide diagnostic information of the complete volume of breast tissue including blood flow in a single ultrasonic 3D image. In this clinical study the CBUS??Circular Breast Ultrasound Scanner will be used to automatically image the complete breast and provides a high quality 3D image of the scanned breast.    ,NCT00355745

Breast Cancer,Partnership for Healthy Seniors, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has awarded cooperative agreements to 6 sites from across the country (Salt Lake City UT Molokai HI Houston TX Newark NJ Detroit MI and Baltimore City) to participate in a national 4-year demonstration (September 15 2006 to September 30 2010). One goal of the demonstration is to reduce disparities in cancer screening among seniors from U.S. racial and ethnic minority populations. Each site will focus on a specific racial/ethnic minority group and collaborate with CMS in project implementation. A Core questionnaire the Cancer Screening Assessment (CSA) will be administered at baseline to all participants in the demonstration. Participant identification randomization and intervention implementation will be standardized across sites. Goal: The proposal developed by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in collaboration with the Baltimore City Community Health Coalition is designed to address persistent disparities in screening for breast cervix colon/rectum and prostate cancer among Baltimore City's seniors. Primary Objective: Conduct a randomized controlled trial (target N = 2874) within a project to compare the efficacy of 2 interventions that differ in intensity to improve continuity and outcomes of care among African Americans seniors. Among African American seniors compared to a less intensive intervention (general information and educational materials) does the addition of facilitation services delivered by a health coordinator result in a greater improvement in adherence to cancer screening recommendations among those who are not known to have cancer? Study Population: We will recruit African American residents of Baltimore age 65 years or older and currently enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. (Baltimore City's 82202 seniors represent 13% of its population and account for 68% of the City's cancer deaths. Among these seniors 96% have Medicare Parts A and B 54.5% have income levels at less than 250% of the federal poverty guideline and 55.6% are African American.) Eligible participants will respond to a baseline questionnaire Cancer Screening Assessment (CSA). They will then be randomized to receive a less intensive or more intensive intervention. The less intensive group will receive general information about cancer and Medicare covered services and instructions to discuss the information with their primary care doctor. The more intensive group will receive the same information as the less intensive group receives plus tailored facilitation services delivered by a nurse-supervised community health worker. The primary outcome variable will be the difference between randomized groups in adherence to screening for breast cervix colon/rectum and prostate cancer. A community advisory committee will guide all aspects of the study and will include important stake holders (both public and private sectors) representatives from the Baltimore City Community Health Coalition the Baltimore City Department of Health the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene community leaders consumers health care providers (physicians oncologists nurse practitioners physician assistants nurses social workers pathologists) and academicians.    ,NCT00379743

Breast Cancer,Psychosocial Outcomes in Online Cancer Support Groups," Purpose: The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether psychosocial outcomes in women with breast cancer differ based on the format of online group support. This objective will be addressed by the following specific aims:   1. Specific Aim #1 is to determine if there is a difference in depressive symptoms between women with breast cancer assigned to one of two treatment conditions: moderated online support or peer-led online support. ??H1: Women with breast cancer who participate in moderated online support will report fewer depressive symptoms than women with breast cancer in peer led online support.   2. Specific Aim #2 is to determine if there is a difference in perceived social support between women with breast cancer who are assigned to one of two treatment conditions: moderated online support or peer-led online support. ??H2: Women with breast cancer who participate in moderated online support will report greater perceived social support than women with breast cancer in peer-led online support.   3. Specific Aim #3 is to determine if there is a difference in quality of life in women with breast cancer who are assigned to one of two treatment conditions: moderated online support or peer-led online support.   -  H3: Women with breast cancer who participate in moderated online support will report better quality of life than women with breast cancer in peer-led online support. NOTE: Once the study began it was obvious that we could not prevent anyone from joining a support group if that was her choice. We also could not control if participants joined a second online support group or face-to-face group during the study. Therefore we decided to omit a ""usual care"" (no support) group. The study was completed with just two groups: moderated and peer-support.    ",NCT00382785
Breast Cancer,Multivitamins do Not Improve Radiation Therapy Related Fatigue, Multivitamins (MVi) are broadly used by cancer patients to improve overall health and energy. Fatigue is a common symptom in cancer patients including those receiving radiation therapy. We conducted a trial of MVi versus placebo in patients with breast cancer (BC) undergoing radiation therapy (Rxt) to evaluate if MVi would affect fatigue and quality of life. We randomized patients at the beginning of Rxt treatment to either placebo or Centrum Silver® (Wyeth-Whitehall laboratory). At the middle of the radiation treatments patients were switched from placebo to MVi and vice versa. Patients answered to the EORTC QLQ C-30 quality of life (QOL) and Chalder Fatigue Questionnaires at the beginning the time of switching and at the end of Rxt. We found that both groups experienced significant decreases in general and physical fatigue at the end of the course of placebo compared to the assessment prior to this treatment. We also observed significant improvements in functional and symptoms in the patients on placebo. When we compared different groups of patients we also observed significantly lower rates of physical and general fatigue in the patients who had just finished a course of placebo as compared to patients finishing course of MVi. We conclude that MVi do not improve radiation related fatigue and may in fact have a deleterious effect on fatigue and decrease QOL in patients with BC undergoing Rxt.    ,NCT00383409
Breast Cancer,Spousal Relationships and Pain in Metastatic Breast Cancer, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) refers to the collection of repeated measurements of phenomena as they occur in naturalistic settings using hand-held computers. By providing an EMA of psychosocial variables that influence patient pain and pain behaviors this study seeks to characterize the pain experience in metastatic breast cancer from both patients' and spouses' perspectives.

Breast Cancer,Xenogeneic HER2/Neu DNA Immunization for Patients With Metastatic and High Risk Breast Cancer: A Phase I Study to Assess Safety and Immunogenicity, The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the injection of HER2/neu DNA is safe and stimulates an immune response. The immune system consists of different kinds of cells and substances which help fight against infections and inflammation in the body. These antibodies and T-cells are part of the immune system that may also help to fight against tumor cells. One way to make antibodies and stimulate T-cells is to inject the patient with a preparation which contains material that may stimulate the immune system. This process is called an immunization. We are trying to immunize the patient against HER2/neu. In order to participate in this trial the tumor must have a large amount of HER2/neu on its surface. The injection that the patient will receive in this trial is a piece of DNA made in bacteria which contains the gene for rat HER2. DNA is material which contains the information needed to produce many substances in the body. The HER2 gene encodes for a protein known as HER2.    ,NCT00393783

Herceptin is a new form of chemotherapy that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of breast cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the effect and safety of combining Rapamune and Herceptin on breast cancer. Rapamune and Herceptin are being combined because results from our laboratory studies suggest that the combination of the two drugs is superior to either drug used alone. Results from laboratory studies performed at other institutions suggest that adding Rapamune to Herceptin may also reverse the resistance to Herceptin. Although there has been extensive experience using Herceptin alone and Rapamune alone in human subjects the combination of Herceptin and Rapamune has not been previously evaluated. In addition we hope to better understand how these treatments work against an individual woman's tumor by analyzing tissue samples before and during treatment.    ,NCT00411788

Breast Cancer,Effect of Bazedoxifene Raloxifene and Placebo on Breast Density, It has been shown that women who have dense breasts have an increased risk of breast cancer compared with women whose breasts are less dense. However while breast density may be a risk factor the etiology of the relationship between breast cancer and breast density is not understood. Furthermore it is well recognized that breast cancer can still develop in women whose breasts are not dense. At menopause the amount of breast glandular tissue and stroma naturally decreases due to a lack of hormonal stimulation. This is characterized as a decrease in the mammographic density. Although certain medications including hormone therapy (HT) and dopamine antagonists can increase breast density these effects are reversible upon discontinuation of the specific agent. Other medications such as the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) raloxifene (RAL) and tamoxifen have been shown to not affect breast density and allow the normal age-related changes to occur. The effects of bazedoxifene (BZA) a new SERM on breast density are not known. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of BZA on breast density changes over 24 months in postmenopausal women. The results may be useful for clinicians to understand the effect of BZA on breast density and its mammographic effects. This is an observational multicenter double-blind randomized placebo- and active comparator-controlled study. It is also an ancillary that will use women who are already participants in a phase 3 trial for fracture reduction (protocol 3068A1-301-WW; primary study). In the primary study subjects received BZA 20 mg BZA 40 mg RAL 60 mg or placebo. This ancillary study will request a subset of participants to use their mammograms taken in this study. Their mammogram will be digitized by a central imaging center. A single radiologist will perform the quantifications of breast density from the digitized mammograms.    ,NCT00418236

Breast Cancer,Use of Hair to Diagnose the Presence of Breast Cancer, Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction it has been reported that a hair from an individual with breast cancer exhibits a difference in its molecular structure compared to that of an individual without breast cancer. This difference is visible in the X-ray diffraction pattern as a ring superimposed on the pattern for normal hair. The hypothesis of this study is that synchrotron x-ray diffraction can be used to differentiate hairs from women with medically diagnosed breast cancer from women not known to have the disease. To test this hypothesis hair from 2000 women attending radiology clinics for mammography will be collected analysed by x-ray diffraction and then analysed using Fermiscan proprietary image analysis software. The mammogram status of the subjects will be blinded from the diffraction analysts. Results will then be compared with mammography results to allow a direct comparison between the Fermiscan test and mammography in terms of specificity and sensitivity.    ,NCT00419900

Breast Cancer,Purged Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) From Metastatic Breast Cancer, The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the relationship of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in controlling metastatic breast cancer. The study also will investigate the role of CTCs in breast cancer.    ,NCT00429182
Breast Cancer,Randomized Trial With Trastuzumab Versus Observation in Breast Cancer Patients, Epithelial tumor cells can be detected in the bone marrow and/or the peripheral blood [disseminated and circulating tumor cells (DTCs) and (CTCs) respectively] of otherwise metastases-free patients with early breast cancer. Several studies have shown that the presence of these cells is an independent factor associated with an increased incidence of early disease relapse and disease-related death. In almost 50% of the patients adjuvant chemotherapy cannot eliminate these occult tumor cells and this is also associated with a higher probability of early relapse and death. In 60-70% of the patients DTCs and/or CTCs express the HER2/c-neu molecule and one or two administrations of their monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN) could eliminate these cells for a period ranging from 3-12 months.    ,NCT00429247
Breast Cancer,Preserving Function in Breast Cancer Patients, Breast cancer patients experience functional limitations related to the cancer and treatment side effects. Early functional limitations affect short- and long-term quality of life and may lead to long-term complications. Patients living in rural areas are at particular risk because they do not have easy access to services. Therefore early intervention is indicated to have an impact on the overall public health. Problem solving training (PST) is a standardized manual driven intervention that may be ideally suited to assist breast cancer patients to preserve their valued activities and to comply with recommended symptom management regimens (e.g. physical therapy aerobic exercise and relaxation/guided imagery) that improve function. Telephone-based PST provided from a centralized location (such as the comprehensive cancer center) may improve access and outcomes in a cost-effective manner. We propose to conduct a feasibility study of a PST intervention with 30 rural breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant treatment randomly assigned to PST or to usual care. The intervention group will receive weekly phone-based PST sessions for six consecutive weeks. The specific aims of this R03 small grant application are to:1) Test the feasibility of enrolling and retaining newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in a clinical trial to assess telephone-based PST. 2) Collect preliminary data on outcome measures of function to determine effect size estimates that will inform power analyses for a full scale randomized controlled study. Primary outcome measures will be acceptance rates for enrollment in the study retention rates across both intervention arms and satisfaction levels with the PST intervention. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at six weeks (end of PST intervention) and 3 months following baseline. The long-term goal of this line of investigation is to develop practical widely applicable rehabilitation models of care to preserve function and decrease distress in cancer patients undergoing treatment.    ,NCT00429286

Breast Cancer,Randomized Phase III Trial With Docetaxel Plus Epirubicine Versus Docetaxel Plus Capecitabine for Metastatic Breast Cancer, The combination of docetaxel+epirubicin is highly effective and well tolerated as first line treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Capecitabine is an active drug in women with MBC pretreated with taxane and anthracycline. Docetaxel increases the intracellular levels of thymidilate phosphorylase and thus is synergistic with capecitabine. The combination of docetaxel plus capecitabine is highly active and superior to docetaxel monotherapy in women with MBC pretreated with an anthracycline    ,NCT00429871

Breast Cancer,INST 0514C- Biologic Correlative Study: Trial of GW572016 in HER2 Overexpressing Breast Cancer Patients, Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become the standard of care for breast cancer patients with large tumors in order to render them operable for mastectomy or in some cases for lumpectomy and radiation therapy. Building on this theme several large hormonal therapies are extensively investigated in the neoadjuvant setting together with biologic correlates for response and resistance. As a further extension neoadjuvant therapies with biologic agents are now too being investigated for biologic evidence of efficacy before large-scale clinical trials of thousands of patients are embarked on. The neoadjuvant setting is especially attractive for these studies for several reasons including early assessment of response to therapy biopsiable access to the primary tumor and considerable reduced sample sizes compared to those required in the adjuvant setting. In addition clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a validated surrogate marker for improved survival. It may be used to test the overall efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment regimens and mirrors the effect of therapy on micrometastases setting. In a recent study good clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was the only independent variable by multivariate analysis associated with decreased risk of death. GW572016 is a new and promising dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor against HER1/2. Hundreds of patients were treated in phase I and II studies world-wide and results indicate that this reversible oral small molecule is generally well-tolerated. Studies of neoadjuvant Trastuzumab indicate that HER2 interference leads to significant tumor regression even after 3 weeks of monotherapy. We aim to extend these findings with a novel agent GW572016 that may be more effective especially from its in vitro data and to discover the true response rate to inhibiting HER1/2 signal transduction in breast cancer patients.    ,NCT00455039

Breast Cancer,Study of Biweekly Capecitabine Dosing With Bevacizumab for the Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer Based Upon the Norton-Simon Mathematical Model, The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (both good and bad) that capecitabine has on you and your breast cancer when given in a novel schedule in combination with the antibody therapy bevacizumab. Capecitabine (Xeloda®) is an anticancer drug that was approved by FDA in 1998 for treating metastatic breast cancer. Capecitabine is a pill that blocks the way cancer cells multiply and grow. Usually this medicine is taken twice a day for fourteen days in a row. Patients then get a break from the drug for seven days. With this schedule and usual dose some patients on capecitabine have experienced side effects that interfered with their daily comfort.Different doses and schedules of capecitabine have been studied in animal studies and in people with colon cancer. Mathematic modeling has been used to better understand these results.Information from these experiments leads us to ask if 7 days of treatment with capecitabine followed by a 7-day break is both safer and more active against breast cancer. The study you are considering is a first step in this direction and is designed to demonstrate both safety and activity. Bevacizumab is a biologic therapy that targets the growth of blood vessels which tumors need to grow. Women whose breast cancer spread to other parts of their bodies lived longer without their cancers growing when they were treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. Bevacizumab was tested with the 14-day/7-day schedule of capecitabine. These two medicines are safe when given together and seem to work better against breast cancer than capecitabine alone. This study is designed to answer the questions:   1. What are the side effects of bevacizumab and capecitabine when given in this different schedule and how often do they occur?   2. When given in this schedule does capecitabine with bevacizumab help treat breast cancer that has spread or continues to grow despite being treated by other chemotherapy drugs before?    ,NCT00468585

Breast Cancer,Phase I Oral mTOR Inhibitor RAD001 in Combo w/ Capecitabine for Metastatic Breast, In order to improve the survival of metastatic breast patients it is important to investigate the use of novel therapeutic agents combined with known active agents in the treatment of breast cancer. This is a phase I study evaluating the maximum tolerated doses and toxicities of RAD001 in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. RAD001 (INN: everolimus) is a novel macrolide which is being developed as an antiproliferative drug with applications as an immunosuppressant and anticancer agent. Phase I trials in patients with solid tumors have shown that treatment with RAD001 is well-tolerated with a minimal side effect profile. Capecitabine (Xeloda Roche) is an oral fluoropyrimidine that was approved in 1998 for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The all-oral regimen of RAD001 with capecitabine is an attractive approach as the treatment of metastatic breast cancer has not yet proven to be curative. We also want to find out what possible benefit this combination of drugs might have on treating your cancer.    ,NCT00473005

Breast Cancer,Effect of Increased Light Exposure on Fatigue in Breast Cancer," Patients treated with chemotherapy complain of poor sleep fatigue and depression. In addition chemotherapy disrupts the body's internal ""biological clock"" which may make sleep fatigue and depression all worse. Women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy are not exposed to much bright light and this may also contribute to the disruption of their body clock because bright light is necessary for a strong biological clock. One of the easiest ways to strengthen the biological clock is by increasing bright light exposure. The correct timing of the light exposure will help the women feel more alert during the day.

Breast Cancer,Phase II Study With Abraxane Bevacizumab and Carboplatin in Triple Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer, Taxanes (such as paclitaxel) are highly active to treat breast cancer. Abraxane® (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) compared to standard paclitaxel improves efficacy and tolerability. When combined with a taxane platinum agents improve response in metastatic breast cancer with carboplatin conferring less toxicity than cisplatin. Monoclonal antibodies including bevacizumab target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to reduce angiogenesis. We hypothesize that the previously-untested combination of weekly Abraxane® and carboplatin plus biweekly bevacizumab will lengthen time to progression without producing intolerable toxicity.    ,NCT00479674

Breast Cancer,A Prospective Single-Arm Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Zoladex 3.6mg Combined With CEF Chemotherapy as Neo-Adjuvant Therapy in Hormone Responsive Premenopausal Operable Breast Cancer, It has been found that many breast cancers are hormone dependent and that hormonal therapy by estrogen suppression such as ovarian ablation tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor has proven beneficial in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Zoladex a kind of luitinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue can offer efficient estrogen suppression as well. It can induce reversible amenorrhea and the clinical effect is similar to ovarian ablation. Some studies have demonstrated the efficacy of zoladex in treating pre and perimenopausal hormone dependent breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. Few data is available on Zoladex in neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer In our departments neoadjuvant CEF regimen is of general practice and a preliminary study is designed to investigate whether adding Zoladex into neoadjuvant CEF could further improve results in hormone responsive breast cancer.    ,NCT00488722

Breast Cancer,Pre-Surgical Qigong Therapy for Women With Breast Cancer, The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the United States has increased dramatically in the past 10 years. Nowhere is this trend more apparent than when one examines CAM use by patients diagnosed with cancer. As with the general population patients with cancer typically use CAM-based modalities alongside their conventional cancer treatments. Patients are often seeking a holistic approach to managing and preventing disease. Although most patients will combine alternative approaches with conventional medicine some patients do in fact decline curative conventional treatments in favor of more non-toxic alternative approaches. One such approach that patients combine with conventional medicine or use in place of conventional medicine is qigong. Qigong is a bioenergy therapy with a long history of therapeutic use for many diseases including cancer. Preliminary experiments and a review of the literature show that qigong might improve the outcome for cancer patients. However none of this research has been confirmed in the peer-reviewed Western scientific literature. Although it is unlikely that EQT will result in significant decreases in tumor size patients are using qigong either as a complementary approach and sometimes even in place of conventional medicine it is therefore important for us to determine whether there is any merit to this treatment modality. The goal of this pilot trial is to examine one form of medical qigong (external qi therapy (EQT)) to determine feasibility. In an exploratory nature we will also examine any changes in tumor size in women with breast cancer who are awaiting surgery.    ,NCT00495209
Breast Cancer,Prophylactic Irradiation to the Contralateral Breast for BRCA Mutation Carriers Undergoing Treatment for Breast Cancer, Women with BRCA germline mutations face a very high risk of developing breast cancer during their lives. It was shown that for carrier patients breast conservation comprising of lumpectomy followed by whole breast radiation was not associated with increased risk of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence as compared with non carriers (10-15% over 10 years) especially if they also underwent prophylactic oophorectomy. Yet their risk of subsequent contralateral breast cancer was significantly increased reported as high as 25-30% over 10 years and 40% over 15 years as compared to 3% and 7% respectively in non carriers. The reduction in ipsilateral disease was attributed to radiation of the affected breast. We propose that for breast cancer patients with BRCA germline mutation that choose to have breast-conserving therapy and refuse prophylactic contralateral mastectomy prophylactic radiation to the contralateral breast may reduce the rate of subsequent contralateral breast cancer and offer an option for risk reduction.    ,NCT00496288
Breast Cancer,Capecitabine (Xeloda) and Lapatinib (Tykerb) as First-line Therapy in HER2/Neu-positive Breast Cancer," Subjects with advanced or metastatic (spread to other parts of the body) breast cancer that is HER2/neu-positive will take part in this study. This type of breast cancer has a high amount of a protein called HER2. HER2 is part of a family of receptors found on both cancer and normal cells. This family of receptors is important for cell growth and is found in many tumor types. The purpose of this research study is to compare an approved treatment for breast cancer capecitabine also called Xeloda® to the combination of capecitabine plus an experimental drug lapatinib also known as Tykerb® for treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is HER2/neu-positive.Capecitabine is an approved type of chemotherapy used to treat certain cancers including breast cancer. Capecitabine fights cancer by interfering with the ability of cells to divide and tumor growth. Lapatinib (Tykerb®) is considered ""investigational"" which means the drug has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sale as a prescription or over-the-counter medication. Lapatinib may slow or stop cancer cells from growing by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. However this theory has not been proven. The addition of the study drug (lapatinib) to capecitabine may help stop cancer cells as well as or better than capecitabine alone. Other studies have demonstrated activity and tolerability of lapatinib either alone or in combination with capecitabine in the treatment of breast cancer.Subjects will receive capecitabine and lapatinib. A treatment period will be 21 days long. This period is known as a ""cycle"". All medications will be given by mouth. Subjects will take capecitabine for 2 weeks straight (Day 1-14) followed by a 1 week without capecitabine (Day 15-21). Doses of lapatinib will be taken daily continuously for 21 days (Day 1-Day 21) which means that subjects will still take lapatinib on the week that they do not take capecitabine (Day 15-21). Subjects will continue to receive these medications unless they experience severe serious and/or excessive side effects the cancer becomes worse the subjects wishes to no longer participate or the study doctor feels it is not in the best interest to continue treatment.Tests and procedures such as physical exam blood tests CT or MRI ECG ECHO and/or MUGA tests will be conducted at one or more of the following time points: before the study starts before each cycle every 6 and 12 weeks and after the last dose of capecitabine/lapatinib treatment.

Breast Cancer,ZK219477 (Sagopilone) in Patients With Breast Cancer and Brain Metastases," The purpose of this research study is to determine the effects (good and bad) of ZK219477(sagopilone) on participants and their cancer. ZK219477 is a chemotherapy drug that is thought to work by interfering with the ability of cancer cells to grow and divide. It is a part of a group of drugs called ""epothilones"" which appear to cause shrinkage of cancer in some patients with breast cancer. It is generally difficult for chemotherapy to enter the brain. However it is believed that ZK219477 crosses into the brain. We are also studying whether an investigational MRI scan procedure may eventually help to predict which patients will benefit from ZK219477.    ",NCT00496379
Breast Cancer,Chemotherapy-Induced Changes to Cognition and DNA in Breast Cancer Survivors, The purpose of this study is to learn more about how chemotherapy affects an individual's thinking abilities (cognition). Some research has shown that chemotherapy can cause changes in cognition in breast cancer survivors. However it is not clear why this change occurs. In this study the investigators will look to see if damage to DNA is related to these changes in cognition. Specifically the investigators want to see 1) if women who have been treated with chemotherapy have more DNA damage than healthy women; and 2) if DNA damage is related to cognitive problems in breast cancer survivors and healthy women.    ,NCT00496613
Breast Cancer,Trial of Patient Navigation-Activation, The University of Rochester Department of Family Medicine funded by the National Cancer Institute will train community health workers to guide patients through the cancer care system. The project will help to teach patients how to communicate more effectively with their health care team in order to understand the treatment options available to them. Although not widely available it is believed patient navigation programs are beneficial. This research study will evaluate how well this tool works especially among those who experience disparities in health care. The goal is to determine if having a trained navigator shortens the time between an abnormal test result and a definitive diagnosis and between a definitive diagnosis and completion of treatment for breast and colorectal cancer patients. The project also will evaluate whether navigation improves the ability to communicate with the doctor patient satisfaction with care and quality of life.    ,NCT00496678

Patients receive 4 Gy twice a day for 4 days (total dose 32 Gy).    ,NCT00499057
Breast Cancer,Paclitaxel Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin Followed by Autologous Dendritic Cells and Surgery With or Without Radiation Therapy and/or Hormone Therapy in Treating Women With Stage II or Stage III Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Injecting the patient's dendritic cells directly into the tumor may stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy together with autologous dendritic cells before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving radiation therapy and hormone therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving paclitaxel together with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin followed by autologous dendritic cells and surgery with or without radiation therapy and/or hormone therapy works in treating women with stage II or stage III breast cancer.    ,NCT00499083

Patients with breast cancer who are undergoing radiotherapy will be randomly assigned to either a yoga group (YG) or a stretching (ST) control group or a waitlist control (WL) group. Participants in YG and ST groups will attend three sessions each week throughout their 6-week radiotherapy schedule. The sessions will be coordinated with the treatment schedule and conducted adjacent to the treatment facility. Measures will be obtained prior to randomization a brief assessment during the middle of radiation therapy during the last week of radiation therapy and 1 3 and 6 months after the last radiation session. With the inclusion of two control groups in this randomized trial researchers will attempt to validate the benefits of yoga as an adjuvant to radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer wherein researchers will control for specific components of the yoga program and also examine some of the mechanisms that are necessary for the program to be effective. Our specific aims in the proposed study are to:   -  Conduct an initial evaluation of whether participation in the yoga program improves patients' fatigue and sleep disturbances. Fatigue and sleep will be assessed with self-report measures and the use of actigraphy for a more objective measure of sleep quality.   -  Secondary end points will include examining QOL mental health and objective physiological outcomes (blood samples for immune measures saliva samples for cortisol levels and heart rate variability).   -  Exploratory analyses will examine some plausible mediators of the yoga program including cognitive processing spirituality and finding meaning in the cancer experience.    ,NCT00508794
Breast Cancer,Cancer Prevention and Treatment Among African American Older Adults: Treatment Trial, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has awarded cooperative agreements to 6 sites from across the country (Salt Lake City UT Molokai HI Houston TX Newark NJ Detroit MI and Baltimore City) to participate in a national 4-year demonstration (September 15 2006 to September 30 2010). One goal of the demonstration is to reduce disparities in cancer treatment among seniors from U.S. racial and ethnic minority populations. Each site will focus on a specific racial/ethnic minority group and collaborate with CMS in project implementation. A Core questionnaire the Cancer Screening Assessment (CSA) will be administered at baseline to all participants in the demonstration. Participant identification randomization and intervention implementation will be standardized across sites. Goal: The proposal developed by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in collaboration with the Baltimore City Community Health Coalition is designed to address persistent disparities in breast cervix colon/rectum prostate and lung cancer treatment. Primary Objective: Conduct A CONTROL RANDOMIZED TRIAL within a randomized control demonstration project (N = 200) to compare the efficacy of 2 interventions that differ in intensity to improve continuity and outcomes of care among African Americans seniors. Among African American seniors compared to a less intensive intervention (general information and educational materials) does the addition of facilitation services delivered by a health coordinator result in a greater improvement in adherence to recommended treatment among those diagnosed with breast cervix colon/rectum prostate or lung cancer? Study Population: We will recruit African Americans age 65 years or older and currently enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. (Baltimore City's 82202 seniors represent 13% of its population and account for 68% of the City's cancer deaths. Among these seniors 96% have Medicare Parts A and B 54.5% have income levels at less than 250% of the federal poverty guideline and 55.6% are African American.) The trial consists of individuals diagnosed with breast cervical colorectal prostate or lung cancer. Eligible participants will respond to a baseline questionnaire the Cancer Screening Assessment (CSA). They will then be randomized to receive a less intensive or more intensive intervention. The less intensive group will receive general information about cancer and Medicare covered services and instructions to discuss the information with their primary care doctor. The more intensive group will receive the same information as the less intensive group receives plus tailored facilitation services delivered by a nurse-supervised community health worker. The primary outcome variable for the trial will be the difference between randomized groups in adherence to treatment for breast cervix colon/rectum prostate and lung cancer. A community advisory committee will guide all aspects of the study and will include important stake holders (both public and private sectors) representatives from the Baltimore City Community Health Coalition the Baltimore City Department of Health the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene community leaders consumers health care providers (physicians oncologists nurse practitioners physician assistants nurses social workers pathologists) and academicians.    ,NCT00509444

Breast Cancer,Sleep Circadian Hormonal Dysregulation and Breast Cancer Survival, Recent research provides evidence that disrupted circadian rhythms including hormonal patterns and sleep are associated with increased risk of breast cancer incidence and faster progression to mortality. We have observed that a loss of normal diurnal cortisol rhythm associated with more awakenings during the night predicts early mortality with metastatic breast cancer. Other recent studies have shown that nighttime shift work is associated with higher breast cancer incidence and in a murine model disrupting circadian cortisol cycles produced a doubling of implanted tumor growth. There is also recent evidence that abnormal clock genes are associated with cancer. However it is not clear whether sleep disruption per se affects breast cancer progression or whether such an effect is mediated by hormonal and immune dysregulation of this prevalent and hormone-mediated cancer. We propose to study sleep disruption as a prognostic factor in the progression of metastatic breast cancer. We will also examine sleep patterns in association with disrupted circadian rhythms of cortisol ACTH and melatonin as well as measures of immune function known to be salient to breast cancer progression. These are natural killer cell cytoxicity and specific cytokine IL-6. We plan to recruit 105 women 45 years through 75 years with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer and 20 age and SES-matched controls for a two-week at home sleep study with Actiwatch and two nights of in-home EEG monitoring followed by 28 hours of continuous blood sampling and one night of EEG sleep monitoring in our lab at Stanford. This will provide a full examination of circadian hormones associated with sleep patterns. We will relate these assessments to the subsequent course of breast cancer progression. Results of this study will provide specific evidence regarding how improved sleep management may affect the course of breast cancer. Aim 1: To study 24-hr diurnal rhythms of HPA axis hormones and melatonin in women with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer. Hypothesis 1: Women with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer will have reduced amplitude and disrupted phase of 24-hr diurnal rhythms of cortisol ACTH and melatonin. Aim 2: To describe sleep disruption in women with metastatic breast cancer and examine psychosocial endocrine and immune factors that may be associated with sleep disruption. Hypothesis 2: Women with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer will have a higher incidence of both at home and laboratory-examined sleep disruption than control women without breast cancer. Hypothesis 3: Poorer sleep quality will be associated with more pain more emotional suppression in response to stressors less emotional support greater depression and anxiety and greater perceived and traumatic stress. Hypothesis 4: Poorer sleep quality and quantity of sleep and daytime sleepiness and fatigue will be associated with abnormal circadian neuroendocrine (i.e. cortisol ACTH and melatonin) and immune patterns (i.e. suppressed day and night time NK activity and loss of NK rhythms; increased day time IL-6 levels and /or loss of IL-6 rhythm). Aim 3: To study the relationship between sleep disruption and survival time among metastatic and recurrent breast cancer patients. Hypothesis 5: Poorer sleep quality and quantity of sleep will predict shorter survival. Hypothesis 6: Reduced diurnal amplitude and an abnormal phase of cortisol will predict shorter survival. Explanatory Aim 4: To investigate whether sleep disruption mediates the relation of psychosocial factors to health outcomes.    ,NCT00519168

Breast Cancer,Cancer Genetics CD-ROM for Hispanics, This project will build upon prior successful research on the effectiveness of an interactive computer disk with readable only memory (CD-ROM) for educating women about breast cancer and genetic risk. Prior studies found that an interactive CD-ROM for educating women about breast cancer risk and genetic testing was effective. The program was well received by lay persons and professionals. In a randomized controlled trial conducted at multiple sites the CD-ROM intervention was highly effective in increasing knowledge especially among women at low risk of carrying a breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) mutation. Researchers now propose to expand the use of the interactive CD-ROM in two innovative ways. The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the program as a first-line educational approach for Hispanic women on the Texas-Mexico border where educational resources about cancer genetics are limited. First researchers will modify and adapt the program for a primarily Hispanic population in order to make it culturally and linguistically appropriate to the needs of that audience. Second researchers will evaluate the program as a first-line educational method among women with a personal or family history of breast cancer. Researchers will compare the effectiveness of the CD-ROM when implemented with and without the guidance of a trained promotora and in comparison with standard educational materials (usual care condition). The specific aims of this study include: Aim 1: To modify the interactive CD-ROM to: a) make it culturally and linguistically appropriate for Hispanic women residing along the Texas-Mexico border; b) reflect current knowledge about breast cancer genetics; c) add a module to help women prepare to discuss their family history and cancer risk with a health care provider (n=50 participants). Aim 2: To conduct a randomized controlled evaluation that compares the efficacy of the modified CD-ROM when used alone vs. when used with a promotora-assisted approach vs. standard written materials (n=414 participants).    ,NCT00525980

Breast Cancer,Trastuzumab or Observation After Combination Chemotherapy and Trastuzumab in Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery for Stage II or Stage III Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving combination chemotherapy together with trastuzumab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving trastuzumab after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. Sometimes after surgery the tumor may not need more treatment until it progresses. In this case observation may be sufficient. It is not yet known whether trastuzumab is more effective than observation when given after combination chemotherapy and trastuzumab in treating patients with breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,Dyadic Coping in Breast and Prostate Cancer Patients and Their Spouses, The purpose of this study is to focus on dyadic coping as one of the main factors that enhance resilience in adjustment to cancer while also assessing other protective factors for coping with traumatic events. Specifically the study aims are:   1. To assess the level of post traumatic distress functional impairment and depression among breast and prostate cancer patients and their spouses.   2. To assess resiliency factors such as flexibility self efficacy and ego resilience among breast and prostate cancer patients and their spouses.   3. To examine the pattern of dyadic coping at 3 time points: at the beginning and end of radiation therapy and at six-week follow-up.   4. To examine the relationships between dyadic coping and level of posttraumatic distress and the resilience factors over time (in 3 repeated measures) Different aspects of coping with the trauma of cancer and its treatment may be assessed. Measures of strength and distress amongst patients and their spouses may enable a fuller picture of what types of responses exist which interventions may be most beneficial and what other factors may relate to positive coping increased resilience and quality of life such as flexibility and the nature of the couples' dyadic coping.    ,NCT00536055
Breast Cancer,Various G-CSF Regimens to Prevent Infection During Chemotherapy, The purpose of this study is to prevent chemotherapy-related febrile neutropenia prophylaxis with antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) have proven efficacious [1-3]. G-CSF has only few side effects but is expensive. In 2006 updated G-CSF guidelines conclude that primary G-CSF prophylaxis has clinical benefits for and should be offered to patients at a more than 20% risk of febrile neutropenia. Based on many positive and few negative trials one can consider the use of taxanes as standard of care in the adjuvant setting in node-positive breast cancer. Taxanes (with or without anthracyclines) have an increased risk for febrile neutropenia. The updated guidelines and changes in daily clinical practice will have a significant impact on the investigators health care resources. There is a higher risk of febrile neutropenia for the first chemotherapy cycle compared to subsequent cycles in small cell lung cancer patients. Also in advanced breast cancer the majority of first observed episodes of febrile neutropenia occur in the initial chemotherapy cycles Irrespective of tumour type or chemotherapy regimen the risk of febrile neutropenia is highest during the first two cycles of chemotherapy. Thereafter the risk rapidly declines and the benefit of G-CSF largely seems to disappear. So in order to improve the cost-effective administration of primary G-CSF prophylaxis it is justified to assess whether G-CSF prophylaxis can be limited to the first two chemotherapy cycles as compared to the current practice of continuous G-CSF prophylaxis.    ,NCT00536081

Breast Cancer,Predicting Response and Toxicity in Patients Receiving Paclitaxel and Avastin for Breast Cancer, This trial provides a unique opportunity in that it combines genomic proteomic and pharmacogenomic assessments in patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer. To date no other trials have analyzed gene and protein expression at the same time points in the same patient combined with clinical outcome. Similar to previous attempts to predict response based on expression of a single gene or protein we expect that neither genomic or proteomic profiling alone will be sufficient to optimize therapy. Rather we expect an iterative process that combines information gleaned from both platforms modified to avoid toxicity based on pharmacogenomics.    ,NCT00537173

Breast Cancer,"""The Efficacy of 'Radioguided Occult Lesion Localization' (ROLL) Versus 'Wire-guided Localization' (WGL) in Breast Conserving Surgery for Non-palpable Breast Cancer: a Randomized Clinical Trial""", Rationale: Approximately 25% of breast cancers detected are non palpable. Accordingly a localization technique is required to help the surgeon to find and remove the cancer. The current technique (wire guided localization [WGL]) is difficult to perform and has a high rate of tumour positive margins in the resected specimen requiring a second operation. A new approach in the localization and resection of non-palpable malignant breast lesions is 'radio guided occult lesion localization' (ROLL). ROLL was introduced as a possible replacement for WGL at the `European Institute of Oncology' in Milan in 1996. This technique utilizes the intratumourally injected radiotracer that is generally used for the lymphatic mapping and SNB to localize the primary tumour guided by the gamma probe. Five studies so far have proven the applicability of this method. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of Radio Occult Lesion Localisation (ROLL) versus Wire guided Localisation (WGL) in breast conserving surgery for non-palpable breast cancer Study design: A multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients with proven non-palpable breast cancer will be randomized for either ROLL or WGL. Study population: 316 women with a core biopsy proven non palpable cT1 breast carcinoma that are eligible for a breast conserving treatment and sentinel node biopsy (SNB). Intervention (if applicable): Patients in the WGL group will undergo intra tumoural injection of a nuclear radiotracer under stereotactic or ultrasonographic guidance. After scintigraphic imaging to monitor the migration of the radiotracer a guide wire will be inserted under stereotactic or ultrasonographic guidance. The excision of the primary tumour is guided by the inserted wire and the sentinel node procedure is performed using a gamma probe and intratumoural injection of patent blue. Patients in the ROLL group will undergo the same procedure except for the guide wire insertion. The excision of the primary tumour is guided by the gamma probe. Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary study endpoints; ROLL vs WGL:   1. The percentage of tumour-free margins (invasive and in situ)   2. The volume and maximum diameter of the lumpectomy Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation benefit and group relatedness: There is no pre- per- or post operative extra burden. The radiofarmacon is already used in the standard care of breast cancer patients for the sentinel node biopsy. The used radio-active substance does not damage the patient. A specific burden questionnaire aimed at evaluating the burden of the cosmetic result will be administered. To further assess the net impact in terms of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) also the EQ5D will be obtained at T = 0 6 12 and 26 weeks after the initial diagnostic work-up. Should the results indicate that overall the WGL procedure lead to better clinical outcome a cost-effectiveness analysis is foreseen using bootstrapping to assess the uncertainty with regard to the balance between costs and effects. All analyses will be limited to a half year time horizon. Accordingly discounting of costs or effects is not applicable.    ,NCT00539474
Breast Cancer,A Phase 2 Trial of Standard Chemotherapy With or Without BSI-201 in Patients With Triple Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer, The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine whether combining iniparib (BSI-201) with standard chemotherapy in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative progesterone receptor (PR)-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative metastatic breast cancer patients improve clinical benefit compared to treatment with standard chemotherapy alone. Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi it was concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.    ,NCT00540358

Breast Cancer,Study of Anastrozole Letrozole or Exemestane With or Without Tamoxifen in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Hormone-Responsive Breast Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed By Surgery, RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Anastrozole letrozole and exemestane may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. It is not yet known whether giving tamoxifen followed by anastrozole letrozole or exemestane is more effective than giving anastrozole letrozole or exemestane alone in treating breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving tamoxifen followed by either anastrozole letrozole or exemestane to see how well it works compared to anastrozole letrozole or exemestane alone in treating postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive invasive breast cancer that has been completely removed by surgery.    ,NCT00541086

Breast Cancer,Bevacizumab + Endocrine Treatment vs Endocrine Treatment as First Line Treatment in Postmenopausal Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer, Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with negative HER2 who are candidates for hormone treatment and who have not received previous chemotherapy or hormonotherapy for the metastatic disease. The main endpoint of the study is PFS. It has been calculated that 378 patients will need to be included according to the following assumptions:   -  Recruitment period of 21 months.   -  Minimum follow-up period of 9 months.   -  PFS of 9 months in the control arm (letrozole in monotherapy). Using a two-sided log-rank test for a 5% α level 344 patients (172 in each treatment arm) will be required for 270 events to occur which will provide an 80% power for detecting a hazard ratio of 0.69 (corresponding to a PFS median of 13 months in the bevacizumab arm). This sample size has been adjusted for an intermediate analysis when 2/3 of the total of required events have occurred. This intermediate analysis can be avoided if at the time in which it must be carried out it is estimated that the final analysis will be carried out in 4 months. Taking into account a 10% percentage of losses 378 patients are expected to be included in the study. An intermediate safety evaluation will be carried out when 63 patients have finished their treatment in each treatment arm.    ,NCT00545077

Breast Cancer,Preoperative Dose-dense Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide Followed by Paclitaxel With Bevacizumab in Operable Breast Cancer, Dose dense chemotherapy which is the term for Adriamycin and Cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by Taxol chemotherapy given every two weeks is the standard chemotherapy for the treatment of ER+ or PR+ breast cancer. In this trial the standard chemotherapy is being combined with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is an antibody which works differently from the way other chemotherapy drugs work. Bevacizumab slows or stops cell growth in cancerous tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors by binding to a substance found on cancer cells called VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). Bevacizumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of colorectal cancer and lung cancer. However it is not approved for the treatment of breast cancer. Another goal of this research is to determine whether we can develop a way to identify tumors that will respond well to this study treatment.    ,NCT00546156

Breast Cancer,Lapatinib and Trastuzumab With or Without Endocrine Therapy," We think that lapatinib will help to shrink your tumor when given prior to the main or primary therapy for the kind of breast cancer you have been diagnosed with. When treatment is given before the main or primary therapy it is called neoadjuvant therapy. We will compare lapatinib with lapatinib plus trastuzumab (herceptin) for 12 weeks. If your tumor is estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) estrogen deprivation will also be given to you. Tumors that are ER positive have a lot of estrogen receptors found in them. This is also called ""over expression"" or amplification of estrogen receptors. The most important information we will get from this study is to see the response to ""neoadjuvant"" (treatment given before the main treatment) lapatinib with trastuzumab (herceptin) in your tumor tissue sample.

Breast Cancer,The Active After Cancer Trial (AACT), This study is being done to determine whether a telephone-based counseling intervention can help survivors of breast and colorectal cancer increase their weekly physical activity. Observational evidence suggests that physical activity after breast and colorectal cancer diagnosis decreases recurrence rates. Unfortunately many people become less active during cancer therapy and a substantial proportion never return to pre-diagnosis levels of physical activity. This study looks to see if people who have recently finished chemotherapy for breast colon or rectal cancer can be motivated to increase their exercise by talking to an exercise specialist over the phone. The study also looks at changes in mood fatigue fitness fat distribution and weight.    ,NCT00548236

Breast Cancer,Intermittent Letrozole Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer, The purpose of this research study is to study the effects of using aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy intermittently on participants with breast cancer. AIs are a class of drugs used to treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women. They work by decreasing the level of estrogen which is believed to stimulate the growth of tumor tissue. Breast cancer that progresses despite therapy with an AI is thought to have become resistant to AI therapy. There is scientific evidence to suggest that resistant breast cancer cells learn to grow at the very low levels of estrogen present on AI therapy and that increasing estrogen levels even slightly by stopping AI therapy may inhibit the breast cancer cells.    ,NCT00549822
Breast Cancer,Cognitive Changes Associated With Breast Cancer Treatment," Patients with cancer often complain that their ""mind does not seem to be clear."" This can be due to stress depression anxiety or physical problems caused by cancer or the treatments used to control symptoms. There are many purposes for this study; one of them is to learn about the effects of cancer treatments on the brain and another is to identify useful tools to detect these effects. The results of this study may stimulate new research comparing different treatments to the current treatment so the researchers may learn how to treat symptoms more effectively and improve patient quality of life. We would also like to learn more about the effects chemotherapy may have on DNA.    ",NCT00550134

Breast Cancer,Letrozole in Preventing Cancer in Postmenopausal Women Who Have Received 4-6 Years of Hormone Therapy for Hormone Receptor-Positive Lymph Node-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Letrozole may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. It is not yet known which regimen of letrozole is more effective in postmenopausal women who have received hormone therapy for early-stage breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing two different regimens of letrozole in preventing cancer in postmenopausal women who have received 4-6 years of hormone therapy for hormone receptor-positive lymph node-positive early-stage breast cancer.    ,NCT00553410
Breast Cancer,Cyclophosphamide Radiation Therapy and Poly ICLC in Treating Patients With Unresectable Recurrent Primary or Metastatic Liver Cancer, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Poly ICLC may stop the growth of liver cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving the drug directly into the arteries around the tumor may kill more tumor cells. Giving cyclophosphamide and radiation therapy together with poly ICLC may be an effective treatment for liver cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving cyclophosphamide radiation therapy and poly ICLC together and to see how well they work in treating patients with unresectable recurrent primary or metastatic liver cancer.    ,NCT00553683
Breast Cancer,Aromatase Inhibitors in Premenopausal Breast Cancer Patients With Chemotherapy-Induced Ovarian Failure, Women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer are typically treated with hormone therapy as part of their treatment after surgery. In the past few years it has been found that treatment with aromatase inhibitors is superior to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen is still used for premenopausal women however because aromatase inhibitors are not effective in women who have functioning ovaries. Some women are premenopausal at the time they are diagnosed with breast cancer but then stop having menstrual periods when they are treated with chemotherapy. It is unclear if these women can also be treated safely with aromatase inhibitors. In this clinical trial the researchers will try to answer this question. Women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer who become postmenopausal with chemotherapy will be invited to participate in this study. Each woman will be treated with one of the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole (Arimidex) and then carefully monitored to ensure that her ovaries do not start making estrogen. If her estrogen level remains low then she will continued to be followed for 18 months. If the level increases to the level typically seen in premenopausal women however then she will stop taking part in this study. The study will also evaluate multiple factors that may help doctors predict who will tolerate the therapy without having their ovaries start making estrogen again. Some of the factors to be evaluated include other hormone levels (blood tests) as well as family history of early menopause (mother sisters). In addition changes in certain genes that affect how patients' bodies handle chemotherapy drugs will be tested to see if they affect whether or not patients recover ovarian function. Overall the purpose of the study is to determine which patients who become postmenopausal from chemotherapy are likely to tolerate aromatase inhibitor treatment safely and how often the patients' ovarian function needs to be tested during treatment.    ,NCT00555477
Breast Cancer,A Pilot Study to Evaluate the Safety and Activities of EW02 in Reducing Neutropenia Caused by Chemotherapy, Study Hypothesis: EW02 is a polysaccharide-enriched crude extract from black soybean (BS). BS has been used extensively by the Chinese as food or traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years. It has been used as monotherapy to treat Diabetes menorrhagia and leukorrhea. In combination with others BS has been used to treat chemotherapy-induced leukopenia on more than 300 pts. The daily doses were 15g bid to 50g tid for 21 days. Side effects were generally mild including epigastric discomfort numbness insomnia and dry mouth. Recently BS was found to promote myelopoiesis and inhibit tumor growth through immunomodulation. In vitro assays showed BS-PS can stimulate production of cytokines and increase blood progenitors. In vivo studies also demonstrated that BS-PS can reduce neutropenia in mice received 5-FU by stimulating myeloid colony formation. We hypothesize that EW02 can reduce neutropenia in cancer patients who receive chemotherapy without side effects.    ,NCT00555516

Breast Cancer,Healing Touch Quality of Life and Immunity During Breast Cancer Treatment, The purpose of this research study is to understand effects of a complementary medicine therapy Healing Touch on quality of life and immunity of patients who are receiving treatment for breast cancer. Healing Touch is a Holistic Therapy used as an adjunct to medical treatment. The goal of Healing Touch is to restore energy and vitality to the body as a patient is receiving treatment for cancer. Treatments include light touch on specific points on the body as well as around the body to increase well-being and support the body's ability to heal. Healing Touch has been shown to increase relaxation and well-being and to decrease anxiety pain and treatment side effects in a variety of illnesses including cancer. Although Healing Touch is frequently used by cancer patients along with their medical treatments very little is understood about the effects of this treatment on the immune system. The immune system is known to be important in the body's response to fighting cancer. We are studying Healing Touch to help us understand whether or not these treatments are effective in supporting the immune system during breast cancer treatment Aim 1. To evaluate effects of a healing touch (HT) intervention on cellular immunity among early stage breast cancer patients during radiotherapy. Aim 2. To evaluate effects of a Healing Touch (HT) intervention on cytokines associated with radiation damage and acute skin reactions in early stage breast cancer patients during radiotherapy. Aim 3. To evaluate the effects of a Healing Touch intervention on fatigue and mood in early stage breast cancer patients during radiation treatment.    ,NCT00565305
Breast Cancer,New Technique as an Additional Diagnostic Tool for Women Undergoing Neoadjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer, Molecular Breast Imaging is a highly promising novel methodology for breast cancer detection. Preliminary patient studies with our dual-detector system indicate that this system is capable of reliably detecting very small (5-10 mm) malignant lesions in the breast. Besides the usefulness of Molecular Breast Imaging for tumor detection we speculate that tumor uptake and washout may be predictors to response to neoadjuvant therapy for patients with the diagnosis of breast cancer. We propose that in patients with breast cancer who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant hormone therapy that molecular breast imaging is an accurate test for assessing response rate to neoadjuvant therapy.    ,NCT00566085

Breast Cancer,The Effect of Grape Seed Extract on Estrogen Levels of Postmenopausal Women," The role of estrogens in the pathogenesis of breast cancer has been well documented. This has led to the development of ""Anti-Estrogens"" (selective estrogens receptor modulators and Aromatase Inhibitors) used for treatment and prevention of breast cancer. These agents however have significant side effects which are not acceptable to many healthy high-risk women. There is preliminary evidence that grape seed extract acts as ""natural"" aromatase inhibitor (1). This study has the potential to quantify the effectiveness of a natural substance that mimics the action of pharmaceutical aromatase inhibitors.    ",NCT00566553
Breast Cancer,Dasatinib in Combination With Zoledronic Acid for the Treatment of Breast Cancer With Bone Metastasis, The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of dasatinib and Zometa (zoledronic acid) that can be given in combination for the treatment of breast cancer that has spread to the bone. The safety and effectiveness of this combination will also be studied.    ,NCT00566618
Breast Cancer,Bevacizumab Everolimus (RAD001) and Lapatinib as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Regimes for Primary Breast Cancer, Anthracycline-taxane based chemotherapy regimens are recommended mainly by current guidelines for neoadjuvant application of systemic treatment. The addition of other cytotoxic agents e.g. antimetabolites vincaalkaloids or platinum salts resulted in marginal increase in efficacy but was associated also with an increase in toxicity. Recently only the addition of the Her-2 antibody trastuzumab has significantly improved pathologic response rate. Therefore two major strategies are followed in current research projects:   -  To improve the selection of patients according to their tumors' sensitivity to chemotherapy.   -  To implement small molecules with specific mechanism of action. Within the GeparQuinto trial the first strategy is followed by:   -  The PREDICT substudy. A gene signature specific for the response to anthracyclines and taxanes will be prospectively evaluated for its ability to identify patients with chance higher than 50% for a pCR. The results may leed to a better risk-benefit ratio for the use of conventional chemotherapy.   -  Adapting further chemotherapy to the response of the tumor to the first couple of chemotherapy cycles. Based on the previous experience made by the GeparTrio study patients not responding early have a low chance to respond with a pCR irrespective of the type of chemotherapy. So if further chemotherapy is planned therapy should be selected according to a favorable toxicity profile. The second strategy is followed by investigating in three parallel group comparisons the efficiency of three distinct small molecules which appear to be generally active in breast cancer:   -  Bevacizumab an inhibitor of the VEGF pathway targeting tumor neo-angiogenesis.   -  Lapatinib an inhibitor of the Her-1 and Her-2 receptor tyrosine kinase.   -  RAD001 (Everolimus) an inhibitor of the mTOR molecule a central controller of tumor cell growth and angiogenesis and chemosensitizer. Treatment for patients participating in the GeparQuinto study will be allocated according to the Her-2 status of the tumor as well as according to the sonographic response after the first 4 cycles of treatment. Experimental therapy with bevacizumab lapatinib and everolimus (RAD001) will be randomly added in distinct settings.    ,NCT00567554

Breast Cancer,Arimidex With or Without Faslodex In Postmenopausal Women With HR Positive Breast Cancer, Over the last 3 decades a steady shift has occurred in the management of breast cancer. Because it was traditionally viewed as a local disease many advocated the use of radical surgery to achieve maximum survival benefit. This view has been slowly replaced by a broader biologic view that recognizes the often systemic nature of breast cancer even when it appears to be localized to the breast. Results from randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that less extensive surgery or lumpectomy plus radiation therapy are optimal for local management of early breast cancer. In addition to the less radical approach to surgical treatment of breast cancer other randomized clinical trials have established the value of postoperative systemic therapy in improving overall survival by eradicating micrometastatic disease the major cause of mortality from breast cancer. Despite the well-documented benefits of adjuvant systemic therapy it is not effective in preventing death from breast cancer in all patients who are candidates for such treatment. The worth of such therapy can only be judged in retrospect upon disease relapse a time when breast cancer is nearly always incurable. Currently there are few reliable methods to predict the success or failure of a particular postoperative treatment modality and better ways to predict and optimize outcome are needed. Combination endocrine therapy: Using endocrine agents with different mechanisms of action together has the potential advantage of more effectively blocking ER signaling thus improving the efficacy of such agents against breast cancer. In the past attempts to combine endocrine agents for ER-positive breast cancer have had mixed results depending on the setting and the patient population studied. Endocrine agents without any agonist effect could potentially be used in combination with aromatase inhibitors under the rationale that the combination would maximally blockade estrogen receptor signaling thus potentially improving the antitumor effect. Fulvestrant (FASLODEX) is a pure estrogen antagonist with no known agonist effect; thus it has the potential to provide additional benefit when combined with an aromatase inhibitor. This concept provides the rationale for using the combination of anastrazole and fulvestrant in this study.    ,NCT00570323
Breast Cancer,Brain Mets - Capecitabine Plus Sunitinib and WBRT, The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of concurrent whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and capecitabine followed by combination capecitabine and sunitinib in treating patients with CNS metastases from breast cancer.    ,NCT00570908

The intervention uses an Individual Sleep Promotion Plan to promote daytime activity and nighttime sleepand to decrease physchological and symptom distress   4. The healthy eating group receives equal time and attention and information on healthy eating   5. All participants receive a research nurse visit 2 days prior to each chemotherapy treatment and 30 60 90 days after the last treatment and one-year after the first treatment.   6. Adherence to the intervention is calculated at each time   7. Reliable and valid instruments are used including wrist actigraphy    ,NCT00572416
Breast Cancer,Pilot Study of 18F Fluoropaclitaxel (FPAC), Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a cause of treatment failure in many cancer patients. MDR refers to a phenotype whereby a tumor is resistant to a large number of natural chemotherapeutic drugs. Having prior knowledge of the presence of such resistance would decrease morbidity from unsuccessful therapy and allow for the selection of individuals who may benefit from co-administration of MDR inhibiting drugs. The Tc-99m labeled single photon emitting radiotracers sestamibi and tetrofosmin have shown some predictive value. However positron-emitting (PET) radiotracers which allow for dynamic quantitative imaging hold the promise of more accurate and specific identification of MDR tumors. Objective: To obtain human safety data to demonstrate imaging feasibility with FPAC to obtain human biodistribution and to obtain preliminary evidence of breast tumor uptake concordance with response to therapy.    ,NCT00572598
Breast Cancer,Sorafenib and Letrozole Anastrozole or Exemestane in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Estrogen Receptor-Positive and/or Progesterone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Aromatase inhibition therapy using letrozole anastrozole or exemestane may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. It is not yet known whether sorafenib is more effective than a placebo when given together with letrozole anastrozole or exemestane in treating metastatic breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works compared with a placebo when given together with letrozole anastrozole or exemestane in treating postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT00573755

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving erlotinib together with everolimus and to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT00574366
Breast Cancer,Trial for Locally Advanced Her2 Positive Breast Cancer Using Paclitaxel Trastuzumab Doxorubicin and Cyclophasmide on a Weekly Basis," Chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (Herceptin) are standard treatments for breast cancer. There are circumstances where these treatments are given prior to surgery to reduce the size of the cancer and imptove the surgical outcome. In this trial an oral drug called ""vorinostat"" will be given in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Vorinostat is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of a rare type of cancer involving the skin (cutaneous T cell lymphoma) but not for breast cancer. HDAC inhibitors work by unsilencing tumor suppressor genes and other genes in the cancer cells that are repressed; when the genes are turned back on by the drug it leads to death of the cancer cells. HDAC inhibitors such as vorinostat have been shown to enhance the effects of chemotherapy and trastuzumab in experimental systems. The purpose of this trial is to determine the optimal dose of vorinostat to use in combination with standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and to determine whether vorinostat enhances the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab.

Breast Cancer,Use of Breast MRI for Local Staging, When breast MRI is used to determine the extent of local disease the management changes resulting in improved outcomes. Studies have indicated that breast MRI plus mammography is better for detecting tumors. surgeons are now utilizing breast MRI to determine the extent of disease in women diagnosed with breast cancer. It has not been established how management of breast cancer patients has been affected by the use of breast MRI or how that management has affected the outcome for these patients. This retrospective chart review will document management and outcome for breast cancer patients who have had pre treatment breast MRI.    ,NCT00579319
Breast Cancer,Clinical Significance of Germline BRCA Mutations, The goal of this study is to help us learn more about the roles of genes and cancers that run in families. Sometimes we are born with genes that are changed or altered. Gene changes are called mutations. Mutations may be passed down from parent to child. Some mutations cause a high risk for cancer. There are two major genes for breast and ovarian cancer. These genes are called BRCA --for breast cancer. If you have a mutation in these genes special actions may be needed. For a person with a known mutation we will suggest ways to screen for cancer or prevent it. Not everything is known about cancer genes and mutations. The cancer screening we suggest may not always be effective. The aim of this study is to explore these questions. If you agree we will stay in touch with you to follow your medical history. We will also ask you about your family. This will allow us to measure the cancer risks of known mutations. The study will also look for other cancer genes we do not know about. Whether or not you take part in this study you may have gene testing. If you take part in this study and wish to know we will tell your BRCA gene test results. The investigators may perform genetic testing on the blood or saliva sample in one of two ways: analysis for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes alone or as part of a panel of genes associated with breast cancer predisposition. New technologies are being employed for identification of patients with a susceptibility for developing breast cancer and thus analysis of multiple genes at one time may be offered to you. If this multi-gene testing applies to the patient a question and answer sheet about this testing will be provided to them by their genetic counselor.    ,NCT00579488

Depression is one of the most common causes of emotional distress in the elderly and continues to be under-recognized. This is a problem because depression can have a negative impact on quality of life. The symptoms of depression are linked to poor health outcomes and higher costs of health care. In fact depression is one of the top five concerns facing the elderly today.    ,NCT00580476
Breast Cancer,A Randomized Comparison of Radiation Therapy Techniques in the Management of Node Positive Breast Cancer," Radiotherapy has been shown to reduce breast-cancer specific mortality in patients at high risk for distant dissemination. It has also been shown to increase rates of non-breast cancer deaths and morbidity due to cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity. Although treatment planning has improved significantly through the years recent reports still demonstrate treatment-related morbidity even with 3-dimensional planned techniques. Thus while 3D planning represents the state of the art treatment for loco-regional radiotherapy for breast cancer further improvement is needed to continue to decrease heart and lung exposure. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to determine whether treatment planning using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) the ""next generation"" of radiation treatment delivery systems results in less radiation exposure to the heart and lungs than the best current RT technique in women with node positive breast cancer. This proposal will test the potential clinical value of IMRT compared to the best standard 3D plan (partially wide tangent fields PWTF) in the treatment of breast cancer. These two treatment techniques will be studied in a Phase II randomized trial using quantitative indicators of potential cardiac and lung toxicity. The preliminary data generated from this trial will be used to ultimately justify a multi-institutional comparison of the two treatment techniques with long-term clinical cardiac and pulmonary toxicity as endpoints.

Breast Cancer,Molecular Genetic Basis of Invasive Breast Cancer Risk Associated With Lobular Carcinoma in Situ," This study is being done in order to better understand the biology of an abnormal lesion found in breast tissue called ""lobular carcinoma in situ"" (LCIS). We are interested in studying LCIS. The LCIS is not a cancer itself but is a marker for an increased risk of cancer. We would like to look for LCIS in breast tissue removed during surgery from patients with cancer or at high risk for cancer. If LCIS is found we will search for genes that are expressed (turned on or off) differently than in normal breast tissue. The identification of such genes would help us better understand the biology of LCIS and its possible relationship to breast cancer.    ",NCT00581750

Breast Cancer,Quantitative Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Breast MRI, The purpose of this study is to see if dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI imaging makes it possible to distinguish benign conditions of the breast from malignant tumors and provide better information than can be obtained with regular MRI. DCE MRI uses a new way of collecting and analyzing the images or pictures which provides doctors extra information not available with standard imaging methods. This includes information about the blood vessels of different breast diseases. Pictures produced this way look just like the regular MRI pictures. The DCE MRI adds another imaging sequence (another scan) to the MRI examination ordered by your physician to evaluate your breast lesion thus increasing the exam time (extra 10 min). The information gained from doing the new test the DCE MRI will not be used in your treatment and will not affect the type of care you receive for your breast lesions.    ,NCT00582764
Breast Cancer,Adherence to Intensive Surveillance for Hereditary Breast Cancer, Women with strong family histories of breast cancer are at increased risk to have breast cancer. Women whose close relatives have had breast cancer often have more breast cancer screening than other women their age. To increase the chance that any breast cancer will be caught early women at risk often take part in special screening programs. These programs involve more frequent visits to the doctor for breast exams yearly mammography and new types of exam like breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Studies are going on to find out whether these programs are better than standard screening. The purpose of this study is to find out how these programs impact women's quality of life. The study will also try to learn what factors make it hard to take part in the programs. We hope to be able to design new programs that are easier to follow.    ,NCT00582803

Breast Cancer,Study of Bone Mineral Density in Postmenopausal Women After Treatment for Breast Cancer, Bone Mineral Density (BMD) as measured by X-ray shows the amount of calcium in the bone. Low BMD may reflect osteoporosis a condition where there is an increased risk of fracture. Women who have gone through menopause have a higher risk of getting osteoporosis because they lose calcium from their bones much faster than younger women. Women with breast cancer may have an additional risk for getting osteoporosis because of the effects of their treatment with chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to see what levels of BMD post-menopausal women with breast cancer have and to see if the level of BMD changes during a women's treatment after her surgery. This trial studies changes in BMD and markers of bone activity in women receiving treatment for early stage breast cancer.    ,NCT00587925
Breast Cancer,Gene Expression Following Short Term Exposure to Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy in Invasive Breast Cancer, The purpose of this pilot study is to see if taking anastrozole (Arimidex) for 10 days causes changes in breast cancer cells. Anastrozole (Arimidex) is a drug used in the treatment of a type of breast cancer that depends on estrogen to grow. This type of breast cancer is called estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Anastrozole (Arimidex) works by blocking an enzyme in your body called aromatase. Aromatase is found in your muscles fat liver and in breast tumors. This enzyme is important for making estrogen in women who are no longer having menstrual periods. Anastrozole decreases levels of estrogen in the body. We are interested in seeing if taking anastrozole for 10 days will cause changes in breast cancer cells. We will study cell processes such as how they make new blood vessels how quickly the cells multiply and how soon they die. We will also study which genes in the breast cancer tissues are turned on or off by taking anastrozole for 10 days.    ,NCT00588003

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Accelerated Partial Breast Brachytherapy, Over the past two decades breast conserving therapy (BCT) has become a major treatment modality for Stage I and II breast carcinoma. The major advantages of breast conserving therapy are superior cosmetic outcome and the reduced emotional and psychological trauma afforded by this procedure compared with conventional mastectomy. The principal disadvantage of BCT is its more complex and prolonged treatment regimen requiring approximately 6 weeks of external beam radiation therapy that poses problems for some patients such as the working woman elderly patients and those who live at a significant distance from a treatment center. These factors along with the patient's geographic location result in a smaller fraction of the patients who currently meet eligibility criteria for BCT actually receiving it despite its cosmetic and probable psychological advantages. The logistical problems of BCT are primarily related to the protracted course of external beam radiation therapy to the whole breast. While some investigators reported what they believe to be acceptable local control rates in carefully selected patients treated by wide local excision without radiation therapy the criteria for patient selection are controversial and poorly defined and probably restrict the access of many patients to breast conserving therapy. If previous observations are valid and breast irradiation following tylectomy exerts its maximal effect in eradicating occult disease remaining in the immediate vicinity of the tylectomy site can radiation therapy be directed only to the tissue surrounding the excision cavity of the breast using brachytherapy alone? If so the entire course of radiation therapy could be delivered over a 4 to 7 day period immediately following tylectomy and/or axillary dissection thus markedly reducing treatment time. Brachytherapy also inherently provides a higher central dose to the volume most at risk for recurrence. Cosmetic outcome after the use of a brachytherapy boost after external whole breast radiotherapy is comparable or slightly inferior to electron beam boost radiation therapy    ,NCT00593346
Breast Cancer,Use of a Radiolucent Pad to Reduce Mammography Among African Americans, The objective of this study is to assess whether use of a mammography breast plate cushion will significantly decrease the level of discomfort experienced by African American women during routine screening mammograms.

Breast Cancer,Comparison of Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA®) and Tracheal Tube in Modified Radical Mastectomy on Breast Cancer, Airway management in anesthesia is critical to guarantee appropriate treatment of possible respiratory complications and successful operative practice. LMA® is an alternative to tracheal tube in some surgeries like as mastectomy on breast cancer. Given no need using muscular relaxants in mastectomy the investigators hypothesized that LMA® would be a superior manner in airway management in radical modified mastectomy on breast cancer than the tracheal tube and the LMA® might produce less influence on patients' circulatory homeostasis and easier to be placed before operation.    ,NCT00638599
Breast Cancer,Tissue Expander/Implant Reconstruction: A Single-Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial, Following mastectomy (removal of your breast) reconstruction of your breast(s) can be performed using tissue expanders and implants. At the same operation as your mastectomy a tissue expander is put under the skin and muscles of your chest. Following your surgery the tissue expander is gradually filled with salt water over a period of months. Once the expander is filled to the size of your new breast a second operation is performed. At this time the tissue expander is removed and a permanent breast implant is placed. This is a standard procedure. We are interested in learning about the use of AlloDerm in breast reconstruction. AlloDerm can be used instead of some of your own chest muscles in order to cover and protect a tissue expander. We want to know if the use of AlloDerm can decrease your pain or discomfort after surgery and after the filling of your tissue expander. AlloDerm is made from human tissue. When AlloDerm is made all the cells that could cause your body to reject it are removed. When it is placed in your chest your own cells will then grow into the AlloDerm causing it to act like the muscle it is replacing. In this study you will either have reconstruction with AlloDerm or without AlloDerm.    ,NCT00639106

Breast Cancer,A Pilot Observational Study to Assess Changes in Biochemical Parameters of Ovarian Reserve With Chemotherapy, Premenopausal women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are frequently treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can affect the ovaries and the effects can range from temporary loss of menstrual periods to permanent menopause. It is difficult to predict how an individual's ovarian function will be affected by chemotherapy. There are a number of hormones which can be measured in the blood which are related to fertility and ovarian function. The levels of these hormones may change with chemotherapy and may relate to the effect of chemotherapy on the ovaries. In this study we plan to enroll 28 women ranging in age from 25 to 50 who are diagnosed with breast cancer and will be treated with chemotherapy. We will check blood levels of the hormones before immediately after and 1 year after treatment with chemotherapy. We will only be checking these blood tests for this study; the type of chemotherapy given will be up to the patient and her oncologist. We will also ask some questions about factors that can influence the levels of these hormones such as number of children age of menopause of other family members and smoking history. The results from this study will be used to help us develop future studies looking at changes in ovarian function with chemotherapy and the effects of other breast cancer therapies such as endocrine therapy on the ovaries.    ,NCT00644683

Breast Cancer,Musculoskeletal Pain in Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy - A Pilot Study," In 2005 the EBCIG demonstrated the efficacy of tamoxifen in improving overall survival in hormone receptor positive breast cancers. However tamoxifen shows partial estrogen agonist activity which is responsible for the drug's detrimental effects such as endometrial carcinoma thromboembolism and tamoxifen resistance. More recently aromatase inhibitors have been shown to be superior to tamoxifen in the metastatic and adjuvant settings. The ATAC trial demonstrated improved disease-free survival (DFS) for 5 years of anastrozole compared to 5 years of tamoxifen 3. The BIG 1-98 trial results demonstrated that after a median follow-up of 25.8 months letrozole improved DFS and distant DFS when compared to tamoxifen. Based on these results adjuvant hormonal therapy with Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) has become the preferred therapy for post-menopausal woman. However AI therapy is also associated with toxicities that merit in-depth studies one of them being an increase in musculoskeletal pain. In the ATAC trial at a median follow-up of 5.7 years arthralgia was significantly higher (35.6% vs. 29.4%) and fractures were also increased (11.0% vs. 7.7%) when anastrozole was administered for 5 years following surgery with or without chemotherapy 3. The incidence of arthralgia was also significantly higher in the MA-17 trial with 25% of patients receiving letrozole developing arthralgia compared with 21% in the placebo group following 5 to 6 years of tamoxifen 5. Traditionally in cancer clinical trials the reporting of musculoskeletal pain has been based on the ""Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events"" which covers a wide range of symptoms and does not facilitate the documentation of a pain syndrome in a specific manner. Therefore there is a need to design a study that will describe the nature of the pain associated with the administration of AI therapy using tools that have been validated for capturing a multidimensional phenomenon such as pain.

Breast Cancer,IRS Proteins and Trastuzumab Resistance, Significant progress has been made in the treatment of women with Her2 positive breast cancer who are treated with trastuzumab a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits Her2. Despite this progress not all patients with Her2 positive metastatic breast cancer respond to trastuzumab and patients with metastatic disease who do respond usually develop progressive disease during treatment with trastuzumab. The mechanism of such resistance is unknown. We propose to investigate the mechanism of trastuzumab resistance in Her2 positive breast cancer. The hypothesis to be examined in the basic science section of this study is that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are modifiers of HER2 signaling and that these adapter proteins could be predictive indicators of treatment response to Herceptin in patients that are candidates for this targeted therapy. The connection between IRS-1 and IRS-2 expression and Herceptin response and clinical outcome in HER2 positive human breast tumors will be evaluated to determine if IRS expression correlates with resistance to Herceptin therapy and with the aggressive behavior of these tumors. This study will establish if the IRS proteins influence HER2 function in tumors and if they are predictive markers for evaluating treatment options for HER2 positive patients.    ,NCT00657345

Breast Cancer,Chemotherapy and Lapatinib or Trastuzumab in Treating Women With HER2/Neu-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer," RATIONALE: HER2/neu is a receptor (protein) which is found in unusually high amounts in approximately 1 in 5 cancer patients. Scientific evidence suggests that having high amounts of the HER2/neu receptor is important for breast cancer to grow and spread. Women with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread to other organs) and with high levels of the HER2/neu receptor receive as their usual treatment chemotherapy with one of the approved chemotherapy drugs paclitaxel or docetaxel (called ""taxanes"") together with another approved drug called ""trastuzumab"". Chemotherapy drugs such as paclitaxel and docetaxel work either by killing tumour cells or by stopping them from dividing. Trastuzumab is an antibody that is given through a vein in the arm and it works by specifically ""targeting"" the HER2/neu i.e. it attaches to it and ""turns it off"". Although some of the patients who receive this taxane plus trastuzumab treatment feel better for some months the cancer usually starts to grow again. Lapatinib is a new drug. Like trastuzumab it also works by specifically ""targeting"" the HER2/neu receptor but it does so in a different way. Lapatinib is not an antibody. It is a pill that is taken daily by mouth. Because lapatinib works in a different way than trastuzumab it may be worse as good as or better than trastuzumab in keeping metastatic HER/neu positive cancer from growing. However this is not known. Purpose: This randomized Phase III trial is comparing chemotherapy (a taxane) given together with lapatinib with chemotherapy (a taxane) given together with trastuzumab in women with HER2/neu positive breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,Assessment of Cardiotoxicity After Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer by Cardio-vascular Magnetic Resonance (MR), Consecutive patients with a first diagnosis of breast cancer will be identified at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre (TBCC) and included into the study if they are going to receive chemotherapy with anthracyclines and / or Trastuzumab and do not have contra-indications for the CMR study. Besides the usual clinical care for these patients (e.g. blood samples before each cycle of chemotherapy; MUGA scans to follow cardiac size and function) the patients will undergo serial contrast-enhanced CMR studies (before during and 9-12 months after completion of the chemotherapy); patients will be seen at an outpatient clinic in the Dept. of Cardiac Sciences / Heart Function Clinic for a clinical assessment (including ECG additional blood test like Troponin-T BNP 6-minute-walk-test) and recommendations will be made to medical treatment in patients with evidence for heart failure. Time points for the CMR and clinic assessments will be co-coordinated with regularly scheduled test by the TBCC to avoid unnecessary burden for the patients. The oncologists at the TBCC will be blinded to the results of the CMR studies and to laboratory results unless the participating cardiologists identify a clinical need for communication. Standardized CMR protocols will be employed and all interpretations will be blinded to the time course of the chemotherapy and cardiotoxic side effects. We will test the hypothesis whether CMR can be useful in patients with potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy to:   -  Identify patients at risk for the development of grade 2-4 cardiotoxic side effects as classified by the NCI guidelines (common toxicity criteria 2001 1-12)   -  Identify imaging parameters to predict early or late Cardiotoxicity   -  Provide additional clinical information to optimize medical treatment for heart failure    ,NCT00679874

Breast Cancer,Trial of Partial Breast Irradiation With Various Concurrent Chemotherapy Regimens, Breast conserving therapy (BCT) which consists of wide local excision of the tumor followed by 6 weeks of whole breast irradiation (WBI) is integral to the management of breast cancer. Evidence now suggests that WBI may not be necessary and treatment to the involved area only partial breast irradiation (PBI) may suffice. PBI can be achieved by interstitial or intracavitary brachytherapy intra-op or post op external beam radiation therapy. The feasibility toxicity and efficacy of PBI are currently being studied in both the U.S. and Europe. Review of smaller studies suggests that PBI will prove to be comparable to WBI. Chemotherapy combined with radiation has been shown to increase local control in BCT when compared to radiation alone. However there is little data on how sequencing or timing of these therapies with respect to one another affect outcome. As a result there is no consensus about the optimal combination. There are real and potential benefits to concurrent chemo-radiation therapy. Concurrent therapy 1) allows both treatments to start closer to surgery theoretically maximizing the benefits of each modality; 2) shortens the overall treatment program; and 3) may also improve local control via chemo-sensitization of residual cancer cells. However concurrent chemotherapy and WBI have been associated with prohibitive skin toxicity. Since less breast tissue is treated with PBI this skin toxicity may no longer be prohibitive. We have shown in J0381 that PBI and concurrent dose dense AC is safe. As a follow-up we propose a phase I/II trial addressing the toxicity and efficacy associated with PBI delivered concurrently with various chemotherapy regimens.    ,NCT00681993
Breast Cancer,Second-line Endocrine Treatment Followed by Capecitabine Versus Capecitabine Followed by Endocrine Treatment in Patients With Metastatic ER Positive Breast Cancer, This trial studies the effects on quality of life and on time to second progression of the sequence endocrine therapy-capecitabine versus the sequence capecitabine-endocrine treatment. It is anticipated that the time on study (which is the time between randomization and the discontinuation of the second treatment in the sequence) will be similar for both arms of the study. The quality of life during this period however could be better in the patient group receiving the most effective first agent in the sequence. If this proves to be true the conventional wisdom that endocrine therapy should be continued until no further endocrine options remain must be abandoned.    ,NCT00684216

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving cyclophosphamide methotrexate and prednisolone together with aromatase inhibitor therapy to see how well it works compared with cyclophosphamide methotrexate and prednisolone in treating postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT00687648
Breast Cancer,Fulvestrant With or Without Lapatinib and/or Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Progressed After Previous Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy, RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant and exemestane anastrozole or letrozole may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells and by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether fulvestrant is more effective with or without lapatinib and/or aromatase inhibitor therapy in treating breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying fulvestrant with or without lapatinib and/or aromatase inhibitor therapy to compare how well they work in treating postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer that progressed after previous aromatase inhibitor therapy.    ,NCT00688194

Breast Cancer,Relaxation and Visualization Therapy for Breast Cancer Patients, The purpose of this study is to find out if it is possible to study relaxation and visualization therapy (RVT) with individuals that have breast cancer. We will also look at what effects the good and bad RVT has when used with radiation therapy. We are interested in how RVT may relate to energy quality of life stress and the immune system. Relaxation and Visualization therapy will lead participants through a practice of physical relaxation and then a step by step visualization. In this study participants will be led through an RVT exercise providing an interactive process. In addition women will perform solitary RVT exercises at home on weekends. Participants for this study will be drawn from two OHSU physicians' regular patient base. To be sure that we are testing the effects of RVT alone we will use three groups. The three groups will be RVT education and a control. The RVT group will receive RVT with radiation and the education group will receive breast cancer related health education with radiation. The third group will receive no treatment beyond radiation. This third group is called the control. The entire study will last for approximately twelve weeks. For the first 6 weeks each participant will be receiving radiation therapy. We will be particularly interested in the effects that RVT may have on energy quality of life stress and the immune system.

Breast Cancer,The Role of Diet and Lifestyle in Breast Cancer Survival, Diet has been found to influence hormone production and metabolism which in turn could affect the incidence of hormone related cancers. Consumption of soy-containing foods known to be rich in phytoestrogens is thought to be one of the chemoprotective factors against breast cancer in Asian populations. Phytoestrogens have a wide range of metabolic effects and may have a role in effecting breast cancer risk. Although there is mounting evidence of the positive influence of phytoestrogens on breast cancer risk very little research has been carried out in humans as to the effects of phytoestrogens on breast cancer recurrence and survival. The DietCompLyf study aims to explore this effect by carrying out an observational study in 3000 breast cancer women in the UK. The effects of diet lifestyle practices and use of complementary treatments will also be investigated. Participants are recruited 9-15 months post-diagnosis and followed up for 5 years. Questionnaires as well as blood and urine samples are collected annually.    ,NCT00701584

Breast Cancer,Pilot Study Comparing Hypnotherapy and Gabapentin for Hot Flashes., Premenopausal women with breast cancer who receive endocrine therapy (e.g. tamoxifen) and/or chemotherapy are at risk for experiencing premature menopause because of their treatment. The resulting symptoms most notably hot flashes can cause significant detriment to a patient's quality of life. Treatment for menopausal symptoms with the gold standard of hormone replacement therapy is not done routinely as it is unclear whether it can increase risk of tumor recurrence. In addition many medical oncologists feel it is contraindicated in this population especially among women whose breast cancers have estrogen receptors. This has lead to an increased interest in options other than estrogen replacement in the treatment of hot flashes though most investigations of alternative medications have shown a suboptimal response. Recent studies have suggested that non-drug treatments using alternative or complementary therapies may be effective. Specifically hypnosis has been promoted as a means to control hot flashes though it has not been tested in a randomized fashion. In accordance with the National Cancer Institute's recent initiatives to expand the goals of clinical trials to include symptom management studies our purpose is to evaluate the role of complementary and alternative therapies for improvement of symptoms in women with breast cancer. Specifically we plan to evaluate the use of hypnotherapy for the treatment of therapy-induced hot flashes in breast cancer survivors. We intend to recruit 60 women into a pilot feasibility trial comparing hypnotherapy to the drug gabapentin (Neurontin®) for the treatment of therapy-induced hot flashes in eligible women who are receiving care at the Breast Health Center. We have chosen gabapentin based on recent studies showing it may be an effective non-estrogen treatment for this indication. We will identify patients who are experiencing at least one daily hot flash as a result of the treatment they received for their breast cancer for participation. When enrolled they will be randomized into either the treatment arm in which they will receive daily gabapentin or the experimental arm in which they will undergo weekly hypnotherapy. Our study hypothesis is that hypnotherapy will be more effective than gabapentin in the control of hot flashes in this population.    ,NCT00711529
Breast Cancer,Trastuzumab in Treating Women With HER2-Positive Early Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can block tumor growth in different ways.

Breast Cancer,Upper Extremity Lymphatic Mapping for Breast Cancer Patients, This study is being done to see if lymph nodes that drain the arm also drain the breast. An axillary lymph node dissection removes lymph nodes under the arm. It is done to help prevent cancer cells from spreading to the rest of the body. Usually about 12 to 15 nodes are removed. They are then examined to see if they have cancer cells. Removing these lymph nodes has some side effects. The most common is lymphedema. This is the build-up of fluid in the arm. This study will tell us if it may be possible in the future to identify lymph nodes that just drain the arm. Leaving those nodes may help to reduce the rate of lymphedema for future patients.    ,NCT00717886

Breast Cancer,Pre-operative Contrast Enhanced CT to Improve Delineation of the Tumorbed in Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer., Rationale: Whole breast irradiation with 50 Gy after lumpectomy has been shown to reduce the local recurrence rate with a factor 3 to 4. An additional boost of 16 Gy to the tumorbed has been shown to improve the local control rate even further. However this boost dose appears to reduce not only the local recurrences in the tumorbed but also elsewhere in the breast suggesting that the boost may not always be delivered at the correct region. In addition even with the boost dose of 16 Gy the local recurrence rate in young patients is still quite high - with the majority of recurrences in the tumorbed. Consequently further improvement of the local control especially in young women is still an important aim to pursue in order to maintain breast conserving therapy (BCT) as an acceptable treatment option in young women. One way to improve local control may be to increase the dose [Young Boost Trial] but also to improve the definition of the tumorbed i.e. the target volume for boost irradiation. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of incorporating a contrast-enhanced (CE)-CT-thorax in the target volume delineation process on 1) the coverage of the tumorbed by the 85% isodose 2) the size of the irradiated boost volumes and 3) the interobserver variation in target volume delineation. Study design: A CE-CT scan of the thorax will be made prior to surgery with the patient in radiation treatment position. After breast conserving surgery patients will be referred for post-operative radiotherapy according to the standard guidelines. Prior to radiotherapy a standard CT thorax scan will be made for treatment planning. The planning target volume (PTV) for the boost will be delineated according to the MAASTRO protocol by three independent observers (PTV-1A-C) using the planning CT only. Delineation of the boost will be repeated after 3D registration of the pre-operative CT scan with the planning CT-scan (PTV-2A-C). Thereafter consensus will be obtained for the PTV-1A-C and the PTV-2A-C resulting in one PTV-1 and one PTV-2 for each patient. Radiation treatment plans (RT-plans) will subsequently be designed for PTV-1 and PTV-2. Coverage of the treatment plans by the 85% isodose for both PTV-1- and PTV-2 and the irradiated volumes (percentage of the volume receiving 95% or more (V95)) will be calculated. Patients will be treated with the treatment plan for PTV-2. Study population: 60 breast cancer patients to be treated with BCT with a mass visible on mammography and/or ultrasound > 0.5 cm without contraindications for a CE-CT-thorax scan will be included. Intervention: < 3 weeks prior to lumpectomy a CE-CT-thorax scan will be made of the entire thorax with the patient in the same position as planned during the post-operative radiotherapy. Intravenous contrast will be given according to the standard thorax protocol of MAASTRO clinic. Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoints are:   1. The percentage of the PTV-2 receiving < 85% of the dose if treated with the RT-plan for PTV-1.   2. Difference in V95 for the RT-plan designed for PTV-1- versus for PTV-2. Other endpoints will be interobserver variation as measured by 1) percent volume overlap; 2) difference in standard deviation of the average PTV-1 and PTV-2; 3) center of mass assay. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation benefit and group relatedness: Patients will only be included after written informed consent. The preoperative CE-CT-thorax-scan yields little additional radiation exposure which will however be negligible compared to the radiation treatment to be given because of the breast cancer. In addition there is a small risk on an allergic reaction to the intravenous contrast and on renal complications. Therefore renal function will be checked prior to giving contrast. A kreatinine clearance < 60 ml/min will be a contra-indication for contrast. The pre-operative CT-scan will be made in MAASTRO clinic requiring an additional visit to MAASTRO clinic. A possible benefit may be that the pre-operative CE-CT thorax may improve the definition of the target volume and thereby reduce the risk on a local recurrence.    ,NCT00721058

Breast Cancer,Novel Capecitabine Dosing Schedule in Combination With Lapatinib Based on the Norton-Simon Mathematical Method in Patients With HER2 Overexpressed/Amplified Trastuzumab (Herceptin) -Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer," HER2 is a protein that sits on the surface of breast cancer cells in some people. Because you are one of these people your breast cancer is called ""HER2-positive."" The HER2 protein is involved in the growth of your breast cancer. Certain drugs can interfere with the ability of the HER2 protein to cause breast cancer growth. Trastuzumab is one of these drugs. You must have already received trastuzumab as treatment for your breast cancer to be considered for this study. Other drugs are being studied in women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Lapatinib (Tykerb?? blocks signals that stimulate HER2-positive breast cancers to grow. The FDA approved lapatinib for use with capecitabine (Xeloda?? in patients who have metastatic breast cancer that has grown or spread after treatment with trastuzumab. Capecitabine was approved by the FDA in 1998 for treating metastatic breast cancer. Capecitabine is a pill that blocks the way cancer cells multiply and grow. Usually this medicine is taken twice a day for fourteen days. Then patients do not take the pill for seven days. With this schedule and dose some patients have had side effects that interfered with their comfort. We have used mathematical models to recommend a new schedule of capecitabine. In animals 7 days of treatment with capecitabine followed by a 7-day break was safer and more active against breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out what effect (both good and bad) capecitabine has on you and your breast cancer when given in this new schedule and combined with lapatinib.    ",NCT00721630

Breast Cancer,Sorafenib and Fulvestrant in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer That Did Not Respond to Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy, RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving sorafenib together with fulvestrant may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving sorafenib together with fulvestrant works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that did not respond to aromatase inhibitor therapy.    ,NCT00722072

Breast Cancer,Carboplatin Abraxane Avastin as Neoadjuvant Therapy for Her2-Negative Breast Cancer, In the MDACC/BrUOG neoadjuvant trial with weekly paclitaxel followed by Fluorouracil Plus Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (FAC) the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in HER2(-) patients was 20%. The investigators' goal is to develop an induction chemotherapy regimen that will have a pCR rate above 30% in patients with HER2(-) disease. Based on a 1-sided 95% confidence interval using normal approximation with an expected pCR rate of at least 35% approximately 28 patients are required for each cohort. With an assumed pCR rate of at least 35% the investigators will have approximately 70% statistical power to conclude with 90% certainty that the pCR rate with the novel regimen exceeds 20%. The study will accrue approximately 60 patients in two cohorts with an inevaluable rate that does not exceed 10%.    ,NCT00723125

Breast Cancer,Nutritional Supplements and Hormonal Manipulations for Breast Cancer Prevention, The overall hypothesis is that the combination of a low dose of the antiestrogen Raloxifene with omega-3 fatty acids will exert a synergistic breast cancer chemopreventive effect due to the crosstalk of their downstream cellular effects leading to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of premalignant mammary cells. Based on the investigators hypothesis that upregulation of functional estrogen receptors in the premalignant lesions is also responsible for the development of hormone independent tumors the investigators postulate that the combination of antiestrogens and omega-3 fatty acids will reduce the development of both hormone-dependent and -independent tumors. At present there are no known interventions able to decrease the development of hormone-independent tumors which are more prevalent more aggressive leading to the patient's demise. In addition the investigators postulate that this approach will be safe since it will combine a lower and hence a less toxic dose of Raloxifene with the administration of omega-3 fatty acids which are known to have health benefits i.e. reduction in cardiovascular risk beyond their possible chemo preventive effect in breast cancer.    ,NCT00723398

Breast Cancer,Prospective Trial of Vaccine Responses Against Pneumococcus and Influenza in Adult Cancer Patients 65 Years of Age and Older, Infections due to influenza and pneumococcus can be very serious and cause death. Anyone can get these infections. However some people are at greater risk from the disease including people 65 and older the very young and people with special health problems such as people with certain types of cancer heart lung or kidney disease or diabetes. Influenza can cause a very serious lung infection (pneumonia) and increase the risk of stroke and heart attacks. Pneumococcal disease can lead to serious infections in the lungs (pneumonia) the blood (bacteremia) and the covering of the brain (meningitis). People with the special health problems mentioned above are even more likely to die from the disease. Although there are drugs to treat these infections they are not always effective. This makes prevention of the disease through vaccination even more important. This study will look at the body's response to influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. We want to see how well they it will protect. Immunization is the same as vaccination. Our goal is to protect as much as we can. We are doing the study because more information is needed to see how well older patients with cancer respond to these vaccines and how well they protect against disease caused by influenza and pneumococcus.    ,NCT00741039

Breast Cancer,Anastrozole and Letrozole, Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) are effective for secondary prevention of breast cancer and may soon replace tamoxifen as first-line therapy in the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer. However because these medications produce a marked reduction in serum estrogen levels this is likely to result in an increased rate of bone loss and risk of developing osteoporosis and fractures in postmenopausal women treated with these agents. Indeed substantial bone loss has been reported in several large clinical trials of AIs. Osteoporosis drugs are available that could prevent this loss but they have frequent side effects and are expensive. Thus treating all women receiving AIs might not be the most appropriate and cost-effective approach. A better approach might be to select women at highest risk of bone loss and only treat them with antiresorptive agents. The proposed pilot study will evaluate women who receive anastrozole or letrozole therapy are receiving adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D and have baseline normal or moderately low bone mass in order to determine if early changes in bone turnover markers correlate with bone loss at one year. If data from this pilot protocol support our hypothesis then we would propose a larger trial to confirm it. The ultimate aim is to predict which women are at higher risk of bone loss and therefore treat them earlier with bone-sparing agents while those with lower risk could be monitored on conservative therapy.    ,NCT00762294

Breast Cancer,Weight Reduction Intervention for Breast Cancer Survivors, Overweight or obesity is an established negative prognostic factor in both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the adverse effect of excess body fat on prognosis following the diagnosis of breast cancer including increased circulating sex hormones insulin leptin and various growth factors. Results from previous studies suggest that specific strategies can facilitate weight reduction and maintenance of weight loss in this target population. This randomized clinical trial will recruit 253 overweight or obese women who have been previously treated for early stage breast cancer and will test whether a multifaceted approach to promoting healthy weight management can achieve the goal of weight loss and maintenance. Additionally this study tests whether weight loss is associated with changes in biological and psychosocial factors including eating attitudes and behaviors and health-related quality of life. The intervention incorporates cognitive-behavioral therapy increased physical activity diet modification to facilitate a modest reduction in energy intake and strategies to improve body image and self-acceptance. This approach and intervention have been pilot-tested with breast cancer survivors in a developmental project which resulted in the intervention group losing significantly more weight than the wait-list control group. Study Aims include: testing whether an intervention that emphasizes increased physical activity and individualized diet modification to promote an energy imbalance is associated with a greater degree of weight loss and maintenance of that loss over an 18-month time period; describing the effect of the intervention on hormones and growth factors; describing the relationships between body weight and weight reduction and measures of selected psychosocial factors. Measurements of hormonal and psychosocial factors in this study will provide insight into the responsiveness of these factors to weight loss in overweight or obese breast cancer survivors which will provide an indication of the degree of clinical benefit that is achieved with the intervention efforts. Results from this study may enable the development of broader efforts transferable to clinical practice and public health and thus may ultimately have a substantial effect on the risk for recurrence and long-term survival of the estimated 1.98 million breast cancer survivors in the U.S. today.    ,NCT00774371

Breast Cancer,Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Preference Study, Mammography remains the current standard in the detection of breast cancer. However conventional two-view mammography will not detect all cancers. The major limiting factor of conventional mammography is the presence of superimposed breast tissue that can obscure clinically significant lesions. It is this limitation that decreases the sensitivity of mammography and leads to false negative results. The recent development of digital detectors has allowed imaging technologies such as tomosynthesis to become clinically feasible. The examination similar to conventional mammography with regard to patient positioning and glandular dose allows acquisition of a digital data set that can be reconstructed and viewed in multiple sections. The ability of tomosynthesis to unmask overlapping structures has been shown in preliminary studies to increase lesion visibility. Used as either a primary imaging modality or as an adjunct to screening mammography tomosynthesis has the potential to provide increased sensitivity and a lower number of false negative examinations. The purpose of this study is to compare radiologist impression of digital breast tomosynthesis to digital mammography with respect to their ability to see and characterize specific lesion features.    ,NCT00776126
Breast Cancer,Use of Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) to Detect Additional Disease in Women With Breast Cancer Who Are About to go to Surgery, Conventional mammography is not a reliable method for determining the extent of disease in women with breast cancer. Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) is a new nuclear medicine technique that allows the breast to be imaged in a manner similar to mammography but without the pain of compression. Initial results with this method have shown it is very good at detecting small breast cancers (~1/4 inch). The purpose of this study is to see if MBI is a better method than mammography in determining how much cancer is present before a woman goes to surgery. The study will comprise 120 women with breast cancer who are going to surgery. The investigators hope that this study will demonstrate that MBI will be more accurate in determining how much cancer is present.    ,NCT00776308

Breast Cancer,Monitoring of Breast Tissue Change Due to Hormone Replacement Therapy in Post-menopausal Women Using OBS, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is a double edged sword: it can alleviate the effects of menopause for a significant proportion of the female population however for a smaller proportion it will induce a significant increase in their short-term and lifetime risk to develop breast cancer (BC). Fewer women are prescribed HRT compared to a decade ago due to concerns pertaining to BC by both physicians and patients. By developing a technology that could identify women at risk for the adverse effects of HRT during the first few months of its use physicians may offer HRT to a wider proportion of the female population during menopause. More importantly as it relates to BC prevention such a technology will identify women at risk and provide a useful decision making tool regarding their care during the menopausal years.    ,NCT00797199
Breast Cancer,Panther: A Study Comparing Biweekly and Tailored EC-T Versus Three Weekly FEC-T in Breast Cancer Patients, This is an adjuvant open prospective randomized study to compare: A. Individually tailored and two weekly dosed epirubicin + cyclophosphamide followed by a three weeks break followed by biweekly and tailored docetaxel (dtEC?dtT) given every second week to B. Fixed dosed and three weekly epirubicin cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil followed by fixed dosed and three weekly docetaxel (FEC?T). Patients with primary node-positive or high risk lymph node negative breast cancer will be eligible for the study. The primary objective of the phase 3 study is to compare breast cancer relapse-free survival (BCRFS) between the dtEC?dtT and FE100C?T. To detect a five-year BCRFS difference of 0.710 to 0.790 about 1000 patients per arm will be needed. They will be recruited during four years and followed another two years for breast cancer events. Secondary objectives are to compare   1. Distant disease-free survival (DDFS)   2. Event-free survival and   3. Overall survival   4. Health-related quality of life and toxicity analyses according to CTC   5. Outcome in relation to tumour biological factors and polymorphism patterns   1. RFS in relation to the Sorlie classes using immunohistochemical markers and/or gene expression profiling comparing A vs B arm   2. RFS with receptor positive disease (analyzed in the local laboratories as described in the CRFs and also analyzed as continuous variables) in the comparison between the A- and B- arms.   3. RFS with high and low proliferation respectively (analyzed in the local laboratories as described in the CRFs and also analyzed as a continuous variable or centrally analyzed) in the comparison between the A- and B-arms.   4. RFS in relation to HER-2/neu status (analyzed in the local laboratories as described in the CRFs) in the primary cancers in the comparison between the A- and B-arms and analyzed whether trastuzumab was given in sequence or concurrently.   5. RFS analyzed in relation to other molecular markers (e.g. gene expression profiling/ sequencing) in the primary cancers and SNPs signatures in normal DNA (related to toxicities for EC/FEC and docetaxel components respectively and given dose levels and outcome in relation to these factors and in relation QoL) to outcome per arm.   6. RFS analyzed in relation to tumour associated lymphocytes and Y-box binding protein in the comparison between the A- and B-arms. Tumour tissue will be obtained and stored for studies of prognostication and therapy prediction. Last patient randomized was September 2011.    ,NCT00798070

Breast Cancer,A Dose-Finding Study of Subcutaneous Herceptin (Trastuzumab) in Healthy Male Volunteers and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Positive Females, This two-part study is designed to select the subcutaneous (SC) dose of Herceptin that results in comparable exposure to intravenous (IV) Herceptin in healthy male participants and in HER2-positive female participants. The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of the SC and IV formulations. In Part 1 of the study four cohorts will be treated with a single dose of Herceptin as follows: Cohort 1 (6 milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg] IV in healthy male participants); Cohort 2 (6 mg/kg IV in HER2-positive female participants); Cohort 3 (6 mg/kg SC in healthy male participants); Cohort 4 (10 mg/kg SC in healthy male participants). An additional cohort of healthy volunteers (Cohort 5) will be opened if both SC dose levels from Cohorts 3 and 4 result in Herceptin exposures different from the target concentration produced by a single IV dose or if the variability in pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter values cannot be used to define the target SC dose level. In Part 2 of the study HER2-positive female participants will receive a single dose of SC Herceptin at the dose level defined in Part 1. Participants from Part 1 are eligible to enter Part 2 provided they receive the second (Part 2) study dose of Herceptin a minimum of 22 days after their first (Part 1) dose.    ,NCT00800436
Breast Cancer,Cyclophosphamide and Docetaxel or Doxorubicin in Treating Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed by Surgery, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide docetaxel and doxorubicin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying cyclophosphamide given together with docetaxel to see how well it works compared with cyclophosphamide given together with doxorubicin in treating women with newly diagnosed breast cancer that can be removed by surgery.    ,NCT00801411
Breast Cancer,Pre-operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Young Breast Cancer Patients, Young women with breast cancer have an increased breast tissue density and conventional imaging tests such as mammography and breast ultrasound are less sensitive and specific for detecting breast cancer than in older breast cancer patients. Breast MRI is an emerging tool that has been proven to improve the ability to identify breast cancers by determining the extent of disease and also detect multifocal multicentric and bilateral breast cancers. To date the role of pre-operative breast MRI is not clearly defined. The investigators are proposing a study to evaluate the impact of preoperative breast MRI on surgical decision-making in breast cancer patients <= 50 years. This may lead to improved characterization of breast cancers in these younger patients that may ultimately result in lower local recurrence rates in the future. The additional information attained through the breast MRI may also guide the use of radiation chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy in these patients.    ,NCT00801476
Breast Cancer,3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy or Internal Radiation Therapy After Breast-Conserving Surgery in Treating Women With Stage I or Stage II Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy such as 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Giving these treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is more effective than internal radiation therapy when given after surgery in treating early-stage breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy to see how well it works compared with internal radiation therapy when given after breast-conserving surgery in treating women with stage I or stage II breast cancer.    ,NCT00802711

Breast Cancer,Phase II Study of Simvastatin in Primary Breast Cancer; Test of Its Potential Selectivity on Basal Subtype Breast Cancer, We hypothesize that Simvastatin administration would result in selective killing of the basal subtype of breast cancer in particular CD44+/CD24- breast cancer cells in primary tumor. We further hypothesize that tumor genomic changes would correlate with tumor response to Simvastatin. We are also looking to correlate Simvastatin biological effects with the expression pattern of initial status of primary tumor. In addition we hypothesize that Simvastatin-induced tumor gene expression changes may correlate with tumor and plasma proteomics peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression changes and pharmacogenetics and that these analyses may further refine the selection of patients most likely to benefit from Simvastatin.    ,NCT00807950

Breast Cancer,Prevention of Breast Cancer: As Simple as hCG-A Randomized Clinical Trial in High Risk Women, The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether hCG will result in a decrease in breast density. High breast density has been associated with an increased risk in breast cancer. It has also been shown that decreasing density with a drug called tamoxifen has resulted in a decreased risk in breast cancer. The investigators are looking at the effect of hCG on breast density in people who are at increased risk of developing breast cancer and our theory postulates that through the hormonal actions of hCG and tamoxifen there would be a greater reduction in breast density in patients who are treated with hCG and tamoxifen versus patients treated with tamoxifen alone. Using this data the investigators will be able to hypothesize that the treatment of hCG will result in a reduction in breast cancer rates in the population and thus make available another drug which can be used to decrease the rates of breast cancer in the population    ,NCT00808522
Breast Cancer,Arimidex Bone Mass Index and Oral Bisphosphonates, To investigate the management of bone health in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer (BCA) scheduled to receive anastrozole.

Breast Cancer,Randomized Trial of Acupuncture for Aromatase Inhibitor Induced Joint Pain, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of acupuncture as a complementary therapy to pain medication for joint pain associated with aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer treatment. Breast cancer patients are living longer largely due to the benefits of hormonal therapy. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a new class of hormonal agents which block estrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women. However musculoskeletal pain occurs in up to 50% of patients treated with AIs and often does not respond to conventional pain medications. AI-induced joint pain interferes with patient compliance and may cause major disability. Therefore safe and effective treatments are needed to alleviate AI-induced musculoskeletal pain. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese method of medical treatment and a popular modality for treating musculoskeletal pain. Acupuncture involves the use of thin needles to stimulate specific points of the body and leads to pain control through the release of endorphin in the central nervous system. Clinical trials have found a benefit of acupuncture for the treatment of knee and back pain. Given the lack of effective treatments for AI-induced joint pain and the safety and efficacy of acupuncture it is therefore reasonable to evaluate whether acupuncture is effective in breast cancer patients who experience musculoskeletal pain related to AIs. This is a randomized controlled pilot study twenty participants will be recruited in each arm directly by their oncologist from the Breast Oncology clinic of Columbia University Medical Center. The study will include postmenopausal women over the age of 45 years currently taking an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of early stage breast cancer and experiencing musculoskeletal pain in one or more joints. We hypothesize that acupuncture will reduce AI induced joint symptoms    ,NCT00826397

Breast Cancer,Cellular Immunotherapy Study With Autologous Dendritic Cells Loaded With Oncofetal Antigen/iLRP in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer," The study uses a molecule or particle that is found only on cancer cells and is unique to cancer cells as it is not detected on normal tissue. The molecule is known as ""oncofetal antigen"" or OFA. Because OFA is unique to cancer the investigators feel OFA could be used to educate the patients' own defenses to more effectively fight the cancer on his or her own that he or she is harboring. Although investigators found OFA to be present in large concentrations on all cancers it was found to be especially abundant in breast cancers. Therefore the investigators feel that this molecule would be a good target for stimulating patient defenses especially against breast cancer cells. To accomplish this certain defense cells (immune cells)will be washed out from the patients' blood using a machine to which the patient is connected through two small cannula placed into veins located in the patients' arms those cells will be manipulated in the laboratory with artificially engineered OFA. These ""reeducated"" cells will be injected into the skin of patients. There will be a series of three skin injections in 4 week intervals.

Breast Cancer,Topical Application of Sulforaphane-containing Broccoli Sprout Extracts on Radiation Dermatitis, The investigators plan to investigate the protective effects of topical sulforaphane-containing broccoli-sprout extracts (BSE) on radiation-induced dermatitis in women undergoing external-beam radiation therapy for breast cancer. Topical sulforaphane induces phase 2 enzymes that are protective against oxidants electrophiles and inflammation (Talalay and Fahey 2001) - all of which are generated by both ultraviolet and ionizing radiation. Previous work from the investigators' group demonstrated that sulforaphane treatment protects against ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema of human skin (IRB protocol NA_00004897; Talalay et al. 2007). This investigation will extend the investigators' previous work by employing ionizing rather than ultraviolet radiation. The investigators propose a two part sequential protocol (Study A and Study B). Both studies will involve women with breast cancer who have undergone lumpectomy and are scheduled for adjuvant external beam radiation treatment. In study A the investigators will validate their technique for measurement of skin erythema using a device called a chromometer; no active agent will be applied (up to 6 women). Study B will follow completion of Study A. Study B will involve the application of broccoli sprout extracts (BSE) or vehicle alone to determine if sulforaphane can reduce radiation-induced erythema (27 women). Four adjacent 1.5-cm diameter areas-of-interest on the affected breast will be located by means of an adhesive vinyl template which can be accurately and repeatedly placed at the same position. Two of the four areas will be treated with BSE (active agent) and two with vehicle (inactive control). BSE will be applied on three days weekly throughout the 5-week period of whole breast radiation. Erythema will be noninvasively quantified by measuring the red-reflectance of the skin with a chromometer up to three times weekly throughout treatment. A total of 33 patients are to be enrolled. The investigators' objective is to determine and quantify the effect of topical BSE on radiation-induced skin erythema. This study will employ standard clinically-accepted radiation doses and techniques that are safe and well tolerated. The safety and tolerability of both oral and topical broccoli sprout preparations is well established; no safety concerns have been noted.

Breast Cancer,Extended Endocrine Therapy for Premenopausal Women With Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of two drugs (letrozole and leuprolide) in women who have already taken tamoxifen for at least 4.5 years. Letrozole an aromatase inhibitor (which blocks an enzyme that produces estrogen) is a drug that is FDA approved. It has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence in postmenopausal women with breast cancer who have been previously treated with tamoxifen. Letrozole works by stopping the production of estrogen in parts of the body other than the ovaries. Leuprolide is a drug that stops a women's ovarian cycles. This process is known as ovarian function suppression. Stopping a women's menstrual cycle may be effective against breast cancer for some patients when given as initial therapy. The combination of letrozole and leuprolide is considered a standard treatment for women with metastatic breast cancer and is also sometimes used for treatment of premenopausal early stage breast cancer but it has not been accepted as a standard of care treatment.    ,NCT00903162

Breast Cancer,Optical Tomography With Ultrasound Guidance, The investigators propose to validate the utility of their novel hybrid imaging technique for accurate diagnosis of breast lesions and for assessing chemotherapy response of cancer treatment and predicting treatment efficacy. The investigators' unique hybrid technique is implemented by simultaneously deploying near infrared (NIR) optical sensors and a commercial ultrasound (US) transducer mounted on a hand-held probe and utilizing co-registered lesion structure information provided by ultrasound to improve the optical tomography. As a result the optical tomography assisted with US has overcome problems associated with intense light scattering and has provided reliable tumor angiogenesis distributions. Initial results with a small group of patients who underwent biopsy have shown that early stage invasive cancers present two-fold greater total hemoglobin concentration on average than fibroadenomas and other benign lesions. Initial results of advanced cancers have shown that the angiogenesis distribution is highly distorted and heterogeneous and the distorted distributions correlate with histological microvessel density counts and can be used to assess chemotherapy response. The objective of this study is to validate the investigators' initial results that NIR light guided by ultrasound can improve breast cancer diagnosis and monitor chemotherapy response.    ,NCT00908609
Breast Cancer,Proof of Principle Trial to Determine if Nutritional Supplement Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) Can Modulate the Lipogenic Pathway in Breast Cancer Tissue, Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) is obtained in the human diet by consumption of foods containing ruminant fat. Milk and dairy products have shown the highest amounts of CLA. Clarinol (CLA) is considered a natural supplement and is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). CLA is known to inhibit proliferation of human breast cancer cells and tumors in rodent breast cancer models and reduced Spot 14 (THRSP S14) and Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) gene expression in breast cancer cells and tht the two major CLA isomers used in nutritional supplements (C9 t11 and t10 c12) were equipotent in reducing breast cancer cell growth. This study looks at the hypothesis that S14 expression is decreased by CLA and will characterize the major pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of CLA in newly diagnosed Breast cancer patients on Tumor tissue lipogenic pathway. FASN S14 and Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) Ki67 and apoptotic index expression will be assessed by quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) in initial breast cancer biopsies and compared to that in resected breast tumor tissue after the study subject has been taking CLA for ten to twenty-eight days. Tissue from adjacent breast adipocytes will also be analyzed to determine whether adipose tissue effects can serve as a surrogate marker for those in tumor tissue. A sample of the original biopsy will be compared to the tumor resection sample to determine the levels of CLA in the breast cancer cells.    ,NCT00908791

Breast Cancer,Drug Withdrawal in Women With Progressive Breast Cancer While on Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy, The purpose of this research study is to study the effects of stopping aromatase inhibitory (AI) therapy on breast cancer progression. Aromatase inhibitors are a class of drugs used to treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women. They work by decreasing the level of estrogen which is believed to stimulate the growth of tumor tissue. Breast cancer that progresses despite therapy with an AI is thought to have been resistant to AI therapy. There is scientific evidence to suggest that resistant breast cancer cells learn to grow at the very low levels of estrogen present on AI therapy and that increasing estrogen levels even slightly by stopping AI therapy with inhibit the breast cancer cells. An improvement or stabilization of breast cancer has been observed after stopping therapy with tamoxifen a different anti-estrogen therapy and has been reported in the literature after stopping AI therapy. This research study will be the first study to formally test the rate of disease improvement (response) or stabilization after stopping AI therapy.    ,NCT00916162

Breast Cancer,Automating Breast Radiation Therapy (RT), Breast radiation treatment is planned from a Computed Tomography (CT) scan. This study is designed to investigate a method to reduce the time between the planning of radiation treatment and its actual start by automating the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning process. The investigators plan to examine data from another scan called Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). A CBCT scan provides similar information to a conventional CT scan however the images for CBCT are acquired at the treatment unit (linear accelerator used for treatment). Using these x-ray pictures of patients the study team consisting of a radiation oncologist a medical physicist and a radiation therapist will create a custom treatment plan unique to each patient.

Breast Cancer,Bevacizumab Metronomic Chemotherapy (CM) Diet and Exercise After Preoperative Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer, If residual breast cancer is found in the breast or lymph node tissue removed after preoperative chemotherapy one may be at increased risk of breast cancer recurrence in the future. The purpose of this research study is to determine if having additional treatment after preoperative chemotherapy and surgery with bevacizumab and metronomic chemotherapy would make a difference in reducing the participants chance of breast cancer recurrence compared to the standard of care which is observation alone. This study will evaluate the potential additional benefits from participating in an exercise and dietary intervention compared to the dietary intervention alone. Bevacizumab is an antibody that is made in the laboratory. Bevacizumab works differently from the way chemotherapy drugs work. Bevacizumab works to slow or stop the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply to tumors. Bevacizumab has been approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced colorectal lung and kidney cancers. Metronomic chemotherapy also attacks tumor blood supply. Standard chemotherapy drugs are used cyclophosphamide and methotrexate (CM) but in very small daily doses by mouth well below the threshold where they can cause people to feel sick. Previous research studies have shown that women with breast cancer who take metronomic CM and bevacizumab feel very well and the combination therapy is active in reducing their cancer. Participants in this study will also be provided with diet or diet and exercise counseling over the telephone. Studies have shown that many women who are treated for breast cancer will gain weight during and after their treatment and may also experience fatigue and weakness. Many studies have shown that making changes in diet and increasing exercise can help prevent weight gain and also may increase energy and decrease other side effects of chemotherapy and other breast cancer treatments.    ,NCT00925652

Breast Cancer,Arimidex Therapy Compliance Electronic Monitoring System," ARTEMIS is a study to assess how educational material affects overall adherence to anastrozole by evaluation of patients' electronically compiled dosing histories. Patients' dosing times are compiled electronically using Medication Event Monitoring System"" (MEMS®) in order to be able to gather accurate objective and up-to-date patients' dosing histories. For subjects in Group A the control group the adherence to anastrozole in the standard clinical practice will be evaluated. For subjects in Group B on top of the standard clinical practice they will also receive educational material by mail at week 0 (study registration) week 2 week 4 week 6 week 8 week 12 month 5 month 7 and at month 10. This procedure is the same as in the ongoing CARIATIDE study. One of the reasons of poor adherence (either early discontinuation of the treatment or missing doses while still engaged to the therapy) can be some side effects experienced by the patients during the anastrozole treatment. Recording the reasons at discontinuation allows us to identify reasons for treatment discontinuation. Recording reasons of anastrozole interruptions during the study period allows us to relate these events to patients' adherence to anastrozole. During the study no pro-active safety data collection will take place. Spontaneous reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) will be reported according to local post-marketing pharmacovigilance regulations.    ",NCT00936442

Breast Cancer,Couple-Focused Intervention for Breast Cancer Patients, The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 couple-focused interventions developed to reduce the psychological distress on women and their partners during and after the breast cancer experience. The first group an Enhanced Couple-Focused Group (ECG) incorporates cognitive-behavioral interventions (e.g. relaxation stress management skills) as well as basic relationship communication and support skills (e.g. expressing support needs constructively). The second group a Couples' Support Group (SG) is a non-structured group where general topics are discussed. The investigators will evaluate the impact of each group condition on patients' psychological adaptation social and role functioning and cancer treatment adherence. The investigators will also evaluate whether patient and partner perceptions of relationship support relationship intimacy stress management skills and intervention group support mediate the groups' effects on each other's psychological adaptation. The investigators hypothesize that ECG will have stronger positive effects on patient general and cancer-related distress and well-being than SG. The investigators hypothesize that group support will mediate greater improvements in patient psychological functioning in both groups but that the effects of group support will be significantly stronger in SG than ECG.    ,NCT00940277

Breast Cancer,Scripps Polster Breast Care Center Investigational GeneBank, Breast cancer is a disease of complex origin with a strong genetic component. The incidence of breast cancer is very high in monozygotic twins of patients and it is thought that a high proportion and perhaps the majority of breast cancers arise in a small number of genetically susceptible women. Recent studies in human genetics have discovered several intervals in the human genome containing inherited variants that are statistically associated with the propensity to develop breast cancer. The investigators plan to use this knowledge to design a genetic screening test to guide recommendations for breast cancer screening with mammography. If the small group of genetically susceptible women can be identified more effective breast cancer screening strategies can be implemented. In contrast a very large proportion of women who undergo yearly mammography are at exceptionally low risk from a genetic perspective. Using genomic guidance could eventually reconfigure the most efficacious strategy to screen women for early detection of breast cancer. By developing a genetic screening panel based on genetic markers for breast cancer the investigators will be able to more accurately determine a woman's individual risk for developing breast cancer.    ,NCT00945464

Breast Cancer,Computed Tomography (CT) Based Lymphatic Mapping and Localization of Sentinel Lymph Node in Breast Cancer Patients, Breast cancer patients who diagnosed by core needle biopsy or excisional biopsy underwent CT scan to locate the sentinel lymph node (SLN) before SLN biopsy (SLNB) at the same day of surgery. When CT examination performed those patients were in supine position with the arms stretched upward but bent at the elbow with the hands at the side of the cranium which similar to the surgical position. After local anesthesia 2mL of iopamidol was injected subcutaneously to the peritumoral and peri-areolar areas followed by gentle massage for about 1 minute. Contiguous 2-mm-thick CT images that included the breast and axilla were obtained prior to administration of the contrast agent. After 3D CT reconstruction the SLN was identified as the most inferiorly visible nodule in the axilla connected to the lymphatic vessel on the CT imaging monitor. A professional intervention doctor punctured the defined lymph node guided by the CT monitor using the Breast Lesion Localization Needles (interv). The needle would stay in the patient's axilla until the surgery. All the lymph nodes including the CT defined one and which marked by methylene blue dye or 99mTc-sulfur colloid tracers were removed which then would be tested by touch imprint cytology for the intraoperative diagnosis. Patients who had positive SLN would receive axillary dissection. The investigators evaluated the new method by comparing lymph nodes defined by CT and traditional ways.    ,NCT00952679

Breast Cancer,Letrozole Plus Oral Cyclophosphamide Plus/Minus Sorafenib as Primary Systemic Treatment in Breast Cancer Patients, Endocrine therapy is the mainstay of systemic treatment in patients with endocrine responsive breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors are the most active agents in post-menopausal women. Randomized comparisons either in primary/adjuvant setting or in metastatic disease setting have demonstrated the superiority of these drugs over tamoxifen. Primary systemic treatment administered to breast cancer patients is a useful model to identify baseline features able to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from cytotoxic treatment and is a way to study new biological markers in relation to the predictive information they provide. This treatment modality represents therefore the best way to explore new treatment strategies in particular treatment strategies involving target therapies. We have conducted a randomised phase II trial in which the activity of Letrozole plus/minus oral metronomic cyclophosphamide as primary systemic treatment has been investigated in a patient population of elderly breast cancer patients. The conclusions were that the combination of letrozole with metronomic cyclophosphamide was a very active scheme. In addition this was the first study demonstrating in vivo the antiangiogenic effect of metronomic scheduling. This study suggests that chemotherapy administered on a metronomic schedule targeting therefore the neo-angiogenesis could be synergistic with endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors. Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting Raf VEGFR-1 VEGFR-2 VEGFR-3 PDGFR-alfa Flt-3 c-Kit and p38. There is a strong rationale of combining different anti-angiogenic agents. At the ASCO 2007 meeting the data of a phase I study exploring the toxicity of a combination of sorafenib and bevacizumab have been presented. The results showed an increased toxicity being dose limiting in some patients. To our knowledge there are no data un activity and toxicity of adding sorafenib to metronomic chemotherapy.    ,NCT00954135
Breast Cancer,Dexrazoxane as a Protective Agent in Anthracycline Treated Breast Cancer, Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs such as dexrazoxane may protect normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. CTnT/cTnI/ANP/BNP were proved to be used as a biomarker of drug related cardiotoxicity. There are excellent correlations between the total cumulative dose of doxorubicin the severity of the resulting cardiomyopathy and the level of serum troponin-T.    ,NCT00955890
Breast Cancer,One-stage Breast Reconstruction Using Dermal Matrix/Implant Versus Two-stage Expander/Implant Procedure, Currently the two-stage tissue expander/implant (TE/I) technique is the standard breast reconstructive option for breast cancer patients selected for immediate skin-sparing mastectomy. This procedure has been demonstrated to be oncologically safe in patients with specific criteria for early stage breast cancer. The primary drawback however is that it requires two separate procedures under general anesthesia and multiple office visits for expander inflation to create the breast mound. Acellular dermal matrix has gained widespread acceptance for use in breast reconstruction and other areas and has the potential to provide support to the breast implant without tissue expansion in a one-stage procedure. The purpose of the study is to test this new procedure and to evaluate the impact of one-stage breast reconstruction using acellular dermis compared to the standard two-stage expander/implant technique on measures of patient satisfaction and quality of life.    ,NCT00956384

Breast Cancer,Comparison Study of Breast Computed Tomography (CT) With Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Lay Summary After patients are diagnosed with breast cancer they undergo breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to determine if the cancer is located in more than one place in the breast. Breast MR imaging is a good option for this test because it has very high sensitivity (catches almost all breast tumors). However breast MR is slow: it takes about two minutes to acquire one image and is very low resolution. The points that make up the breast MR image are around 1 to 3 mm in size. Dedicated breast computed tomography (or breast CT) a new way of imaging the breast has been introduced in the last few years. Breast CT is an x-ray exam that uses 3D imaging to show the breast in its real three dimensional shape. Combined with the use of special chemicals called iodine contrast enhancement breast CT can provide images of both the anatomy and the blood flow in the breast. As opposed to breast MR breast CT is very fast. An image can be taken in 10 seconds and has very high resolution. The points in the breast CT image are only 0.14 mm in size. The investigators propose to use breast CT instead of breast MR imaging to determine if the patient's breast cancer is located in more than one place. This is the first time anybody has proposed to use breast CT for this so the investigators aim to test the feasibility of the idea with only 6 patients. Since the patients will undergo breast MR as part of the standard of care the investigators will be able to compare the breast CT images to the current standard breast MR. This work will lay a foundation for performing this very important test before breast cancer treatment planning with a new fast high resolution imaging method breast CT.    ,NCT00957099
Breast Cancer,A Translational Trial on Molecular Markers and Functional Imaging to Predict Response of Preoperative Treatment of Breast Cancer Early, Patients with localized primary breast cancer including inflammatory breast cancer suitable for primary medical treatment and/or regional lymph node metastases receive six cycles of chemotherapy with epirubicin and docetaxel. Treatment evaluations are performed after the second fourth and sixth cycle. In case of SD/PR after the second course bevacizumab is added to the combination for the remaining four courses. Besides standard response evaluation clinically and by mammography and ultrasound several functional imaging techniques including MR CT-PET and contrast-enhanced ultrasound are investigated. Fresh tumor tissue samples from the primary tumor are collected before start after two courses and in connection with surgery. The aim of the trial is to detect biological factors and functional imaging techniques with the ability to predict response at an early stage of treatment.    ,NCT00957125
Breast Cancer,Breast Computed Tomography (CT) as a Diagnostic Tool," Lay Summary The American Cancer Society has recommended that all women over the age of 40 have an annual mammogram for many years. This recommendation has been associated with a substantial decrease in breast cancer deaths. When something suspicious is seen in one of these mammograms the woman is called back to the clinic for more imaging tests to better determine if that suspicious feature might be breast cancer. These additional imaging tests include repeated mammograms magnification mammograms and/or ultrasound. Depending on what is seen in these images the radiologist will provide a diagnosis that the suspicion is probably cancer probably benign or that the suspicion is a ""false alarm."" If it is a false alarm then the woman is sent home and she should come back after a year for another standard annual mammogram. If the diagnosis is that it is probably benign then the woman should come back after 6 months so that the suspicion can be tested again. If the diagnosis is that it is probably cancer the woman is recommended to have a biopsy so that the cancer can be confirmed. Both fortunately and unfortunately 80% of the biopsies turn out to be ""false alarms."" Although confirming that a woman does not have cancer is always a very good thing having put her through the anxiety expense and risk of a biopsy for what turned out to be nothing should be avoided. Therefore it would be desirable to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies that are performed. Dedicated breast computed tomography (or breast CT) a new way of imaging the breast has been introduced in the last few years. Breast CT is an x-ray exam that uses 3D imaging to show the breast in its real three dimensional shape. The investigators propose to use breast CT as a new better tool for the radiologist to perform the diagnosis and therefore hopefully result in fewer biopsies which should decrease the ""false alarms."" Before breast CT can be used clinically as a diagnostic tool extensive testing must be performed. In this first step the investigators propose to acquire breast CT images of only 10 patients that have been recommended to have biopsies to see if the radiologist would have arrived at a different diagnosis if he/she had based his/her decision on the breast CT images. Since this has never been attempted before this is an initial small study to test the feasibility of this method.    ",NCT00957307
Breast Cancer,Comparison Study of Breast Tomosynthesis Slice Thicknesses," Early diagnosis is one of the most important factors in the survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. To aid in the early detection of breast cancer a new technology called tomosynthesis imaging is being developed. The idea behind tomosynthesis imaging is to ""look"" at the breast from different points of view by obtaining x-ray flat images from different angles while the breast does not move and then mathematically combine these flat images into a three-dimensional image. The benefit of these three dimensional images is that the radiologist can look at the different tissues of the breast in their real positions as opposed to all the tissues being ""flattened"" into a flat image like that of a normal mammogram. Since tomosynthesis images of the breast show the tissues in their real position the radiologist should be able to more easily find a tumor and also be able to reduce the number of time he or she thinks there is a tumor present when in reality there is not one there. Before this new technology can be used in the clinic routinely it is necessary to perform a large number of studies to find the optimal way to use it. In this study the investigators are aiming to find how thick the slices or layers representing the breast should be in the image when shown to the radiologist. The difference between these two thicknesses in how useful the images are to the radiologist could be important. The investigators are trying to determine if slicing the image of the breast into thicker slices will make the job of the radiologist easier or not when deciding to recommend or not a biopsy (laboratory analysis) of what the previous mammogram found. To find the answer to this question the investigators will image patients with their tomosynthesis machine and look at the tomosynthesis images with the thin and thick slices. The radiologists that read each image will decide if they would have recommended the patient to get a biopsy based only in each of these images. The recommendations based on the images with thin slices and the recommendations based on the images with thick slices will be compared with what was actually recommended using the standard clinical tests. The investigators hope to find that the thicker slices help more than the thinner slices when trying to decide if biopsy is needed or not.    ",NCT00957567

Breast Cancer,Effects of Internet Support for Cancer Patients, Being diagnosed and treated for cancer is usually associated with severe physical symptoms impaired functional status complex emotional psychosocial and existential issues and substantial worries. Failure to help patients with their problems and worries can unnecessarily delay patients' recovery and rehabilitation lead to chronic functional impairments anxiety and depression and prolong patients' needs for health care and social services. The objectives of this interdisciplinary international research project that includes collaboration with HELFO (The Norwegian Health Economy Administration) are to test and compare in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) the effects of (1) a practice-integrated online patient-provider communication (OPPC) service including access to asking questions to HELFO (2) a multi-component Interactive Health Communication Application (IHCA) called WebChoice and (3) usual care on: patient outcomes health care and social services use and costs. Breast cancer patients undergoing treatment at three different hospitals in Norway will be randomized into two experimental and one control groups and will be followed with 5 repeated measures over one year. The proposed study will contribute to innovative methods and technologies that can radically improve patient-provider communication care quality and continuity of care. The two interventions tested in this study the OPPC service with and without additional features of WebChoice represent new forms of interactions and information sharing between patients and clinicians where patients can get seamless access to communication and information services from where and whenever they need it. This could significantly contribute to reducing unnecessary suffering less fragmented health care better efficiency patient safety patient satisfaction and have an impact on patients' health services utilization.

Breast Cancer,A Multi Modality Surveillance Program for Women At High Risk for Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to develop a coordinated standardized screening program for the early detection of breast cancer in high-risk women. This would include Breast Mammography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination of your breasts. The University of Chicago Department of Radiology is performing research to develop better ways of imaging the breast. The investigators would like to be able to reliably identify abnormal tissue and determine whether abnormal areas contain cancer without surgical procedures (i.e. a biopsy which involves removing breast tissue with a needle or surgical instrument). Annual mammography has already been recommended for the patient based on family history or personal history of cancer. In young women dense breasts sometimes make it difficult to find abnormal changes on breast cancer screening (mammograms). MRI in combination with mammography may increase the rate of detection of early cancers. In addition MRI can provide better images of breast tissue. The investigators hope to prove that combining multiple screening measures including biomarkers improves the chances that if you have a small cancer or pre-cancer it will be found early. This study will also evaluate quality of life measures during breast cancer screening and compare breast MRI and mammogram in a high-risk population. The investigators will establish a database of clinical characteristics blood biomarkers and interventions that will be saved for future analysis and aid in the development of more effective screening in high-risk women. This research will also help us develop tools for studies in the future.    ,NCT00989638
Breast Cancer,Mindfulness and Cancer Mamma - Clinical Trial MBSR Among Women Operated for Breast Cancer, The number of Danish women treated for breast cancer rise every year though survival rates have improved women can still expect to experience the diverse late effects reported by this group of patients. Mindfulness labels the ability to be aware of the present moment - thereby avoiding speculations about both past and present. Mindfulness based stress-reduction (MBSR) is an 8-week program covering 24 contact-hours and 45 minutes daily home practice. The program aims at developing participants' coping resources and developing participants' mindful awareness. Thus the program consists of guided meditations guided body scan(a specific awareness exercise)and through meditation yoga and psychoeducation concerning stress and stress-reactions while meditation and bodyscan is practiced at home by the use of specific audio-CDs guiding the patient. The MBSR-program have shoved promising results among patients with anxiety-disorders depression and chronic pain. Smaller studies have also found positive effects of the program among cancer patients. The investigators want to evaluate the effect of the MBSR program on levels of anxiety and depression as well as the possible influence of mindfulness training on health behaviors and existential concerns. The study are based on the following hypotheses:   -  report of anxiety and depression will decrease among cases   -  better compliance will lead to more decrease in levels of anxiety and depression   -  cases will make lifestyle changes suitable with recommendations for BC patients in post-treatment phase of the illness   -  decreased level of anxiety and depression will reflect improved spiritual well-being   -  improved spiritual wellbeing will lead to decreased report of physical symptoms All participants in this randomized controlled trial will fill out questionnaires at enrollment and as 1 6 and 12 months follow-up. Based on results from this trial clinicians and patients will be able to make decisions regarding post-treatment psychosocial intervention and researchers will have initial evidence of the effect of the intervention and thus possible indications for research on mindfulness among patients diagnosed with cancer at other stages or sites.    ,NCT00990977

Breast Cancer,Weight Fluctuation After Breast Cancer Treatment, This study aims to identify and quantify the factors associated with excess weight gain following treatment for breast cancer. It is believed that breast cancer patients gain more than 4% of their weight at diagnosis which is likely accompanied by an increase in body fat and waist circumference. It is further thought that this excess weight and increase in body fat and waist circumference are associated to tumour characteristics chemotherapy menopause status at diagnosis and the presence of genes related to obesity. It is also thought that women treated with chemotherapy have higher levels of glucose and insulin.    ,NCT00991653
Breast Cancer,VEGF Early Imaging for Breast Cancer, Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women. Yearly around 12500 Dutch women are diagnosed with breast cancer and 3500 die of this disease. One of the problems leading to such striking effect refers to late tumor detection due to inadequate sensitivity of current imaging techniques. Current screening is performed by means of mammography consisting of traditional film-screen mammograms of digital mammograms. These digital mammograms offer digital enhancement to aid interpretation which is especially helpful in women with dense breast tissue. Screening mammography is nowadays the single most effective method of early breast cancer detection. For screening of high risk individuals increasingly the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique is emerging. However none of the above mentioned techniques has an optimal sensitivity and specificity leading for instance to a significant portion of false positive results. The clinical consequence of this error is that additional tests and procedures are performed in women who may not have cancer. In the United States for example 11% mammograms require additional evaluation; the lesion turns out to be benign in more than 90% of cases [1]. False-positive readings False positive readings are more common in younger women both because the tests are less specific and because breast cancer is less common [23]. As a result more follow-up procedures including invasive procedures such as biopsies will be done in younger women even though fewer cancers will be found. Furthermore because breast cancer screening occurs repeatedly the risk of a false-positive study is likely to rise with repeated screening [4]. Emerging adjuncts to mammography include ultrasonography which is helpful for further assessment of known areas of interest and magnetic resonance imaging. Image-guided biopsy - directed by ultrasonography or stereotactic mammography views - plays a critical role in histological confirmation of suspected breast cancer.    ,NCT00991978

Breast Cancer,ERB-B4 After Treatment With HDAC Inhibitor in ER+ Tamoxifen Refractory Breast Cancer, The long-term objective of this research is to understand the molecular mechanisms of acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer. Identifying these mechanisms is critical to the implementation of novel therapeutic strategies that can target and overcome altered gene networks involved in controlling breast cancer progression. While patients with tumors over expressing HER1 2 or 3 have been shown to have reduced survival patients with those tumors which overexpressed HER4 (erbB4) had increased survival (Witton 2003). This is a non-randomized single-arm proof of principle trial. Selected are patients with advanced-stage breast cancer whose tumors are ER+ tamoxifen refractory. Histologically proven diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic breast cancer is advanced cancer for which there is no treatment available which would have a reasonable chance of cure. Treatment failure is defined as tumor progression after chemotherapy and tamoxifen therapy. Patients will be given five 30mg doses of HDAC inhibitor (LBH) over a period of two weeks. A dose will be taken on Days 1358 and 10. Patients will have a diagnostic tumor biopsy prior to drug administration and a diagnostic biopsy within 48 hours (2 days) of the last dose. Primary endpoints are measured by biopsy of palpable tumor with immunohistochemical staining for ERBB4. Secondary end points include the evaluation of cell death apoptosis with immunohistochemical staining for DNA breaks by TUNEL assay.    ,NCT00993642

Method: The investigators have conducted a randomized trial on 94 patients (1 male 93 females mean age 64.7 years) who presented to the investigators unit with operable breast carcinoma. Patients in group A (38 cases) were operated on using exclusively the ultrasonic knife. Patients in group B (56 cases) were operated on using the conventional diathermy knife.    ,NCT00996632
Breast Cancer,Genomic Structural Variation in Cancer Susceptibility, This study will look for new types of gene changes that may be related to cancer in some patients. Some gene changes (mutations) are passed on from parents to offspring (child). Other gene changes are new and are seen for the first time in a child. They are not seen in the parent. Some of these gene changes may cause cancers in the offspring. We will look for gene changes by studying patients with cancer their parents and family members without cancer. In this study we will be able to find gene changes that occur in the cancer patient but not in the rest of the family. Knowing the role that new gene changes play in cancer risk may help us find people at a higher risk of getting cancer.    ,NCT00996710

Per the new FDA Guidance document for FFDM accuracy in comparison to Screen-film is no longer required.    ,NCT00999596
Breast Cancer,Extension Study of Lapatinib Plus Herceptin With or Without Endocrine Therapy, Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in the U.S. Targeted therapies such as tamoxifen have been revolutionary in reducing tumor recurrences and mortality in early breast cancer. Using this successful paradigm there has been a continued search for other targeted biologic therapies directed at receptors with known potential for promoting tumor growth. The estrogen receptor (ER) and/or the HER signaling pathways are the dominant drivers of cell proliferation and survival in the majority of human breast cancers. Molecular targets of these pathways provide the most effective therapies in appropriately selected patients. However de novo and acquired resistance remain major obstacles to successful treatment and understanding the molecular pathways responsible for this resistance would enable the discovery of new strategies to overcome it. The superiority of multi-drug HER2-targeted therapy over single agent therapy has been demonstrated in the preclinical setting using mouse xenografts. Trastuzumab pertuzumab lapatinib and gefitinib represent a group of therapeutic agents that target the HER family by different molecular mechanisms. Used as single agents in the MCF7/HER2-18 xenograft model these drugs restored or enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen. However tumor growth inhibition lasted only 2-3 months before resistance to treatments occurred. However when gefitinib a HER1 inhibitor was added to the two-antibody (T+P) regimen to block signals from HER1 dimers a complete disappearance of nearly all xenograft tumors was observed; moreover there was evidence of complete tumor eradication in 50% of the mice. The combination of lapatinib + trastuzumab was also highly effective in eradication of tumor burden with no evidence of re-growth after 200 days. These xenograft models demonstrate that multi-drug HER2-targeted therapy more effectively induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation thereby resulting in tumor regression. Furthermore HER2 combination therapy appears to more effectively reduce levels of phosphorylated pAKT and MAPK thus resulting in sustained tumor inhibition.    ,NCT00999804

Breast Cancer,ABT-888 and Temozolomide for Metastatic Breast Cancer and BRCA1/2 Breast Cancer, The purpose of this research study is to find out if the combination of ABT-888 and temozolomide is safe and effective in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer. ABT-888 works by obstructing a DNA enzyme called poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) which helps repair cancer cells damaged by chemotherapy. By blocking the PARP enzyme the cancer cells are unable to repair themselves and as a result die. The other drug in this study is temozolomide. Temozolomide is designed to damage DNA in order to prevent cancer cells from reproducing. Because PARP inhibitors such as ABT-888 prevent cancer cells from repairing their own DNA they enhance the potential of chemotherapy therapy like temozolomide to induce cell death. The combination of ABT-888 and temozolomide has been used in a clinical trial for treatment of other cancers and information for this research study suggests that the combination may help to inhibit growth in breast cancer. ONLY THE EXPANSION COHORT BELOW IS RECRUITING: BRCA CARRIER EXPANSION COHORT: The purpose of the expansion cohort is to further evaluate the activity and safety of this combination in BRCA mutation carriers with metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT01009788

Breast Cancer,Paclitaxel Carboplatin and Panitumumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel and carboplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies such as panitumumab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Other find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving panitumumab together with paclitaxel and carboplatin may be a better way to block tumor growth. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well paclitaxel and carboplatin together with panitumumab works in treating patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.    ,NCT01009983
Breast Cancer,Valproic Acid in Combination With FEC100 for Primary Therapy in Patients With Breast Cancer, The drugs FEC 100 (5-fluorouracil epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) are one of the approved options to treat Locally Advanced or Primary Metastatic Breast Cancer. In this study the investigators will add another drug called Valproic Acid (VPA) to see whether this makes the treatment better. The addition of Valproic Acid to chemotherapy has been studied in about 65 subjects with cancer and was found to be safe and tolerable. Valproic Acid is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of seizures mood swings and migraine headaches. It is not currently approved for cancer which is why the investigators are conducting this study. The results of a Phase I study of Valproic Acid and FEC100 in subjects with cancer that has spread has led the investigators to believe that this combination is better than just the standard treatment alone. The investigators are now testing the combination in a study with subjects who have either a large tumor many lymph nodes involved or patients whose tumor has spread. In addition to the treatment a main goal of the study is to find out which subjects will benefit from this combination. In the Phase I trial the investigators noticed that while this combination appears to make the chemotherapy more effective it did not appear to cause more side effects induced by the chemotherapy.    ,NCT01010854

A number of potential anti-cancer nutrients have been proposed however it is important that diet supplements be evaluated prior to general recommendation. The risk of breast and ovarian cancer in carriers of a BRCA1 mutation might be lowered by some nutritional supplements. For example green tea broccoli and vitamin D are of potential interest. One dietary supplement that is thought to have potential for BRCA1 carriers is diindolylmethane (DIM) which is an active ingredient in broccoli and other green vegetables. DIM - is found in vegetables like broccoli and is available as a supplement in health food stores. The investigators think that DIM may increase the production of the normal copy of BRCA1 and offset the effect of the mutation. The purpose of this study is to determine that there is a potential for oral DIM supplementation to result in the increased production of the BRCA1 protein in BRCA1 mutation carriers. The results of the study will also serve as an evaluation of the current use and success of preventive strategies for BRCA1 mutation carriers.    ,NCT01022333

Breast Cancer,A Study of a Combination of Trastuzumab and Capecitabine With or Without Pertuzumab in Patients With HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (PHEREXA), This randomized two-arm study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a combination of trastuzumab and capecitabine with or without pertuzumab in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. The study population consisted of female patients whose disease had progressed during or following previous trastuzumab therapy for metastatic disease. All patients in Arm A and Arm B received trastuzumab (8 mg/kg iv as loading dose and then 6 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks thereafter) and capecitabine oral twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks (1250 mg/m2 twice daily in Arm A and 1000 mg/m2 twice daily in Arm B). In addition patients in Arm B received pertuzumab (840 mg iv as loading dose and then 420 mg iv thereafter) every 3 weeks. Study treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.    ,NCT01026142

Breast Cancer,Regenerative Tissue Matrix for Breast Reconstruction, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of Alloderm tissue regenerative matrix used in many breast reconstruction operations. When this material is used in the abdomen it often stretches and sometimes needs to be replaced. Although we see good clinical results when used for breast reconstruction there is no research regarding if or how the material changes in this location. The Alloderm is placed in the breast at the time the expander is placed post-mastectomy. The expansion is started at the time of surgery and completed during a series of office visit. This process stretches the skin underlying muscle and presumably the Alloderm. The goal of this study is to better understand the natural history of this material when used for breast reconstruction. Our objective is to measure changes in the dimension of the tissue matrix material after it has been placed in the breast. These objective findings will be supplemented with a patient questionnaire specifically designed for breast surgery patients. All patients will receive the standard preoperative work up intraoperative procedures and postoperative care indicated for patients undergoing implant breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Some of these patients will require use of the Alloderm to reconstruct the lower half of the breast pocket. This is already being done by plastic surgeons here at Henry Ford Hospital. The difference will be that the Alloderm tissue matrix used to reconstruct the lower part of the breast pocket for the study patients will have 4 millimeter metallic clips placed in it. Postoperatively these clips will be tracked by ultrasound done in the clinic. As the breast implant is normally expanded by adding saline we believe the Alloderm matrix will stretch. The movement of these imperceptible clips will be tracked and measured to map the expansion of the matrix in response to the underlying implant stretching the overlying breast pocket and the skin envelope. The pattern of expansion will allow us to develop a mathematical model to describe the stretch pattern of Alloderm matrix used in breast reconstruction. This information will be supplemented with a validated questionnaire specifically designed by breast surgery patients. This will give us both an objective dimensional change in the breast reconstruction as well as a patient-centered evaluation of the reconstruction process.    ,NCT01027637
Breast Cancer,Effect of Surgery and Radiation Therapy on Tc-99M Sestamibi Uptake Patterns in Molecular Breast Imaging, The investigators hope to prove that radiation and surgical scarring does not result in changes that affect the MBI pattern 6-12 months after completion of treatment.    ,NCT01027767
Breast Cancer,Study to Assess Effect of 8 Wks of Duloxetine Therapy on Breast Cancer Patients With Aromatase-Inhibitor Associated Pain, Many women with breast cancer who are treated with aromatase inhibitor medications develop aches and pains during treatment and some develop numbness and tingling in their hands and feet. Some examples of aromatase inhibitor medications include anastrozole (Arimidex) exemestane (Aromasin) and letrozole (Femara). Frequently pain medications do not work very well to relieve the pain. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) is a medication that was originally developed to treat depression. It has also been found to relieve pain that occurs in people with diabetes fibromyalgia arthritis and other painful conditions. In this study we are testing to see if duloxetine will help treat the pain that can occur in women treated with aromatase inhibitors.    ,NCT01028352

In addition we will determine the effect of pre-treatment physical functioning on physical recovery after the course of adjuvant chemotherapy. The secondary objective of this study is to explore if factors other than chronological age (functional status co-morbid medical conditions nutritional status psychological state cognitive function and social support) predicts which patients are more likely to experience morbidity (defined as grade 3-5 toxicity hospitalization dose reduction or delay or premature discontinuation of chemotherapy course) from adjuvant chemotherapy.    ,NCT01030250
Breast Cancer,Cyclophosphamide Methotrexate and Fluorouracil With or Without Epirubicin Hydrochloride in Treating Women Who Have Undergone Surgery for Breast Cancer (Group III Closed to New Patients as of 12/7/2009), RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide methotrexate fluorouracil and epirubicin hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving cyclophosphamide together with methotrexate and fluorouracil before after or without epirubicin hydrochloride is more effective in treating patients with breast cancer that can be removed by surgery. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing three regimens of cyclophosphamide given together with methotrexate and fluorouracil with or without epirubicin hydrochloride to see how well it works in treating women who have undergone surgery for breast cancer. (Group III was closed to new patients as of 12/7/2009.)    ,NCT01031030

Researchers will compare the images taken using the PEMFlex Solo II to the images taken during your scheduled routine PET/CT scan as well as any additional routine CT scan(s) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan(s) and/or ultrasound image(s) you may have had within the last 30 days or may have in the next 30 days.    ,NCT01031238
Breast Cancer,Cisplatin Paclitaxel and Everolimus in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cisplatin and paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving cisplatin and paclitaxel together with everolimus may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving cisplatin and paclitaxel together with everolimus and to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT01031446

Breast Cancer,Multi-Media Imagery Program for Breast Cancer Patients (Phase II)," Global Objective: To improve quality of life and reduce stress for breast cancer survivors. To address the late-term and long-term effects of breast cancer treatment as defined by the Institute of Medicine including chemo brain fatigue sleep deprivation stress anxiety depression and PTSD. Phase II Aims: (1) To demonstrate the clinical efficacy (i.e. improved quality of life stress reduction participant satisfaction with product) of the ""Envision the Rhythms of Life"" program and (2) to establish the technical merits of the program's distance-delivery (videoconferencing hardware and software) and instructional technology (i.e. animations graphically enhanced PowerPoint instructional materials full-color program manuals art-as-imagery and audio-imagery). ""Envision the Rhythms of Life"" instructs breast cancer survivors in the practice of individualized emotionally supportive and biologically accurate imagery and consists of 5 4-hour long interactive classes and between-class instructor support. Instructional Options: Option 1 delivers the program technology (animations PowerPoint manuals art audio-art) with instructor and participants in the same room. Option 2 delivers the program at-a-distance to a small group of via videoconferencing software and camera systems (Alaska and Seattle) to low moderate or high bandwidth areas. Each option delivers program three times (total of 45 participants for each option). A website portal provides all program information and materials. Design and Method: Program will be delivered to 135 breast cancer survivors who have completed conventional care (surgery radiation IV chemotherapy) for at least six weeks. Differences in option 1 and 2 outcomes will be compared to each other and to controls; combined outcomes of option 1 and 2 will be compared to controls; and waitlist control outcomes will be compared to their extended baseline. Hypothesis: Options 1 and 2 will both produce significantly better outcomes than waitlist control group.    ",NCT01034215
Breast Cancer,Women At Risk: The High Risk Breast Cancer Program, The purpose of this study is to increase understanding of women who are at high risk for developing breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,Observation Only Study Involving Participants Enrolled in the CHAT Trial," The aim of the CHAT study (""An open-label randomized Phase II study of Herceptin (trastuzumab) Taxotere® (docetaxel) and Xeloda (capecitabine) in combination versus Herceptin (trastuzumab) plus Taxotere® (docetaxel) in patients with advanced and/or metastatic breast cancers that overexpress HER2"") was to test the combination of Trastuzumab and Docetaxel with or without capecitabine as first-line therapy for HER2 positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Overall Response Rate was the primary endpoint of the CHAT study. This study failed to meet its primary objective of showing a difference between the treatment groups with equivalent high response rates for the Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel and Trastuzumab Docetaxel plus capecitabine arms. Secondary endpoints in the CHAT study were Progression-Free-Survival Time-to-Progression Overall Survival duration of response and safety profile. Whilst analysis of the existing data is consistent with improvement with the triplet therapy interpretation is compromised by the relatively short median follow-up of 24 months. In hindsight the statistical design was flawed by selection of a sub optimal primary endpoint and consequently data was collected and analysed early in relation to time-dependent endpoints. Beyond CHAT will permit capture of mature data for time-related endpoints. Time-to-Progression and Overall Survival are the co-primary endpoints for the Beyond CHAT protocol. The impact of treatment following the first progression on survival will be explored. Time-to-Progression will be defined from the time interval between the date of randomisation and the occurrence of progressive disease under therapy according to RECIST criteria. Overall Survival will be defined as the time from date of randomisation to date of death    ",NCT01038466

Breast Cancer,Proteomics Research of Breast Cancer Markers in Interstitial Fluid and Serum, The current study is a case control study involving comparisons of tissue interstitial fluid from breast cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissue as well as that from benign breast lesion and its adjacent non-diseased tissue for a distinguishable breast cancer profile. The purpose of this research is to collect fresh breast nodule/cancer and surrounding non-cancerous tissue for proteomic studies of the interstitial fluid to identify a profile distinguishing breast cancer which will also permit future research on stored interstitial fluid blood or tissue samples. Specific markers identified from interstitial fluid study will be investigated in blood samples to develop serum markers for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Additionally we will perform both prospective and retrospective research on breast cancer involving clinical demographic epidemiologic information treatment follow-up and outcomes on breast nodule/cancer cases collected.    ,NCT01042548
Breast Cancer,Study of XL147 (SAR245408) in Combination With Trastuzumab or Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab in Subjects With Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Progressed on a Previous Trastuzumab-based Regimen, Phase 1 of this study will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of XL147 when given in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel. After the MTD is established for each combination (Phase 2) subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of these combinations in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. Both trastuzumab and paclitaxel are used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) but patients can develop resistance. The link between PI3K mutations and trastuzumab resistance has been seen in breast cancer patients. This suggests that inhibitors of the PI3K/PTEN pathway may have the potential to restore sensitivity to trastuzumab. Similarly introduction of activated mutant forms of PI3K has been shown to transform and confer paclitaxel resistance to immortalized breast epithelial cells. XL147 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K and inhibits phosphorylation of multiple downstream components of PI3K/PTEN signaling. Therefore XL147 may have utility in the treatment of trastuzumab resistant/refractory and HER2-positive MBC when administered in combination with trastuzumab alone or with trastuzumab and paclitaxel.    ,NCT01042925
Breast Cancer,Curcumin for the Prevention of Radiation-induced Dermatitis in Breast Cancer Patients, Ionizing radiation is a toxic agent and widely accepted form of treatment for various types of cancer. Despite advances in medical technology radiation therapy still causes severe early and late skin effects. Radiation-induced dermatitis occurs in approximately 80% of patients. Important consequences of radiation-induced dermatitis include impairment of the quality of a patient's life due to pain and premature interruption of radiation treatment which in turn may be impair good local control of disease. The biological pathways responsible for acute radiation-induced dermatitis remain unclear. Currently there is no standard treatment for the prevention of radiation-induced dermatitis with demonstrated effectiveness. The aim of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study is to assess the effectiveness of curcumin for the prevention of acute radiation-induced dermatitis during postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer. We hypothesize that curcumin a natural phenolic compound found in both turmeric and curry powders can prevent or alleviate radiation-induced skin reactions in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.    ,NCT01042938

Breast Cancer,X-Ray Mammography Standard of Care Protocol, Background:   -  X-ray mammography is the standard method for breast cancer screening. It is a noninvasive test using x-rays to take pictures of breast tissue and detect any abnormalities.   -  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center has a breast imaging unit that has been accredited by the American College of Radiology. To maintain accreditation the unit must recruit a certain number of women to have clinical mammograms each year in order to maintain a high level of clinical skills and experience for the radiologists and technologists. Objectives: - To create a state-of-the-art mammography unit at the NIH Clinical Center in order to maintain American College of Radiology accreditation of the NIH breast imaging facility. Eligibility: - Women who are eligible for breast cancer screening because of family cancer history genetic test results or previous instances of cancer. Participants may not be pregnant or nursing at the time of the screening. Design:   -  Participants will provide a brief medical history on arrival at the NIH breast imaging unit.   -  Each participant will have a standard mammogram performed by a radiology technician.   -  If the study is normal participants will be told that no further evaluation will be performed. If the results indicate a need for further imaging or tissue biopsy participants may elect to return to the care of their primary physician or to receive further follow-up at the NIH Clinical Center.    ,NCT01052740
Breast Cancer,Facilitating Physical Activity Behavior and Health Outcomes in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy, Breast cancer and its treatments can take a toll on the physical and psychosocial well-being of cancer survivors. Few interventions can help breast cancer patients improve their physical strength stamina and overall well-being. Developing ways to facilitate PA behavior during chemotherapy for breast cancer are necessary. This trial explores ways that breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy can learn about and engage in PA during chemotherapy. This trial will also give Southern Alberta breast cancer survivors an opportunity to participate in evidence-based programs designed to facilitate their health breast cancer recovery and disease-free survival. The investigators primary hypothesis is that women receiving the PA intervention resource kit will report a more positive change in self-reported PA at the end of chemotherapy treatments when compared to the group receiving standard materials.    ,NCT01053468
Breast Cancer,To Evaluate the Characteristics of a Breast Cancer, The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the prevalence of markers of chronic and cycling hypoxia and reactive species stress (oxidative and nitrosative) in the breast cancer tumor microenvironment. The study is based around four cornerstone features of the pathologic microenvironment - Hypoxia Reactive Species (reactive oxygen and nitrogen species) HIF-1 and VEGF which we term the HRHV axis. Fifty breast cancer patients with planned surgical excision will be administered the hypoxia marker drug EF5 24-36 hr prior to surgical excision. EF5 is a non-therapeutic drug and provides no direct benefit to those patients enrolled in this pilot study. Tissues obtained intra-operatively will be snap frozen and subsequently analyzed for EF5 binding. Immunohistochemical analysis of a cohort of immunohistochemical and urine markers that depict the HRHV axis will be examined. The association of the markers with the presence of hypoxia as determined by EF5 positivity will be determined. Data from this pilot study will be used to establish the prevalence of markers of the HRHV axis in breast cancer. This information will be crucial for future human trials in which the HRHV axis is therapeutically targeted.    ,NCT01055678

Breast Cancer,The Clinical and Biochemical Effect of Therapeutic Massage on Fatigue and Insomnia in Women With Breast Cancer Receiving Radiation Therapy, A majority of women with breast cancer receive radiation therapy and many of them experience the debilitating side effects of fatigue and insomnia. There is a need for an effective treatment that could ameliorate these symptoms and improve quality of life in the radiation therapy population. The primary purpose of the proposed research is to study the impact of massage therapy as a tool for the management of fatigue and insomnia experienced by women diagnosed with breast cancer and receiving radiation therapy. The secondary purpose is to explain at the biochemical level the effect of therapeutic massage on the level of fatigue and insomnia in radiation therapy patients. Prior studies have shown an association between fatigue and insomnia in the breast cancer patient following radiation therapy and the presence of inflammation as evidenced by increased proinflammatory cytokine production. The investigators hypothesize that therapeutic massage will ameliorate the symptoms of fatigue and insomnia associated with radiation therapy and will be associated with a reduction in the plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6)soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R/CD126) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). This reduction in proinflammatory biomarkers will be due to the activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway via the activation of the vagus nerve.    ,NCT01071109
Breast Cancer,Extended Adjuvant Treatment With Letrozole in Breast Cancer Who Complete 5 Years of Toremifene, The purpose of this study is to assess Efficacy and Safety of Extended Adjuvant Treatment With Letrozole in Postmenopausal Women With Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer Who Complete 5 Years of Toremifene    ,NCT01072318

Breast Cancer,Study to Compare Zoladex??10.8 mg With Zoladex 3.6 mg in Pre-menopausal Women With Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety as well as the characteristics of the female hormone and study medications after administration in pre-menopausal women with advanced or recurrent breast cancer who were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either of the two treatment groups; the ZD9393 3.6 mg depot group or ZD9393 10.8 mg depot group both given in combination with tamoxifen tablets.    ,NCT01073865
Breast Cancer,Measuring Musculoskeletal Symptoms in Patients Receiving Aromatase Inhibitors, Current guidelines recommend endocrine treatment with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Musculoskeletal symptoms are commonly reported with AI treatmenthowever we do not have consistent methods to measure these symptoms prospectively. This gap in our knowledge inhibits the ability to test and develop treatments for AI-associated musculoskeletal symptoms. This pilot study will evaluate functional tests and standardized instruments for their ability to prospectively assess musculoskeletal symptoms in women being treated with AIs for breast cancer.    ,NCT01074320
Breast Cancer,PARP Inhibition for Triple Negative Breast Cancer (ER-/PR-/HER2-)With BRCA1/2 Mutations, The purpose of this trial is to evaluate 2-year disease-free survival in this patient population treated with single agent cisplatin and patients treated with cisplatin in combination with Rucaparib following preoperative chemotherapy. Side effects and tolerability of this treatment in patients with residual disease following preoperative chemotherapy will also be observed and characterized.    ,NCT01074970
Breast Cancer,Study of Tamoxifen Dose Escalation in Breast Cancer Patients With CYP2D6 Polymorphisms, Tamoxifen is an important drug for the treatment of breast cancer. Used adjuvantly after operation in early breast cancer tamoxifen reduces annual recurrence rate by half and cancer death by one third. Used preventatively it also reduces the risk of breast cancer by 50% in women at high risk for developing the disease Tamoxifen needs to be activated in the body to an active form called endoxifen mainly by the enzyme called CYP2D6. Patients have variable capability to activate tamoxifen due to variable function of this enzyme. Studies showed clear correlation of specific genetic variant of CYP2D6 with endoxifen blood levels. It is estimated that up to 25% Caucasian population have reduced or even absent CYP2D6 function. More recently there were studies that showed the correlation with genetic variant of CYP2D6 and breast cancer relapse in early breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. Food and Drug Authority (FDA) in America and recommended checking CYP2D6 genotype in patients receiving tamoxifen treatment but they did not specify how to interpret the genotype results and what kind actions to take in patient with adverse genotype. The aim of the investigators study is to see if increasing tamoxifen in patients with genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 will increase endoxifen level to the same range of most patients who have wild type (normal functional)CYP2D6.    ,NCT01075802
Breast Cancer,Study of Denosumab as Adjuvant Treatment for Women With High Risk Early Breast Cancer Receiving Neoadjuvant or Adjuvant Therapy (D-CARE)," Rationale: For women with early-stage breast cancer bone is a frequent site of relapse and most women with advanced breast cancer will eventually develop disease in the bone. Denosumab a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically inhibits RANK ligand may have the potential to interrupt the hypothetical ""vicious cycle"" of cancer-induced bone destruction and tumor cell expansion through the bone. It is not yet known if denosumab may prevent disease recurrence in the bone or in any other part of the body. Purpose: This randomized phase 3 trial is studying the effect of denosumab to see if it can prevent disease recurrence in the bone or in any other part of the body when it is given as adjuvant therapy for women with early-stage breast cancer who are at high risk of disease recurrence.

Breast Cancer,89Zr-trastuzumab PET for Imaging the Effect of HSP90 Inhibition, HSP90 inhibition is a potentially new targeted drug modality in the treatment of HER2 positive trastuzumab refractory breast cancer. Little is known about the pharmacodynamics of HSP90 inhibitors in vivo but non-invasive PET/CT imaging in a xenograft mouse model could visualize and quantify HER2 reduction after AUY922 treatment by 89Zr-trastuzumab PET imaging. Two doses of 50 mg/kg AUY922 resulted in a decrease in HER2 expression of approximately 50% quantified 6 days after the last administration of AUY922. Visualizing HER2 expression in breast cancer patients before and early following HSP90 inhibition by means of 89Zr-trastuzumab PET is likely to provide insight in the early in vivo effect of HSP90 inhibition and could potentially support patient tailored therapy.    ,NCT01081600
Breast Cancer,Imaging HSP90 Inhibitor AUY922 on VEGF-89ZR-bevacizumab Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Inhibition of Heat Shock Protein (HSP)90 is a new promising treatment modality for cancer patients particularly in the setting of resistance. A reliable read out system (biomarker) for the evaluation of early treatment effect is of great importance in the development of this treatment modality and could contribute to customize this treatment for individual patients. So far no reliable biomarker has been described for HSP90 effect. Visualizing the effect of HSP90 on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in vivo in the patient by whole body 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake can be of great importance in this respect and may contribute to tailored made cancer treatment. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of HSP90 inhibition by AUY922 on VEGF by means of 89ZR-bevacizumab PET.    ,NCT01081613
Breast Cancer,Study of XL147 (SAR245408) or XL765 (SAR245409) in Combination With Letrozole in Subjects With Breast Cancer, Phase 1 of this study will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of XL147 when given in combination with letrozole (Femara) and of XL765 when given in combination with letrozole. After the MTD is established for each combination (Phase 2) subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of these combinations in subjects with breast cancer refractory to a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor that is ER+/PGR+ and HER2-. Letrozole is used in the treatment of different types of breast cancer but patients can develop resistance. Upregulation of PI3K activity is one of the most common characteristics of human cancer cells including breast tumor cells. Activation of PI3K results in stimulation of AKT and mTOR kinases resulting in the promotion of tumor cell proliferation and survival. Preclinical and retrospective clinical data suggest that aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway may play a role in aromatase inhibitor resistance in patients with ER+ HER2- breast cancer. XL147 is a potent inhibitor of PI3K and XL765 is a potent dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR; therefore either of these compounds in combination with letrozole warrants clinical investigation.    ,NCT01082068
Breast Cancer,Radiation Therapy in Treating Women With Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Repeat Breast-Preserving Surgery, RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after surgery kill any remaining tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for breast cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy works in treating women with locally recurrent breast cancer previously treated with repeat breast-conserving surgery.    ,NCT01082211
Breast Cancer,Female Cancer Patients' Preference For Sexual Health Interventions, The purpose of this study is to survey female cancer patients' awareness of and preference for methods to improve sexual health. This information will help to improve our understanding of the needs and preferences for sexual health strategies and interventions of our female patients. The findings of this survey will also be used to develop feasible sexual health resources for our patients and enhance the success of grant proposals to support future sexual health interventions at MSKCC.    ,NCT01084642
Breast Cancer,Digital Mammography for the Detection and Preoperative Staging of Breast Cancer, Breast tumors are normally seen with mammography or ultrasound without the use of a dye but the size and extent of the tumor may be hard to see. Currently after initial mammography many patients undergo bilateral breast MR to further stage the local tumor. It is able to not only detect anatomic abnormalities but can also evaluate changes such as the development of new blood vessels which occurs with the development of cancers. MRI is extremely sensitive and detects unsuspected disease in up to 25% of patients which affects their treatment. It also detects unsuspected cancer in the other breast in some patients. However MRI is expensive not always available and some patients are unable to undergo MRI due to the presence of pacemakers clips or claustrophobia. Dual Energy Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammography (DE CEDM) is an investigational procedure that uses a non-standard contrast in a regular digital mammography exam that has been changed to give the needed dual energy and image. DE CEDM is not FDA approved. It is our hope that DE CEDM will also be able to detect unknown tumors because it will also detect new blood vessels. It is less expensive than MRI could be more available to patients and can be done on patients with pacemakers and clips. Claustrophobia will not be a problem. We plan to see if (DE CEDM) will help us better see the breast tumor and size of the breast tumor. We will also want to see if DE CEDM can detect additional unsuspected disease in the breast with the known tumor and in the other breast without a known tumor.    ,NCT01086514
Breast Cancer,Pixantrone Dimaleate in Treating Patients With HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as pixantrone dimaleate work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving pixantrone dimaleate in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well pixantrone dimaleate works in treating patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT01086605
Breast Cancer,A Pilot Study of F-18 Paclitaxel (FPAC) PET for Evaluating Drug Delivery of Solid Tumors in Breast Lung Renal and Adrenal Cancers, Background:   -  Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug that is commonly used to treat different types of cancers. However cancer tumors can become resistant to paclitaxel and as a result they will fail to accumulate sufficient concentrations of paclitaxel to kill the cancer cells. Researchers are interested in studying whether tumors have become resistant to paclitaxel but to do so it must be possible to see how much paclitaxel is absorbed by the tumor cells.   -  18F-Fluoropaclitaxel (FPAC) is a form of paclitaxel that has been modified to be slightly radioactive in order to show up on positron emission tomography (PET) scans. By injecting a very small amount (much less that that used to treat tumors) of the radiolabeled drug into the body researchers hope to use PET scans to evaluate the amount of the drug absorbed by solid tumors. Because FPAC is best used to study tumors located above the diaphragm all subjects in the study will have tumors near or above the diaphragm. Objectives: - To determine the safety and effectiveness of FPAC as a radiological evaluation chemical. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with breast adrenal renal or lung cancer and have a tumor located someone in the body at least 1 centimeter above the diaphragm. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam blood tests and imaging studies as directed by the study researchers.   -  Participants will receive a single dose of FPAC followed by a series of PET scans. Regular scans will be performed for 3 hours after the dose of FPAC.   -  Participants will also have a single dose of a more conventional radiotracer followed by a series of PET scans. The results of the two sets of scans will be compared with information from previous imaging studies of participants' tumors....    ,NCT01086696

Breast Cancer,A Trial Testing Professional and Peer-led Support Online Support Groups for Young Canadian Breast Cancer Survivors, Young women who have finished treatment for breast cancer regularly report a lack of psychological and social support in their lives. They often continue to struggle with survivorship issues such as ongoing distress and the challenge of how to rebuild their lives after treatment. This experiment will compare two online support group (OSG) options to determine if both forms of support help young breast cancer survivors adjust by reducing treatment-related intrusions and helping women re-engage in valued activities and commitments. It will also test if these 2 types of OSG's help womens' mood feelings of loneliness confidence and overall life satisfaction. It will explore the processes within support groups that help to create positive change for young women after cancer treatment. Previous work by this team in a smaller study has shown that online support groups led by professional counselors can be carried out over the Internet and that they produce helpful benefits for young women survivors of breast cancer. The online groups were comprised of 10 sessions of real time chats with each session focused on a specific topic. Participants were provided with an educational manual designed to improve skills for coping after cancer and they were instructed to read one chapter a week in preparation for the chats. The women enjoyed the groups and 3 months after completing the groups they reported improved quality of life lower emotional distress and enhanced coping. However a large study to determine the strength and reliability of these early promising findings is needed. The questions to be examined are whether trained peers (other young breast cancer survivors) might be able to facilitate the online groups and provide similar positive benefits for young breast cancer survivors and what facilitators can do to maximize positive benefits in online support groups. This is a multi-provincial 3-arm study that will compare a professionally-led OSG (with an educational manual) and a peer-led OSG (with an education manual) with a group that just receives the educational manual. Psychological assessment measures given immediately following the 12 week group and at 6 months and 12 months follow-up will determine if one or both of the study groups effectively improve quality of life reduce distress and enhance self-efficacy and life satisfaction for young breast cancer survivors. Additionally tests will be performed to investigate whether discussing emotional matters predicts greater improvements.    ,NCT01089699

Breast Cancer,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel fluorouracil epirubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with or without bevacizumab is more effective in treating patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy works compared with giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab in treating patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT01093235

Patients are eligible to participate in this study if they have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer and in the investigator's opinion require combination therapy for treatment of their disease. Patients will receive taxane (weekly paclitaxel or three-weekly docetaxel) and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks as intravenously infusion). The treatment will continue until disease progression. The target sample size is < 100 patients.    ,NCT01094184
Breast Cancer,Trial of Vinflunine Plus Capecitabine in Advanced Breast Cancer, The increasing use of anthracyclines and taxanes in the adjuvant neoadjuvant and first-line metastatic settings led to a raise of patients presenting with metastatic breast cancer after treatment with these agents. Options for the treatment of patients who have progressed after an anthracycline and a taxane are limited. The high level of in-vitro synergy of vinflunine combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) together with the good tolerance and the encouraging response rate observed while combining IV vinflunine to oral capecitabine make it a promising combination to investigate further in a phase III trial. This phase III trial will evaluate the effectiveness and the safety profile of such combination for the treatment of patient with advanced breast cancer previously treated with or resistant to anthracycline and taxane resistant.    ,NCT01095003

Breast Cancer,A Phase III Randomized Trial of Metformin vs Placebo in Early Stage Breast Cancer, This study is looking at whether Metformin an agent that is commonly used to treat diabetes can decrease or affect the ability of breast cancer cells to grow and whether Metformin will work with other therapies to keep cancer from recurring. Health Canada has not approved the sale or use of Metformin to treat breast cancer although they have approved its use in this clinical trial. Although Metformin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of diabetes its use in breast cancer is considered investigational.    ,NCT01101438
Breast Cancer,Trastuzumab or Lapatinib Ditosylate in Treating Women With Early Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether trastuzumab or lapatinib ditosylate is more effective in treating women with early breast cancer. Update June 2013: Since the initial development of EPHOS-B in 2007 more evidence in relation to safety and efficacy of anti-HER2 therapies are now available and in particular a growing body of evidence that combinations of two anti-HER2 therapies are more effective than monotherapies. Therefore this study has been amended (PART 2) to a 1:1:2 ratio to control perioperative trastuzumab or the combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying trastuzumab to see how well it works compared with lapatinib ditosylate (and in since June 2013 - Part 2 - compared with a combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab) in treating women with early breast cancer.    ,NCT01104571

Breast Cancer,Comprehensive Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Management for Oncology Practice, Cancer symptoms due to disease progression or side effects caused by cancer treatment are prevalent. Most cancer patients are treated in outpatient settings. Patients may be provided with patient education materials and counseled on anticipated side effects while being provided with different self-management options and warnings regarding when medical care is required. Despite these efforts many people feel set adrift in having to self-manage treatment and illness related symptoms at home resulting in a sense of burden for the patient and the caregiver. When the patient does visit the doctor they increasingly are asked questions to elicit information about symptoms and performance using structured questionnaires that are shown to give reproducible meaningful quantitative assessments of how patients feel and how they function?measures that are called patient reported outcomes or PROs. The questionnaires used to collect this information are called PRO instruments. The use of PRO instruments is part of a general movement toward the idea that the patient properly queried is the best source of information about how he or she feels. The goal of using PRO measures is to provide better information to doctors and patients so that the best treatment for patients can be determined. PURPOSE: To reduce the isolation of patients/caregivers from the medical care team and to improve patient/provider communication and clinical decisions by keeping documented daily reports of patient symptoms online having notifications sent to the medical team of moderate to severe symptoms and by reviewing these reports at clinic visits with the medical staff.    ,NCT01108315

Breast Cancer,Preoperative Localisation of the Sentinel Lymph Node in Breast Cancer," When a person has breast cancer it is necessary to find out whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the armpit because if it has further treatment is likely to be needed. There are many of these nodes but when the breast cancer spreads it does so in a step-by-step fashion starting with the so-called Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN). At present the only way to be sure whether there is cancer in the lymph nodes or not is to perform an operation to remove at least the SLN. If the pathologist finds cancer in the SLN a second operation is usually required to remove further nodes in case they contain cancer too. Surgical removal of the lymph nodes in the armpit can cause difficulties for the patient afterwards such as pain and swelling in the arm. If there is no cancer in the SLN no further operations on the armpit are needed. The investigators wish to find out whether in some patients operations on the armpit can be avoided completely. The first step in doing this is to test whether the investigators can find out which is the SLN before the operation using a combination of an injection and ultrasound scanning. The injection - into the skin of the breast - would be a radioactive substance which is the usual way the surgeon finds the SLN. The radioactive substance collects in the SLN and the investigators would use a ""gamma probe"" over the surface of the armpit to detect the radiation. In this initial study the investigators would aim to find the SLN before the operation and place a marker wire in it so that the surgeon could check whether the investigators had found the correct node.

Breast Cancer,Dose Optimization for Pulsed-dose-rate (PDR)/High-dose-rate (HDR) Brachytherapy Alone for Early Breast Cancer, Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) leads to a equivalent local control rate with lower toxicity as external beam irradiation (EBI) after breast conserving surgery (BCS) in a highly selected subgroup of patients with low risk invasive carcinoma and low risk duct carcinoma in-situ (DCIS). The goal of this trial is to assess the role of a modified dose of pulsed-dose-rate (PDR) and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy alone as Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) in a defined low-risk group of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ concerning local failure (all ipsilateral local recurrences) in particular regarding the local recurrences the toxicity and for the cosmetic result. It is a phase II study. According to study protocol altogether 200 female patients will be treated.    ,NCT01175694
Breast Cancer,Randomized Study of Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide With or Without Intermittent Sunitinib in the First-line Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With Measurable Primary Breast Tumor, This is a single-centre phase II randomized study of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) with or without intermittent sunitinib in patients with measurable primary breast cancer who are receiving pre-operative chemotherapy. A lead-in phase I study was built into this protocol to determine the dose and duration of sunitinib that may achieve the desired effects of normalizing tumor vasculature prior to chemotherapy administration. A total of 64 patients with measurable primary tumor will be enrolled for the Phase II part of the study. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to either arm A or arm B. Patients will be stratified according to metastatic status (metastatic vs non-metastatic) and presence or absence of clinical T4 disease. Arm A (Control arm): Doxorubicin 60mg/m2 day 1 Cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2 day1 every 3 weeks x 4 cycles Arm B (Experimental arm): Days -13 (or -7) to day 0 (total 7 or 14 days) - oral sunitinib daily (duration and dose as determined from the lead-in phase I study) Cycle 1: day 1 - Cycle 1 AC (60/600mg/m2); days 15-21 - oral sunitinib daily Cycle 2: day 1 - Cycle 2 AC (60/600mg/m2); days 15-21 - oral sunitinib daily Cycle 3: day 1 - Cycle 3 AC (60/600mg/m2); days 15-21 - oral sunitinib daily Cycle 4: day 1 - Cycle 4 AC (60/600mg/m2) DCE-MRI scan will be performed serially to determine tumor response and change in tumor vascular parameters for each enrolled subject: Patient will be evaluated weekly for toxicity assessments and full blood count during cycle 1 and on days 1 and 15 of each subsequent cycle. In addition patients in Arm B will be evaluated weekly during the first two weeks of sunitinib administration prior to cycle 1 AC.    ,NCT01176799
Breast Cancer,Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Symptom Cluster Trial for Breast Cancer Survivors, The purpose of this study among breast cancer survivors is three-fold: (i) to evaluate the efficacy of the MBSR(BC) program in improving psychological and physical symptoms quality of life and measures of immune function and a stress hormone (cortisol); (ii) to test whether positive effects achieved from the MBSR(BC) program are mediated through changes in mindfulness and fear of recurrence of breast cancer; and (iii) to evaluate whether positive effects achieved from the MBSR(BC) program are modified by specific patient characteristics measured at baseline.    ,NCT01177124
Breast Cancer,Standard Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Versus Genomic Driven Chemotherapy in Patients With Breast Cancer, This randomized trial is comparing a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a genomic driven chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.    ,NCT01180335
Breast Cancer,Rehabilitation of Cognitive Changes in Breast Cancer Survivors, The purpose of this study is to test a memory training program for breast cancer survivors who have problems with memory after receiving chemotherapy. Since breast cancer survivors have been reported to have trouble with their memory a program to help these problems is important. Studies have shown that a 5-week software training program improved memory in pediatric cancer survivors and other disorders like stroke but it has not been tested for breast cancer survivors. This study will see if breast cancer survivors can improve their memory and attention problems by using either one of two software versions of the program. One version is called Cogmed Working Memory Training and the other is a comparison version of the software that has the same exercises but is less difficult. People who decide to participate in the study will be randomly given one of the two versions.    ,NCT01182506
Breast Cancer,Lung Inflammation and Lung Metastases From Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to find out if there is a link between cigarette smoking inflammation and the spread of breast cancer to the lung. We think that women who are current or former smokers may be at increased risk for breast cancer spreading to the lung compared to women who have never smoked. Smoking causes inflammation in the lung in some women. Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering (MSKCC) think that smoking-related lung inflammation may increase the chance of breast cancer spreading to the lung. In order to find out whether inflammation plays a role in breast cancer spreading to the lung we will measure a urinary marker of lung inflammation. This will allow us to determine if this marker is more commonly elevated in women with breast cancer that has spread to the lung compared to those without breast cancer in the lung. We will also collect DNA from blood to have the opportunity to determine if there are differences in DNA in women with or without breast cancer that has spread to the other sites including the lung. We will also collect blood to determine if we can identify risk factors for the spread of breast cancer to the lungs.    ,NCT01182519

Breast Cancer,The ACTS Intervention to Reduce Breast Cancer Treatment Disparity, The 5-year survival after a first diagnosis of breast cancer is 13% lower in black than in white American women an alarming disparity that cannot be explained by stage of disease at presentation. Nonadherence to breast cancer treatment and treatment delays from diagnosis to initiation of treatment may be among the reasons for worse breast cancer outcomes in black women. This recognition is critical because it suggests that breast cancer survival disparity can be decreased through clinical interventions that increase adherence to chemotherapy. The ACTS (Attitudes Communication Treatment Support) Intervention is a onetime intensive psycho-educational intervention using a race-matched breast cancer survivor interventionist to: address Attitudes including perceptions and stressors that may impact adherence to clinical visits and treatment; encourage and model patient Communication with health care providers regarding physical and emotional needs with attention to race-discordant situations; and provide tailored understandable information about Treatment and its rationale. The Support component is threaded throughout the intervention via the presence of a race-matched breast cancer survivor and supportive video messages from the black community. This study is a randomized controlled trial that will test the efficacy of the ACTS Intervention vs. Usual Care on the primary outcomes of adherence to recommended breast cancer chemotherapy.    ,NCT01184066
Breast Cancer,Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) vs. 3D-conformal Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) for Early Stage Breast Cancer After Lumpectomy, In the setting of radiotherapy as part of breast-conservation therapy for patients with early stage breast cancer the novel planning and delivery method of intensity modulated radiotherapy is an effective and safe alternative to the commonly-used standard 3D-conformal external beam radiotherapy spares more normal breast and lung tissue and may lead to improved clinical outcomes.    ,NCT01185132

Breast Cancer,Trastuzumab and Vinorelbine in Advanced Breast Cancer, The purpose of this research study is to see what effects trastuzumab in combination with vinorelbine has on breast cancer when the participant has circulating tumor cells that are positive for the protein called HER2. Trastuzumab is an FDA approved drug that targets HER2. The drug combination of trastuzumab and vinorelbine is an effective treatment for patients with breast cancers that are positive for HER2. This trial seeks to determine if the combination can also benefit participants whose original breast cancer was HER2 negative but whose circulating tumor cells are HER2 positive.    ,NCT01185509
Breast Cancer,Trial Comparing the Effects of Linear Versus Nonlinear Aerobic Training in Women With Operable Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of 3 different approaches to exercise training in women with early stage breast cancer who have completed all primary treatments (except hormone therapy if appropriate). Prior research in women with early stage breast cancer has shown that some treatments may have an adverse impact on physical fitness levels leading to feelings of fatigue and poor quality of life. Supervised exercise training has been shown to reduce some of these side-effects. However all the exercise programs have followed essentially the same approach. This study is designed to see if a different approach to exercise training is more effective than the conventional approach currently in use.    ,NCT01186367

Breast Cancer,Efficacy and Safety Study of LEP-ETU to Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer, LEP-ETU is a novel proprietary delivery system of paclitaxel developed by NeoPharm Inc. Paclitaxel (currently marketed as Taxol) is an anti-microtubular network agent and is active in a broad spectrum of malignancies. Paclitaxel has poor solubility. In order to enhance the solubility this drug is formulated with polyoxyethylated castor oil which leading to infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions. The NeoPharm LEP-ETU is formulated with a mixture of well characterized synthetic phospholipids and cholesterol. This design eliminates the need for the oil. The LEP-ETU formulation has improved safety profile that is necessary for administering higher doses than would commonly be used with Taxol. The clinical evidence obtained from the NeoPharm Phase I study shows LEP-ETU is better tolerated than Taxol as indicated by a higher maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). The current Phase II study is designed to accomplish the following objectives:   1. Assess the Overall Response Rate (ORR) of patients with metastatic breast cancer after administered over 90 minutes at the dose of 275 mg/m2 LEP-ETU   2. To evaluate the Progression-Free Survival (PFS)   3. To evaluate the safety of LEP-ETU at 275 mg/m2 level in particular peripheral neuropathy   4. To evaluate the Overall Survival (OS)    ,NCT01190982
Breast Cancer,Pilot Study of Partial Breast Irradiation Utilizing Permanent Breast Seed Implant to Treat Breast Cancer, Background: Recent single arm studies have suggested that partial breast irradiation (PBI) delivered in a relatively short overall treatment time of a few days may be an effective alternative to adjuvant whole breast irradiation (WBI) delivered over a number of weeks. Several PBI modalities and techniques have been investigated including interstitial brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy most often given over the course of one week of twice daily outpatient treatments. One randomized study has shown equivalency between WBI and PBI using brachytherapy. There are currently three large phase-III randomized studies comparing PBI to WBI. Permanent Breast Seed Implant (PBSI) is the newest PBI technique which has been piloted at the Odette Cancer Centre (OCC) in Toronto. The main advantage of this technique is that it requires only one out-patient procedure. The treatment is administered by implanting radioactive Palladium (103Pd) seeds into the tumor bed region in a 1 to ½ hour outpatient procedure after which the patient is discharged home to resume her normal living activities. This PBI procedure was shown to be well tolerated with minimal acute toxicity. Estimated partner radiation exposure was well within internationally acceptable levels. Subjects with a seroma >2cm were however excluded. Hypothesis: PBSI is a feasible safe and acceptable treatment option for the subject and her partner in the context of medical practice and resources in BC. Objectives: In subjects who have undergone breast conserving surgery for early breast cancer:   1. To determine the technical feasibility of PBSI in BC   2. To measure the subject's partner in terms of radiation protection   3. To evaluate acceptability of PBSI by the subject   4. To assess resource requirements for PBSI Method: This is a single arm feasibility study. Five women who had undergone breast conserving surgery for breast cancer with low risk of local recurrence will be accrued. This study will adhere to a detailed written protocol for radiation measurements and protection. Subjects will undergo PBSI within 4-14 weeks from last breast surgery. The procedure will be performed in an outpatient setting under conscious sedation and local anesthesia by a team with a wide brachytherapy experience. The technique used in this feasibility study will be based on the OCC technique. It is intended that two oncologists and one physicist will spend 2-3 days at the OCC to acquire detailed and firsthand knowledge of the technique as implemented at that centre. The OCC technique is US-based; in this study however an additional CT-assisted planning component will be investigated building on the experience of the VIC team which conducted the BC Cancer Agency Vancouver Island Centre's pilot study of CT-based multi-catheter brachytherapy PBI. Systemic therapy will be according to BCCA guidelines; however subjects requiring adjuvant chemotherapy will be excluded from this study. Subjects will be followed prospectively for 5 years for evaluation of toxicity QOL and cosmesis. Disease status will be recorded. Relevance: Completing adjuvant breast irradiation with a single out-patient treatment could significantly improve QOL and convenience for patients choosing breast conserving therapy. Confirming the technical feasibility and safety of PBSI is needed before progressing to larger prospective evaluation of this novel adjuvant radiation therapy technique as a viable treatment option for women in British Columbia.    ,NCT01191164
Breast Cancer,PharmacoKINEtics of TAMoxifen and Its Metabolites in Breast Cancer Patients: the Influence of a Dose Increase in Phenotypic Poor Metabolizers of CYP2D6 (KINETAM), All women on tamoxifen receive the standard dose of 20mg QD irrespective of the use of potential CYP2D6 inhibitors and are not tested for CYP2D6 polymorphisms prior to start of tamoxifen treatment.However CYP2D6 polymorphisms and/or the use of CYP2D6 inhibitors as co-medication may influence the treatment outcome of tamoxifen. The investigators propose a prospective study in women taking tamoxifen at a dose of 20mg QD. In each woman information will be collected on endoxifen levels CYP2D6 status adherence and use of co-medication. In women who are phenotypically poor metabolizers of tamoxifen a dose increase to 40mg QD will be applied and the effect of this intervention on tamoxifen pharmacokinetics will be evaluated after 4 weeks.    ,NCT01192308
Breast Cancer,Preoperative Trial of Sorafenib in Combination With Cisplatin Followed by Paclitaxel for Early Stage Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to identify new treatment regimens with better response rates and to find out if the combination of cisplatin and sorafenib followed by paclitaxel and sorafenib can shrink the size of your breast tumor and allow you to preserve your breast. Sorafenib is a newer drug that targets blood vessel formation and may help the chemotherapy work better. Additionally by receiving chemotherapy before surgery we will be able to determine if your cancer is responsive to chemotherapy.    ,NCT01194869
Breast Cancer,Re-expression of ER in Triple Negative Breast Cancers," Patients are being asked to take part in this study because they have metastatic breast cancer that is triple negative (does not express estrogen receptor (ER) progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2). This means that agents such as trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and tamoxifen are not currently treatment options for their cancer. Another option for treating the patient's cancer at this point is with chemotherapy. The patient should discuss this and other options with their doctor prior to entering this study. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that ER is actually present in some triple negative breast cancers but is ""silenced"" (does not function properly) because methyl and histone groups are attached to it and inactivate it. Special drugs called demethylating inhibitors (such as decitabine) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (such as LBH589) can remove these methyl and histone groups and reactivate ER. This reactivated ER can then be targeted with agents like tamoxifen. The patient is being asked to join this clinical research study to find out if ER can be reactivated in their cancer using decitabine in combination with LBH589. If ER is reactivated in their cancer we will then determine if tamoxifen can decrease the growth of the cancer.    ",NCT01194908

Breast Cancer,Predictors of Ovarian Insufficiency in Young Breast Cancer Patients, More than two million American women are breast cancer survivors. Approximately one-third of these women are premenopausal at diagnosis and face issues related to reproduction as they undergo cancer treatment. Ovarian function after breast cancer diagnosis has implications on breast cancer prognosis choice of adjuvant therapy and reproductive issues such as desire for fertility or concerns about menopause. Therefore tools to accurately predict ovarian function in breast cancer survivors could significantly impact physicians and patients in counseling medical and surgical treatment choices and consideration of fertility preservation options. The goal of this proposal is to identify pre-chemotherapy hormonal genetic and ovarian imaging markers that can predict ovarian failure and characterize the course of ovarian function after chemotherapy. The investigators plan to follow a group of young women from breast cancer diagnosis to five years after chemotherapy. The investigators will study the following risk factors: blood hormone levels that reflect ovarian function genetic mutations that affect how individuals metabolize chemotherapy and ovarian size and egg count by MRI and ultrasound. The investigators hypothesize that these biomarkers are related to risk of ovarian insufficiency singly. After examining these individual risk factors for ovarian failure the investigators will put them together into an Ovarian Failure Clinical Predictive Index. This index will be a tool similar to the Gail Model that can be used to determine individual risk for ovarian failure. This tool would assist young breast cancer patients and their physicians in making treatment decisions that would impact cancer survival and reproduction.    ,NCT01197456

Breast Cancer,A Randomized Study to Determine the Efficacy of a Taxane and Bevacizumab With or Without Capecitabine as First Line Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to determine whether   -  Paclitaxel and bevacizumab showed improved PFS compared to paclitaxel alone. Recent results of the AVADO study report a similar result for the combination of docetaxel and bevacizumab. The AVADO study furthermore confirmed the dose of 15 mg/kg BW of bevacizumab.   -  As in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) poly-chemotherapies are frequently used regimens with bevacizumab and at least 2 cytotoxic agents should be investigated.   -  Docetaxel and capecitabine showed a benefit in PFS and survival. This combi- nation is therefore a reasonable choice.   -  Dose of capecitabine and docetaxel should be reduced to 1800 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 to improve tolerability without compromising efficacy.   -  Paclitaxel and capecitabine is well tolerated and showed a PFS of 10.3 months.   -  Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 as monotherapy in MBC not very often used b/o toxicity. 75 mg/m2 much more accepted in daily practice. Better comparability with DBX if both arms have 75mg/m2 docetaxel as assumed.    ,NCT01200212
Breast Cancer,A Study of Bevacizumab in Combination With Gemcitabine and Carboplatin in Participants With Triple Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer, This multicenter study will assess the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin as first line treatment in participants with triple negative metastatic breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,Partial Breast Irradiation (PBI) Using 40 Gy for Select Patients With Early Invasive or Noninvasive Breast Cancer," Currently the standard of care is to treat early stage invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with a combination of lumpectomy and radiotherapy known as ""breast-conserving therapy"" (BCT). The traditional method of giving radiation therapy after a lumpectomy is to the whole breast. However the investigators do not know if the whole breast needs to be receive radiation to better control your cancer or only a more limited area of the breast surrounding the tumor. The purpose of this study is to see the side effects of delivering partial breast irradiation (PBI) instead of whole breast irradiation (WBI). PBI is radiation therapy given only to the area of the breast where the cancer was removed. Another purpose of this study is to look long term at the rate at which cancer comes back in the same breast after PBI. WBI is radiation therapy given 5 days a week for 5 to 7 weeks to the whole breast. Partial breast irradiation radiation therapy (PBI) is much shorter than whole breast irradiation. The investigators propose to deliver the PBI radiation therapy for a few minutes a day once a day five days a week for 2 weeks. In this study the investigators will learn about the good and bad effects of PBI radiation therapy. In this study the investigators will also learn about how the breast looks after surgery and radiation therapy.    ",NCT01203839

Breast Cancer,Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Elderly Non Frail Patients With an Increased Risk for Relapse of a Primary Carcinoma of the Breast, Although approximately 50% of new diagnosis breast cancers are in patients above the age of 65 elderly people remain substantially under-represented in clinical trials and therefore are under-treated. A recent trial of the CALBG in patient's ??65 years with medium risk of breast cancer demonstrated an improved disease-free and overall survival for those treated with AC or CMF compared to those treated with capecitabine alone. The primary aim of the ICE II trial is to determine the compliance and toxicity of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (EC) or CMF versus nab-paclitaxel plus capecitabine as adjuvant therapy in non frail elderly patients.    ,NCT01204437
Breast Cancer,Randomized Study of Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Focused Microwave Thermotherapy Before Surgery in Treating Women With Large Breast Cancer Tumors, The purpose of this randomized Phase III study is to determine whether preoperative focused microwave heat treatment and chemotherapy combined are more effective than preoperative chemotherapy alone in the treatment of large breast cancer tumors in the intact breast. Combining heat with chemotherapy before surgery might shrink the tumor so that it can be removed in a breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) instead of a mastectomy.    ,NCT01204801
Breast Cancer,Brown Seaweed as a Breast Cancer Preventive, Japanese postmenopausal women in Japan have about one ninth the rate of American postmenopausal women.

Breast Cancer,Bevacizumab Docetaxel and Carboplatin in Treating Women With Stage II or Stage III Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel and carboplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with docetaxel and carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

Breast Cancer,Treated Blood Cells Cyclophosphamide Fludarabine Phosphate and Aldesleukin in Treating Patients With Cancer, RATIONALE: Placing a gene into T cells may improve the body's ability to recognize cancer cells and build an immune response to fight cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Biological therapies such as aldesleukin may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving specially treated T cells together with cyclophosphamide fludarabine phosphate and aldesleukin may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of treated T cells when given together with cyclophosphamide fludarabine phosphate and aldesleukin in treating patients with cancer.    ,NCT01212887

Breast Cancer,Phase II Study of Intra-Operative Electron Irradiation and External Beam Irradiation After Lumpectomy in Patients With T1N0M0 and T2N0M0 Breast Cancer, The study is being done to determine the tolerance to single fraction intra-operative electron irradiation (IOERT) and external beam photon irradiation (EBRT) following lumpectomy for T1/T2N0M0 breast cancer. IOERT is used in lieu of the 5-8 days of electron beam boost irradiation that is usually given after EBRT. Data from two centers as well as preliminary data from a randomized trial in Europe suggest that IOERT boost is well tolerated and efficacious. In our study patients will undergo standard lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node sampling or axillary dissection. After the lumpectomy IOERT of 10 Gy will be delivered in a single fraction to the tumor bed by a mobile electron machine in the operating room. EBRT to the whole breast will be administered once the surgical wound has healed adequately. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility and acute patient tolerance to IOERT and EBRT after lumpectomy. Secondary objectives include assessment of local control and distant control of disease as well as evaluation of long-term side effects and cosmetic outcome of the treatment.    ,NCT01215162

Breast Cancer,Telephone-Based Decision Support for Rural Patients, The investigators community based resource center has implemented visit preparation by prompting patients to write down their questions. This is a proven approach to increasing the number of questions and concerns that patients voice during their visits with doctors. The resource center's usual practice is to provide their visit preparation intervention called Consultation Planning through in-person counseling sessions. This study asks whether telephone delivery of Consultation Planning would be almost as effective in terms of increasing patient's decision self-efficacy or confidence in their ability to navigate decisions effectively with their physicians. The study also asks about the cost-effectiveness of telephone delivery compared to in-person delivery. The investigators are answering these questions through a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial with two arms: in-person versus telephone delivery of Consultation Planning. The investigators are measuring self-reported psychological outcomes such as decision self-efficacy (primary outcome) preparation for decision making anxiety and distress along with economic outcomes such as health resource utilization and willingness to pay. The investigators hypothesize that Tele-CP can be delivered at a lower patient and resource center cost than in-person CP and that it will be as effective in terms of impact on a patient's decisional self-efficacy.    ,NCT01217333
Breast Cancer,Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging in Monitoring and Predicting Response in Patients With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy Before Surgery, RATIONALE: New imaging procedures such as diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging may help measure a patient's response and allow doctors to plan better treatment.

Breast Cancer,Art Therapy Intervention for Breast Cancer Patients, As studies continue to debate the effects of quality of life on survival increased attention is being focused on investigating complementary alternative therapies to boost overall total health in cancer patients . Art therapy is an interesting growing field which has shown promise to positively influence quality of life in the pediatric and adult oncology population alike. As there is a paucity of well controlled complete studies in this field the investigators propose to study the impact of art therapy sessions in women with breast cancer with quantitative and qualitative analysis of emotional health and physical symptoms. The results of the investigators study will have widespread applicability to oncology programs that wish to offer/implement such sessions to their palliative and non-palliative outpatients in an effort to address the important concept of whole person care.    ,NCT01220960

Breast Cancer,Sentinel Lymph Node Detection After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Large Operable Breast Cancer, GANEA 2 is a new trial based on patient treated for a large breast tumor with proven axillary involved nodes. Patients enrolled in this trial will have first an axillary sonography with fine needle punction in case of suspected nodes before NAC. This primary evaluation allow to determine two groups of patients : group 1 : patients with proven involved axillary nodes and group 2 patients without proven axillary involved nodes. Patients of group 1 the study group will undergo SLNB and complete level I-II axillary lymphadenectomy. Patients of group 2 will undergo SLNB and a complete axillary level I-II lymphadenectomy only in the case of detection failure or involved SLN and a SLNB alone in the others cases. Patients of this last group will be followed 5 years in order to evaluate the risk of axillary relapse without lymphadenectomy.    ,NCT01221688
Breast Cancer,6xFU/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide (FEC) Compared to 3xFEC-3xDocetaxel in High-risk Node-negative Breast Cancer Patients, In low-risk node-negative breast cancer patients adjuvant chemotherapy should be spared. The identification of this subgroup can be based either on clinical and pathological or on tumour-biological criteria. Due to their high prognostic impact the tumour-biological invasion markers uPA/PAI-1 (urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its inhibitor PAI-1) are potential candidates to effectively assess the risk of relapse in node-negative breast cancer. This study is aimed to compare the risk assessment by the traditional clinico-pathological factors and by tumour-biological factors. The second study question refers to the comparison between an adjuvant combination treatment with FE100C*6 and a sequential treatment with FE100C*3 and Docetaxel*3.    ,NCT01222052

Breast Cancer,Participation Restrictions in Breast Cancer Survivors," This project will develop and preliminarily evaluate an intervention to assist young-middle adult rural breast cancer survivors to overcome functional impairments related to their cancer treatment. Younger breast cancer survivors (below age 60) have ongoing family social and vocational responsibilities and recreational interests and are at increased risk of developing long-term difficulties performing these valued activities (participation restrictions). Rural cancer survivors are medically underserved and due to distance and geographic isolation face significant barriers to accessing traditional rehabilitation services. Alternative rehabilitation approaches are sorely needed for this population. Based on previous research with cancer and other medical populations a working draft of a treatment manual using a telephone-delivered Behavioral Activation and Problem Solving (BA/PS) intervention has been designed. Prior to testing the intervention in a randomized clinical trial additional work must be completed. The specific aims of this study are to a. refine the BA/PS treatment manual b. develop and apply treatment integrity measures for the BA/PS manual c. assess participation restrictions and associated outcomes d. preliminarily assess the immediate and maintenance effects of BA/PS and e. examine mediators and moderators of BA/PS effects based on our ""Self Regulation"" model of functional recovery. 188 young-middle adult breast cancer survivors will be screened for participation restrictions following cancer treatment and 40 survivors with participation restrictions will receive BA/PS delivered by phone. BA/PS participants will be assessed for treatment effectiveness and interviewed regarding their experiences during treatment to provide information for refining the manual. The long-term objective of this line of research is to develop effective and feasible treatments for the medical and psychosocial consequences of cancer and its treatment in medically underserved cancer survivors (e.g. rural populations).

Breast Cancer,Neoadjuvant Doxorubicin Polyglutamate Paclitaxel Capecitabine and Metronomic Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer, The investigators propose to conduct a clinical trial of neoadjuvant treatment utilizing chemotherapy formulations with favorable toxicity profiles: weekly doxorubicin PPX and capecitabine. It is expected this combination will at least maintain the efficacy of a traditional chemotherapy regimen but will be associated with less toxicity particularly nausea vomiting and alopecia. In order to accomplish this the investigators have designed a chemotherapy regimen whose components (or administration schedule) are associated with minimal or no alopecia and are also considered to have low emetogenic potential. In an attempt to improve the efficacy of the regimen the investigators plan to study an alternate schedule of cyclophosphamide and methotrexate administration (metronomic chemotherapy) which appears to inhibit angiogenesis and therefore enhance the activity of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy administered concurrently. In this trial the investigators aim to determine the clinical and pathologic response rate of 12 weeks of doxorubicin followed by 4 cycles of PPX and capecitabine. Metronomic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate will be administered during the 24 weeks of chemotherapy.    ,NCT01227408
Breast Cancer,Comparative Genomic and Genetic Analysis of Paired Primary Breast - Metastatic Tumor Specimens Using High-throughput Platforms, Adequate quality and quantity of RNA may be extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor blocks for gene expression analysis.

Breast Cancer,Cyclophosphamide and Docetaxel Every 3 Weeks as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer, The standard therapy for patients who have locally advanced breast cancer is to receive chemotherapy before surgical removal of tumor. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Chemotherapy is used to shrink the tumor before surgery which sometimes may allow for a smaller portion of the breast to be removed. Receiving chemotherapy before surgery may sometimes also allow for smaller portions of the breast to be removed. Getting chemotherapy prior to surgery may also control any hidden metastatic disease and thereby decrease the risk of cancer relapse. Pre-surgery chemotherapy is a standard management approach for locally advanced breast cancer. Different combinations of drugs can be used as part of the pre-surgery chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to determine if using a chemotherapy regimen of TC is effective way to manage locally advanced breast cancer (Stage IIA- IIIB) when the TC is given before surgery. The investigators also hope this study will help us to better understand how the tumor tissue is affected by this combination of chemotherapy drugs. The TC drug combination is FDA approved for use in treating breast cancer and it has been shown to be equally effective as other commonly used chemotherapy regimens when used after surgery; but the TC drug combination has not yet been studied in conjunction with NAC for use before surgery. The investigators will be studying the combination of TC used before surgery as a means of possibly shrinking the tumor.    ,NCT01229605
Breast Cancer,The Physical and Psychological Benefits of Yoga and Breast Cancer, Breast Cancer is the most common cancer amongst Canadian women. Studies report that breast cancer patients are the most likely to use complementary medicine within the oncologic population. Yoga has become especially popular with this group as it promises to improve the mind body and soul holistically. The investigators yoga program specifically focuses on rebuilding physical strength increasing flexibility and reducing the pain and stress associated with the post-operative period. This study will examine how yoga can help improve the overall quality of life and its effects on the physical well-being of women with breast cancer. With positive statistical results the investigators hope to implement yoga as part of their rehabilitation services at the Cedars Breast Clinic.    ,NCT01230671

Breast Cancer,MIRNA Profiling of Breast Cancer in Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant or Adjuvant Treatment for Locally Advanced & Inflammatory Breast Cancer, MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) regulate the translation of RNAs and are implicated in cell proliferation and renewal both under physiologically normal as well as in malignant conditions. Dysregulation of specific miRNAs may be associated with either gaining oncogenic or loosing tumor suppressing functions. MiRNA dysregulation has been implicated in breast cancer tumorigenic (stem cell) and non-tumorigenic development. Therefore miRNA profiling of treatment naïve and treatment-exposed breast tumors and sequential samples of blood/serum will allow for identification of miRNA markers of prognosis and as indicators and potential targets for personalized therapies. In this proposal specimens from patients treated in the clinical breast cancer program on already existing protocols (IRB 05091 and 05015) will be characterized by Dr. Rossi's laboratory and collaborators and the information gained will be applied to develop specific therapies.    ,NCT01231386

Breast Cancer,MIBG Scintigraphy and Strain Echocardiography in the Detection of Subclinical Cardiovascular Effects One Year After (Neo)Adjuvant Breast Cancer Treatment With Docetaxel Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (TAC): a Pilot Study, Many patients with breastcancer in the past were treated with TAC. These last years there is more and more focus on the effects of chemotherapy particularly in children treated with this. One of these effects is damage to the heart muscle which ultimately might affect the pump-function of the heart . In adults the effect of treatment with TAC on the heart has not been previously investigated. The possibility exists that the adverse reactions in children are found in adults also could occur. Therefore we have initiated this trial.    ,NCT01246856
Breast Cancer,Standard or Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Versus Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI)for Breast Cancer, The standard treatment for localized breast cancer is based on conservative surgery (when possible) followed by radiation therapy (RT) delivered to the whole breast. The recommended total RT dose is 45 to 50 Gy delivered in 4.5 to 5 weeks followed by a 10 to 16 Gy boost to the tumor bed for 1 to 1.5 weeks. The rationale for the development of APBI was based on the difficulty for many patients to reach RT centers to receive standard whole breast irradiation (WBI) after conservative surgery. APBI offers decreased overall treatment time and several theoretical advantages over WBI including a decrease in dose delivered to uninvolved portions of the breast and adjacent organs. If equivalence between the two treatments can be shown then APBI will be considered as a historic evolution in breast cancer management. In this phase III trial designed in postmenopausal women > 50 years of age the objective is to compare the effectiveness and safety of APBI compared with whole breast irradiation. This study is also designed to ensure high quality criteria for surgery pathology and RT techniques in the 3 arms and will allow to provide data on economics and costs.    ,NCT01247233

Breast Cancer,Histologic Assessment of the Difference Between 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy_D-glucose Positron Emission Mammography(PEM) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Breast, Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) is a newly developed imaging examination of the breast that uses a radioactive glucose based tracer which is a form of sugar attached to a low radiation agent to detect cancer cells. The radioactive glucose based tracer is called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and it is FDA approved. A PEM scanner is able to better detect cancer cells within the breast more than a regular PET scanner. The PEM scanner is also FDA approved. This type of imaging may be able to see the breast cancer before it could be seen with mammograms and may be as good as or better than breast MRI. The purpose of this study is to compare the value of FDG Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) with contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the breast for patients with breast cancer. This study will also perform special pathology test to compare the FDG PEM and contrast enhanced breast MRI images with the results from the standard of care breast surgery. This may teach us more about the biology of each breast tumor.    ,NCT01249157

Breast Cancer,Monitoring and Predicting Breast Cancer Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response Using Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging, The investigators have developed imaging protocols to monitor and predict breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy both prior to and as early as possible during the course of treatment. The efficacy and practicality of conventional imaging approaches in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting varies and identifies the need for alternate functional imaging strategies. Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging is an experimental imaging method that allows patients to be followed from baseline through treatment and surgery with a cost-effective bedside handheld scanning probe. The researcher evaluates a harmonized diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging technology platform that has been standardized for neoadjuvant chemotherapy monitoring. Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging is an academic research platform that is non-invasive.

Breast Cancer,Reasons for Changing HOrmonal Therapy of Advanced Breast Cancer, Breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women. Although big advance in diagnostics and treatment of early and breast cancer has been made in recent years breast cancer still has a significant mortality rate. A number of treatment modalities exist for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. The treatment modality is chosen based on patient and tumour characteristics. Hormonal treatment is preferred and recommended in women with hormone sensitive breast cancer (ESMO CECOG and NCCN guidelines). Tumor markers are an established method of monitoring systemic therapies in various cancers. Tumor markers CA 15-3 and CEA are used in clinical practice to monitor treatment efficacy of metastatic breast cancer. Blood levels of tumor markers are widely used to assess response/progression to treatment and guide therapy change. Treatment efficacy is assessed by imaging methods in clinical studies. Change of therapy in clinical study is usually done when progression based on RECIST criteria is found. Hormonal treatment has slower onset of effect compared with chemotherapy that can last several weeks. Also when a new therapy is started spurious early rises may occur. Therefore rising levels of tumor markers during the first weeks of new hormonal therapy are not necessarily sign of progression and should not be the only guidance for treatment change. Evidence of treatment efficacy form clinical studies and treatment change is based on imaging techniques.    ,NCT01265654
Breast Cancer,Effect of Metformin on Breast Cancer Metabolism, Metformin a drug that has been used since the 1950's in the treatment of diabetes has recently generated great interest in its anticancer effects based on in vitro in vivo and clinical studies. This study assesses the pharmacodynamic effects of metformin on breast cancer metabolism. The trial design is based on a 2 centre study 'Early Antiangiogenic Response to Bevacizumab in Primary Breast Cancer' that is about to successfully complete recruitment in Oxford and Mount Vernon hospitals. The study takes advantage of the 2 week window between the first clinic visit and commencement of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Metformin will be given to patients for at least 2 weeks prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a set of 3 breast core biopsies a PET-CT scan and blood tests carried out before and after this 2 week period of treatment. Patients will also receive a drink of heavy (deuterated) water a safe and stable isotope commonly used in clinical lipid metabolism studies the evening prior to both sets of core biopsies. Having completed the first 2 weeks of metformin patients will have the option of continuing metformin until completion of chemotherapy at the discretion of the trial physician. The core biopsies will then be used to assess for changes in:   -  immunohistochemical staining;   -  gene profiles;   -  uptake of heavy water into tumour fatty acids using mass spectrometry techniques. The aim is to identify potential biomarkers of response to metformin (and other future cancer metabolism drugs).    ,NCT01266486

The hypothesis for this pilot study is that AIs negatively impact oral health and oral health quality of life in the setting of breast cancer survivors. Further we hypothesize that dental visits are underutilized in women with BCa undergoing adjuvant AI therapy.    ,NCT01272570
Breast Cancer,Usefulness of Ki67 Index in Hormone Receptor-positive Breast Cancer, Gene expression studies have identified at least four molecularly distinct subtypes of breast cancer including two biologically distinct ER-positive subtypes of breast cancer: luminal A and luminal B (with luminal B tumors having poorer outcomes than luminal A tumors). Although some luminal B tumors can be identified by their expression of HER2 the major biological distinction between luminal A and B is the proliferation signatures including genes such as CCNB1 MKI67 and MYBL2 which have higher expression in luminal B tumors than in luminal A tumors. The high cost of gene expression profiling has limited its incorporation into general clinical practice. To date there is no available IHC-based surrogate assay that can distinguish between luminal A and luminal B tumors. We hypothesized that the IHC determination of the Ki67 index as well as ER PgR and HER2 status is able to distinguish the luminal B subtype of breast cancers from the luminal A subgroup.    ,NCT01273415

Breast Cancer,Paclitaxel Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in the Treatment of Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to see if a combination of drugs can help to treat this type of cancer. One drug is a chemotherapy agent called paclitaxel (Taxol®). Paclitaxel will be given every week through the vein. Although the weekly schedule of paclitaxel is not included in the label the schedule and dose of weekly paclitaxel have been studied and have been proven to be more effective than an old standard schedule. The other two work against HER2. One is called trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and it is commonly given to women with early HER2 positive breast cancer or with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Trastuzumab will be given through the vein every 3 weeks (or every week at the doctor's discretion). The third drug pertuzumab is an investigational drug. It has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It has been given in studies to over 800 people. It has been effective in treating HER2 positive breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,Dietary Fish and Omega 3 Fatty Acids for Breast Cancer Prevention, Research studies show that the type of fat in the diet may affect breast cancer risk. Fish oil and fish contain increased amounts of omega 3 fatty acids which appear to stop or slow down the growth and development of breast cancer cells in laboratory studies of mice and breast cancer cells. The use of omega 3 fatty acids to reduce the risk of breast cancer development in humans has not been adequately studied. Eating fish or taking fish oil may increase the amount of omega 3 in the breast which may lower one's risk of breast cancer development. Persons in this study with do one of the following: (1) take two capsules daily of omega 3 fatty acid supplements or (2) eat several servings of canned salmon / tuna per week for a total of three months. Amounts of omega 3 fatty acids in the body's tissues will be measured by blood tests and a small sample of breast fat as obtained by a fine needle aspiration.

Breast Cancer,Academia Sinica Investigator Award 2010," Over the past five years a spectrum of studies has shown that the stromal cell populations surrounding or embedding cancer cells in a variety of different tumor types are intrinsically involved in the mechanisms affecting tumor growth and metastasis. Among these cells fibroblasts and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been shown to play key roles in the regulation of tumor cell behaviors via differential gene expression regulation and secretion of specific chemokines (e.g. RANTES CXCL12 and CXCL14) cytokines (e.g. TNF-α IL-1β NF-κB) and control by inflammatory and immunomodulatory cells molecules or potent growth factors. Of particular interest is that the various stromal immune cells (dendritic cells and T cells) and inflammatory MDSCs found in primary and metastatic tumors behave very differently from those present in normal or non-cancerous counterpart tissues. In light of these ""new understandings"" in cancer biology the investigators believe that systematic and innovative approaches to further research are very much needed in Taiwan and at our Academy. Here the investigators propose to investigate the tumor suppressive effect of anti-inflammatory phytomedicines on regulation of stromal immune cells and fibroblasts in breast cancers. The investigators will employ the TS/A and 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma system to conduct an in vivo study of several specific candidate phytomedicines (cytopiloyne Wedelia chinensis shikonin emodin and others that the investigators have already identified as conferring anti-inflammation related activities) for inhibition of TS/A and 4T1 tumor growth and specific effects on inflammation-associated cellular and molecular functions of stromal immune cells fibroblasts and MDSCs. When potent and specific anti-tumor effects are detected the investigators will extend our study to a three-dimensional collagen/Matrigel culture system for ex-vivo study focusing on the stromal cell-mediated or -associated anti-tumor effects of TS/A or 4T1 cells using the ""organoid"" tissue culture systems the investigators have previously developed in our laboratory (JNCI 1979; Cancer Res. 1981). The investigators will establish reconstituted TS/A or 4T1 tumor cells with the stromal immune cells in a co-cultivation system. When the investigators have achieved demonstrable success the investigators will extend the mouse system to human breast cancers (including primary and metastatic tumors) by a close collaboration (which the investigators have already established) with Drs.

Breast Cancer,Autophagy Inhibition Using Hydrochloroquine in Breast Cancer Patients, Hydroxychloroquine is a drug that has been used to treat malaria and rheumatism. It is recently discovered that Hydroxychloroquine increases 'autophagy'. Autophagy is a process whereby cells eat a part themselves giving them extra energy. Cancer cells use autophagy to survive chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Also cancer cells use autophagy to survive in areas of a tumor where there is a low oxygen level. The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with the drug Hydroxychloroquine leads to a decrease of autophagy in breast cancer tissue.    ,NCT01292408

Breast Cancer,Can Exercise Improve Cancer Associated Cognitive Dysfunction?, Following chemotherapy some breast cancer survivors report alterations in their ability to remember concentrate or think which can have significant emotional psychological and economic impact on their lives. Survivors have also reported feeling frustrated by the response of the medical community who either may not acknowledge their symptoms or have no treatment options to suggest. Exercise may be a promising treatment as improvements in cognitive function with exercise have been demonstrated in older adults and other clinical populations. The investigators will recruit women who have completed chemotherapy for breast cancer (within the past 2 years) and report cognitive changes. Women will be randomly assigned to either a 24-week aerobic exercise intervention or delayed exercise control (offered the same exercise program following the study). At the start and end of the study the investigators will measure: i) performance on four standard neuropsychological tests that measure working memory learning and problem solving; ii) a questionnaire on cognitive function and its impact on quality of life; iii) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during two of the standard neuropsychological tests which provides information on how the brain is working during the tests. To knowledge of the investigators this is the first study to examine the effect of an exercise intervention on cognitive function in breast cancer survivors. In addition the use of fMRI imaging is a new way to approach this research question and may be more sensitive to change than traditional measures of cognitive function.    ,NCT01296893
Breast Cancer,Prospective Analysis of Changes in Background Parenchymal Enhancement (BPE) and Amount of Fibroglandular Tissue on Breast MRI, Tamoxifen is a hormonal treatment for breast cancer. It prevents recurrent disease and decreases death. Tamoxifen is given to women with and at high risk for breast cancer. These women also commonly have breast MRI to monitor for breast cancer. Some features of normal breast tissue visible on breast MRI change depending on patient hormonal status. It has been questioned if hormonal changes due to tamoxifen are seen on breast MRI. Pilot data suggests this is true. If tamoxifen causes changes in normal breast tissue on MRI more study could be done looking at whether breast MRI could tell us anything about whether tamoxifen is working. This study is being done to see if tamoxifen changes normal breast tissue on MRI. It will also look at if other factors like taking anti-depressants or gene type have any effect.    ,NCT01297231

Breast Cancer,Rosuvastatin to Lower Circulating Tissue Factor Bearing Microparticles in Metastatic Breast Cancer, Research studies have shown a strong association between cancer and blood clots in the veins (also known as deep vein thrombosis). These blood clots can flow to the lungs (pulmonary embolism) which in severe cases may be life threatening. Studies have demonstrated that increases in microparticles may contribute to the development of deep vein thrombosis in cancer patients. The purpose of this research study is to see if rosuvastatin lowers the number of tissue factor bearing microparticles in the blood (TFMP). TFMP are small particles that are generated from different types of blood cells in the body. In people who have cancer TFMP are thought to be generated from cancer cells and may represent a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis.    ,NCT01299038

Breast Cancer,Getting Back on Track: An Educational Group for Women With Breast Cancer," As the number of women who survive breast cancer continues to grow more attention is being paid to their quality of life and the disease's long-term effects. The transition from patient to survivor also termed the ""re-entry transition"" can be a very difficult and stressful time. A brief psychosocial intervention delivered at this important transition time may address the challenges that women face at re-entry facilitating greater adaptation and more optimal recovery. The purpose of the proposed RCT is to test the acceptability and effectiveness of a single-session group psychoeducational intervention led by a multi-disciplinary team on adjustment to survivorship. A randomized controlled trial design (RCT) will be used to recruit 440 women attending the breast clinic at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto. Participants will be recruited while completing their adjuvant radiotherapy and those who agree to participate will complete the baseline questionnaire package (T0). They then will be randomized to receive either: (1) standard print material (CRL group n=220); or (2) standard print material and a single session group psychoeducational intervention (INT group n=220). Two weeks following randomization participants in the CRL group will be given the ""Getting Back on Track: Life after Treatment"" booklet (current standard care) which includes information on the new health care team physical side-effects diet and exercise emotional and social needs and returning to everyday life. Participants in the INT group will receive the same booklet and will also attend a 2- hour psychoeducational group session facilitated by a multidisciplinary team. Participants in both groups will be asked to complete the questionnaire package again at 3 months (post-1) and 6 -months (post-2) following the completion of cancer treatment. Participants in the INV group will also be asked to rate their satisfaction with the class and provide feedback on the content. The proposed intervention will be one of the few clinical interventions designed to address the service gap in helping women to make the transition from patients to survivors by using a single-session psychoeducational group intervention.

Breast Cancer,Dasatinib In Combination With Trastuzumab And Paclitaxel In The First Line Treatment Of Her2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Patients, This is a single-arm open-label phase I/II study. In the phase I patients with HER2-positive MBC will be treated with paclitaxel trastuzumab and increasing doses of dasatinib to determine the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) and RPD (Recommended Phase II Dose) of the combination. Once the RPD has been identified 48 additional patients will be treated at that dose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination in the phase II. Primary Objective:   -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RPD) of dasatinib in combination with fixed doses of trastuzumab and paclitaxel in HER2-positive MBC patients (Phase I).   -  To determine the efficacy measured by objective response rate (ORR) in HER2-positive MBC patients with measurable disease (Phase II). Primary Endpoint:   -  To determine the incidence rate of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within the first cycle of dasatinib in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel at each dose level in HER2-positive MBC patients (Phase I).   -  To assess the ORR (defined in the RECIST 1.1 as complete response rate + partial response rate) measured by the appropriate radiological test in HER2-positive MBC patients with measurable disease (Phase II). Sample Size: Phase I: following the 3+3 rule a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 patients will be recruited. Phase II:Assuming 10% drop-out rate 48 patients are required to enter the study. The duration of the study from first patient visit to last patient visit will be approximately 42 months.    ,NCT01306942
Breast Cancer,Abraxane With or Without Tigatuzumab in Patients With Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer, Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American women. Metastatic disease including metastatic breast cancer unfortunately remains incurable. One reason is due to the inability to develop specific therapies for specific cancer subsets. The use of modern genomic techniques has significantly enhanced our recent understanding of breast cancer biology. Five distinct breast cancer subsets have been recognized one of which is basal-like breast cancer. Basal-like breast cancer is typically estrogen receptor (ER) negative progesterone receptor (PR) negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2-Neu) negative. This is referred to as triple negative breast cancer or TBNC. TBNC represents a significant proportion of breast cancer patients (10-20%) and has a poor prognosis with no targeted approach to therapy as of yet. Tigatuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting a death receptor on the breast cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that combining antibodies with selected chemotherapy agents have induced tumor cell death. The hypothesis of this study is to use tigatuzumab and combine it with Abraxane to serve as a targeting agent in metastatic TBNC patients.    ,NCT01307891

Breast Cancer,Use of Continuous Wound Infusion of Bupivacaine for Analgesia Following Axillary Clearance Surgery, Axillary clearance forms part of the surgical armamentarium for the treatment of breast cancer. Although the introduction of sentinel lymph node mapping and dissection has allowed for the decreased use of axillary clearance it remains a frequently performed operation. Axillary clearance is associated with moderate postoperative pain. We hypothesize that a continuous wound infusion of 0.2% Bupivacaine at 4ml/hr would provide superior analgesia when compared to standard opioid-based analgesia in patients undergoing axillary lymph node clearance surgery.    ,NCT01314144
Breast Cancer,Efficacy Study of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Chinese Primary Breast Cancer Patients, In recent years the increasing number of breast cancer patients shows the fact breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women in China. However the mortality rate has seen a dramatic decline mainly due to early detection of breast cancer and the use of effective multimodel treatment. Recent studies suggest breast cancers are heterogeneous and recognized by biological subtypes which lead to markedly different clinical outcome. Adjuvant chemotherapy is widely used in the treatment for primary breast cancer patients. Different types of breast cancer cells are sensitive to different types of drugs.There is no data to support the information about the adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for different subtypes breast cancer patients?especially for Chinese women. The investigators hypothesized to confirm the possibility of finding the adjuvant chemotherapy aimed to different subtypes of breast cancer.    ,NCT01314833

Breast Cancer,Diet Composition Weight Control and Breast Carcinogenesis, In the United States overweight (BMI > 25 but < 30 Kg/m2) and obesity (BMI > 30Kg/m2) are increasing at epidemic rates. A significant association exists between being overweight or obese and breast cancer recurrence and survival. However evidence continues to accumulate indicating that achieving or maintaining a healthy weight for height (Body Mass Index BMI 18.5-25Kg/m2) is associated with a reduced risk for breast cancer and with a decrease in breast cancer associated mortality. Despite this there is a lack of randomized controlled trials exploring this association and how the process of fat loss or being successful in actually reaching a healthy weight for height differentially affects biomarkers for cancer recurrence. Many dietary approaches for weight loss are currently available to the public and each purports to offer advantages. However there is little scientific evidence to indicate how these dietary approaches some of which vary markedly in the foods that they limit or exclude affect biomarkers for breast cancer risk. In particular it is not know whether the critical factor in relation to weight and breast cancer is simply weight loss (negative energy balance) irrespective of the manner in which it is achieved or if certain dietary approaches affect breast cancer risk biomarkers more favorably than others. Published data from our laboratory suggest that dietary pattern does matter and therefore the goal of this study is to investigate the effects of two popular weight loss dietary approaches that differ in the extent to which they limit carbohydrate or fat consumption (with effects on dietary glycemic load) compared to a usual care group on prognostic markers for cancer recurrence in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. The investigators hypothesize that in addition to the anticipated effects of fat loss on circulating levels of bioavailable sex steroid hormones that the effects of excess fat on breast cancer prognosis can be attributed to three interrelated metabolic processes that affect cancer progression: altered glucose metabolism chronic inflammation and excessive cellular oxidation.    ,NCT01315483
Breast Cancer,Determination of Predictive Genetic Markers of Toxicity After Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients Post-Conservative Surgery," The single shot partial breast irradiation (SSPBI) trial was designed as a prospective Phase II ""single-arm study"". The use of a single dose tumor bed is expected to be very effective in terms of tumor control but it could increase the incidence of radiation induced erythema. Therefore the investigators assumed that a decreased DNA repair capability as well as a reduced detoxification of the damage caused by oxidative stress could explain the increased acute toxicity i.e. a higher incidence of erythema after a single dose. For this reason the investigators decided to investigate SNPs of genes involved in antioxidant and DNA damage repair pathways such as GST XRCC1 XRCC3 and RAD51. The investigators assumed an erythema rate of 20% and 54% in patient groups at low and high risk respectively (groups were identified based on the absence/presence of the above polymorphisms alone or in combination) thus the minimum sample size was 56 patients with α=0.05 2-tailed test and a power of the study of 80%.

Breast Cancer,Prognostic and Predictive Impact of uPA/PAI-1, Chemo-N0 (1993-1998) is the first prospective randomized multicenter trial in N0 BC designed to prospectively evaluate the clinical utility of a biomarker. It used uPA/PAI 1 as stratification criteria and randomized high-risk patients to chemotherapy versus observation; low-risk patients remained without any systemic therapy. The trial was designed to answer two principle questions:   1. Can the reported prognostic impact of uPA and PAI 1 be validated in a prospective multicenter therapy trial? Does low uPA/PAI 1 identify those low-risk N0 patients who are candidates for being spared necessity and burden of adjuvant chemotherapy?   2. Do uPA/PAI 1 high-risk patients benefit from adjuvant CMF chemotherapy?    ,NCT01317108

Breast Cancer,Patient Empowerment by Group Medical Consultations, Carriers of a BRCA mutation have a significantly increased risk to develop breast cancer in the course of their lives . They face a difficult choice: either a preventive removal of the breast(s) or an intensive inspection process. After primary treatment of breast cancer patients will be followed for 5-10 years to diagnose recurrence or a new primary tumor in an early stage; to support the patient during hormonal treatment; to educate the patient about risk factors and healthy life style; and to provide psychosocial support. Currently follow-up of breast cancer patients and surveillance of BRCA mutation carriers is offered in regular one-to-one medical visits. Experience shows that in an individual visit it is often not possible to give all aspects that are important enough attention. The group medical consultation (GMC) is a new form of medical visits where the physician or nurse practitioner performs a series of one-to-one consultations in the presence of 8 to10 other patients. A social worker accompanies this process. Patients in group consultations may gather more information because they learn from each other and there is relatively more time compared to a regular consultation. Research shows that both patients and caregivers are more satisfied with care after a group consultation compared to individual visits. After a GMC the participants from the breast cancer GMCs will be provided with a dedicated iPad for 3 months. Using this iPad patients can contact the women they have met during the GMC as well as health care professionals by several communication channels including virtual group meetings. This approach provides a unique combination of both social support and professional education concerning survivorship in an e-health environment.However it is also known that group sessions may be counterproductive for some patients for example because they are frightened by the stories of others. The goal of this study is to examine whether group visits (in combination with dedicated iPads) are beneficial to women with a BRCA mutation and for patients in follow-up after breast cancer.    ,NCT01329068

Breast Cancer,Impact of Nutritional Intervention in Women With Breast Cancer Under Adjuvant Chemotherapy, Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Weight gain in adulthood overweight or obesity physical inactivity and alcohol consumption are risk factors commonly associated with risk of breast cancer (mainly for post-menopausal for overweight and obesity). Reduced physical activity is one factor likely to weight gain in women after adjuvant chemotherapy for localized breast cancer. Furthermore physical activity appropriately could improve many prognostic factors and survival of women after breast cancer. Adapted Physical Activity (APA) could improve fitness quality of life body image treatment compliance and reduce fatigue. After diagnosis of breast cancer there is many possible risk factors of mortality or morbidity related to nutritional factors available to management. These risks prevention through management of these patients appears indispensable through an APA program. Thus the investigators propose to test the feasibility of implementing a program of dietary intervention and APA to prevent the risk of weight gain (which affects more than half of patients) and maintain and/or increase their level of physical activity during and after adjuvant chemotherapy.    ,NCT01331772

Breast Cancer,Effectiveness of a Decision Support System in Improving the Diagnosis and Screening Rate of Breast Cancer, Clinical decision support has been shown to improve the performance of screening tests; however few studies have documented direct clinical benefit resulting from the increased screening promoted by clinical decision support systems. The purpose of this study was to determine if a standards-based sophisticated decision support system could not only promote additional breast cancer screening but also detect significantly more breast cancer    ,NCT01336257
Breast Cancer,Improving the Immune System With Human IL-7 Vaccine in Older Subjects Who Have Had Chemotherapy, Background: Drugs given to treat cancer (chemotherapy) can weaken the human immune system. But it can also become weaker because of aging. Interleukin (IL)-7 a molecule produced naturally in the body can help improve the function of the immune system. Researchers want to study the effects of IL-7 on immune system function in two different groups of older people. One group will be people who have received vaccines before IL-7. The other group will be people who have received Vaccines after IL-7. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of IL-7 on the immune system responses to vaccines in older people following chemotherapy. Eligibility: People at least 60 years of age who have recently finished chemotherapy for breast colon or bladder cancer. Design:   -  People in the study will be screened with a physical examination medical history and blood tests. Other screening tests such as tumor imaging may also need to be performed.   -  Everyone will receive a series of five different vaccines commonly used to prevent diseases. We will compare the responses of people in Sequence 1 who will receive vaccines before IL-7 with the responses of people in Sequence 2 who received the same vaccines after IL-7.   -  The vaccines will be given randomly in two Arms at different times.   -  Arm 1: diphtheria and tetanus polio pneumonia (with two booster shots) hepatitis B (with two booster shots) and hepatitis A (with one booster shot)   -  Arm 2: hepatitis A (with one booster shot) hepatitis B (with two booster shots) pneumococcal (with two booster shots) diphtheria and tetanus polio pneumonia (with two booster shots)   -  There are 5 vaccines to be given to each subject following one of two randomly assigned sequences of vaccine administration (Sequence 1 or Sequence 2).   -  The first vaccine arm contains the two diphtheria protein containing vaccines tetanus and diphtheria (Td) and pneumococcal conjugate 13 (PCV13) and polio. The second vaccine arm contains the Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B vaccines. Subjects will either get tetanus diphtheria polio and pneumonia vaccines before IL-7 therapy (Sequence 1) or hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines before IL-7 therapy (Sequence 2). The response to vaccines will be evaluated 4 weeks after vaccination. This will be followed by IL-7 therapy then administration of the other group of vaccines. Therefore subjects on both arms will receive the same set of vaccines just at different times with respect to IL-7 therapy.    ,NCT01339000
Breast Cancer,Teleconference Group: Breast Cancer in African Americans (STORY), African American women with breast cancer have decreased quality of life (and mood when compared to European American. Research has not examined the effectiveness of therapeutic group for African American women with breast cancer even though positive effects are well established for Caucasians. The aims of the randomized clinical trial are to determine the effectiveness of TG by teleconference for African American women with breast cancer and what factors may impact on the intervention. The primary hypothesis is that participants in the intervention group will have significantly greater cancer knowledge less fear less isolation better social connection better mood and better QOL when compared to a control group receiving usual psychosocial care. Two hundred forty African American women with breast cancer will be recruited. Intervention participants attend eight weekly 90 minute sessions by teleconference and two follow-up boosters. Each culturally appropriate session contains the story information and group processes of connection commonality and catharsis. Information focuses on increasing self care and stress management knowledge while countering myths and taboos. Story capitalizes on African American oral traditions by discussing coping parables. Group processes provide an alternative source of social support and opportunities to express feelings. Control group subjects receive standard psychosocial care (the use of any support programs or services locally or nationally. Testing will occur at baseline after 10 group sessions and 16 weeks post baseline. The study findings are expected to inform about the effectiveness of therapeutic groups in African American women with breast cancer and lay the groundwork for exploring if reducing disparities in psychosocial care have a health benefit.    ,NCT01339351

Breast Cancer,An Online Psychoeducational Intervention for Young Women With Breast Cancer and Their Partners, Breast cancer is distressing for couples in general but even more so when the illness strikes at a relatively young age. In addition to common relationship challenges younger couples have to contend with the loss or disruption of age-appropriate goals for themselves. Presently there are virtually no resources designed specifically to assist young couples coping with breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate an online educational program geared to the unique needs and demanding schedules of young couples. The purpose of the program is to improve couples' relationships and mutual coping. Seventeen couples will take part in the 7-week program. They will complete questionnaires before and after participating to evaluate the program's helpfulness. This study will allow for the creation of a user-friendly cost-effective tool that could help to improve the lives of all young couples coping with breast cancer in the years to come.    ,NCT01342302
Breast Cancer,Prospective Radiologic Evaluation of Changes Following Fat Grafting, Breast implants are currently used for cosmetic breast augmentation and in breast reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer. Fat grafting is a technique where fat is injected around the periphery of a breast implant to camouflage the transition between implant and the body. The investigators propose to show mammography images of women who have had breast implants with fat grafting to informed and blinded radiologists and evaluate their readings of the images. Hypothesis: with mammographic screening radiologists will be able to distinguish between findings associated with fat grafting and those which are suspicious for breast cancer.    ,NCT01343030

Breast Cancer,Risk Education and Assessment for Cancer Heredity, Individuals living in geographically underserved areas encounter considerable barriers to access of quality cancer genetic services. Although in-person genetic counseling has generally been accepted as the standard of care the use of telecommunications to deliver clinical genetic services may help reduce this disparity in access to such services. However before the widespread adoption of telephone-delivered cancer genetic services occurs it is critical to analyze the efficacy and safety of this mode of communication. This two-group randomized equivalency/non-inferiority trial will determine whether telephone-based cancer genetic counseling is an acceptable alternative to the traditional in-person mode among women who have a personal or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer strong enough to warrant genetic counseling and testing. This study's findings will provide important information to cancer centers and cancer control policies about the safety efficacy and costs of delivering telephone-based clinical cancer genetic services for geographically challenged women at risk for having Breast Cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) 1/2 mutations.    ,NCT01346761
Breast Cancer,Investigational Drug in Combination With Two Chemotherapy Drugs in Women With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer, In 2008 there were more than 40000 deaths caused by metastatic breast cancer in the United States. The development of new treatment strategies is essential to improve outcome for patients with metastatic breast cancer There is significant preclinical and clinical evidence indicating that creating new blood vessels (neoangiogenesis) to provide nutrients to solid tumors including breast cancer provides the necessary conditions to allow tumor growth. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the important molecules regulating new blood vessel formations and subsequent invasion and metastases. As a result agents that inhibit VEGF are of substantial interest for the treatment of advanced diseases. This study will further the body of research of motesanib which has been shown in preclinical pharmacology and clinical pharmacology studies to be a potent orally bioavailable multi-kinase inhibitor with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity achieved by selectively targeting all known VEGF platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and Kit receptors.    ,NCT01349088

Breast Cancer,Population-Based Patient-Centric Care: Comprehensive Preventive Cancer Screening Using Health IT," Although there is considerable evidence that current health IT can improve certain elements of care the most effective and efficient implementation of health IT systems for primary care population management are not currently known. Indeed while many systems currently take a ""case-management"" approach to identify and address clinical care issues for high risk patients no systems to our knowledge apply a risk-based approach that accounts both for adverse clinical outcome risk (e.g. breast cancer in a woman who has not had indicated screening for 4 years) and for clinical process risk (e.g. the likelihood that a specific patient will ignore a reminder letter and would therefore benefit from direct phone or in person contact). The investigators propose to directly test the hypothesis that implementing a health IT platform that 1) provides novel risk-based decision support using data derived from the electronic health record (EHR) and 2) leverages each clinician's unique knowledge of his or her patient panel will result in more effective and more efficient population-based primary care. The investigators will test this hypothesis in a practice-randomized clinical trial of preventive cancer screening within our primary care Practice-Based Research Network (PBRN).    ",NCT01372527
Breast Cancer,Guilford Genomic Medicine Initiative (GGMI)," -  Genomic medicine using genetic information to improve health outcomes is heralded as the answer to rising medical costs by focusing on prevention and tailored care. Despite its potential little investigation has focused on how genomic medicine can be applied in health care. To be effective it requires new ways to learn deliver and communicate medical information. It will also raise new ethical questions.   -  The overall goal of Guilford Genomic Medicine Initiative (GGMI) is to identify the specific challenges in ""re-structuring"" an existing medical system to integrate genomic medicine and create solutions that can be used by other medical systems such as the extensive military medical care system. To accomplish this goal GGMI includes the development of a large-scale genomic medicine education initiative targeted at the community providers and patients and a clinical systems model to implement strategies to facilitate the integration of genomic medicine into several pilot practices.

Breast Cancer,Investigating the Impact of Tamoxifen Therapy on Ovarian Aging, Ovarian toxicity is a well-described side effect of traditional chemotherapy in premenopausal women receiving treatment for early stage breast cancer. However the impact of long-term endocrine therapy on ovarian function is not established and to our knowledge has never been directly studied. Understanding the effects of hormone therapy on ovarian aging will help breast cancer patients of reproductive age make more informed and empowered decisions regarding their treatment. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between tamoxifen therapy and ovarian aging. Patients will be identified through the UCSF Cancer Registry and California Pacific Medical Center Cancer Registry and will be evaluated based on age and menopausal status. Women who read about the study from clinicaltrials.gov and contact the study coordinator will also be considered for enrollment. The age of menopause onset will be assessed through surveys and will be compared to the accepted national average age of natural menopause. Biomarkers of ovarian reserve will be assessed in premenopausal women between ages 25-45 and will be compared to those of healthy age- and ethnicity-matched premenopausal controls from an ongoing RO1- funded prospective longitudinal ovarian aging (OVA) study.    ,NCT01384526
Breast Cancer,Understanding Decision Making Processes for Undergoing Genetic Testing Among Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer," Genes are the ""blueprints"" for our bodies. Some people are born with an abnormal copy (""mutation"") of a gene. These people may have a higher chance of getting a disease. Different mutations in different genes cause different diseases. Some women get breast cancer because they are born with an abnormal copy of a gene called BRCA1 or BRCA2. These women also have a higher chance of getting ovary cancer. Women with breast cancer and an abnormal copy of BRCA1 or BRCA2 also have a higher chance of getting a second breast cancer in their other breast. Because of this women who might have a mutation may have genetic testing soon after their breast cancer diagnosis to learn about their risks of getting another cancer. Genetic testing may be done right after a woman has been diagnosed with breast cancer. It may also be done later after surgery is done to treat the cancer. The investigators do not know when it is best to do genetic testing. The investigators are doing this study to try to understand whether women prefer testing before or after surgery. The investigator also want to find out how they feel about their choice later on when their diagnosis in more in their past.    ",NCT01386411
Breast Cancer,CT-011 and p53 Genetic Vaccine for Advanced Solid Tumors, Background:   -  The p53 gene normally helps to stop cancer cells from growing. However when the p53 gene is mutated or damaged cancer cells may grow unchecked. Researchers have been working on a vaccine that will help the immune system recognize and destroy cells that have the p53 mutation and may be cancerous.   -  CT-011 is another drug that may help the body's immune system to fight cancer. This drug blocks a chemical found on tumor cells that prevents the immune system from recognizing and destroying them. Research studies have shown that CT-011 slows the growth of tumors. By combining the p53 vaccine and CT-011 researchers hope to slow or stop tumor growth in people whose cancer that has not responded to standard treatments. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of CT-011 and the p53 genetic vaccine to treat adults with solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatments. Eligibility: - People at least 18 years of age who have solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatments. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also have blood tests and tumor imaging studies.   -  Participants will receive the p53 vaccine as an injection in the arm or thigh.   -  Two days after receiving the p53 vaccine those in the study will receive CT-011 as an infusion over about 2 hours. Participants will be monitored during the infusion for any side effects.   -  The combination of p53 vaccine and CT-011 will be repeated every 3 weeks (one cycle). Treatment will continue as long as the side effects are not severe and the tumor does not grow.   -  Three weeks after the second dose of p53 vaccine and CT-011 participants will have a full physical exam. They will also have blood tests and tumor imaging studies. This exam set will be repeated after every two cycles of p53 vaccine and CT-011.   -  Participants will have regular follow-up visits for up to a year after stopping treatment.    ,NCT01386502

Breast Cancer,Prediction of Pain After Breast Cancer Surgery With EEG, 1. Rationale The inter-individual pain experience immediately after surgery is considerable. In addition a number of patients develop chronic post surgery pain (CPSP). Patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer are at risk of developing both acute post surgical pain as well as CPSP. Recently in a group of patients with chronic back pain it was demonstrated how subjectively reported pain is associated with specific electroencephalography (EEG) parameters namely the N2 and P3 components of the pain event-related potential (ERP). It was concluded that ERP was associated with self-reported pain in daily life up to two weeks after the measurement. This resulted in the current hypothesis that EEG may be a predictor for postoperative pain.   2. Study design Prospective cohort study. Within 2 weeks before surgery 150 patients will undergo an EEG measurement with five 'vulnerability' tasks. The experiment will be repeated 6 months postoperatively. Study population: Female patients with breast cancer who will undergo breast surgery between the ages of 18 to 65 years.   3. Main study parameters/endpoints Primary outcome is postoperative pain measured in a pain diary 4 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes are development of chronic post surgery pain and quality of life. The main goal is to develop a comprehensive prediction model for acute and chronic postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery based on the EEG results of the five vulnerability experiments.    ,NCT01392248

Breast Cancer,Experience of the Patient Treated With Trastuzumab (Herceptin ®) as Adjuvant for Breast Cancer," Many studies have been devoted to the quality of life of patients during adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer by highlighting fatigue psychological distress and impact on the immediate environment (spouse children) during this difficult time for women. Curiously no study to date has been submitted or published about how women with a one-year treatment ""extra"" Herceptin ® live this period in terms of quality of life in terms of psychological impact for themselves and their families. The investigators have no more data on how often they return to work during this treatment or on the psycho-social parameters which underpin them. It therefore seemed interesting to ""give a spotlight"" on this particular period in these women HER2 + by comparing a patient population of same age receiving the same adjuvant but with no Herceptin ®.

Breast Cancer,Bootcamp During Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer, This is a randomized single-site pilot study incorporating one control group. This research involves an exercise group and a non-exercise group (control group). The patients who are in the exercise group will be enrolled in the Dallas County Women's Adventure Boot Camp. This will require them to undergo exercise training 3 times per week under the direction of an experienced personal trainer in a group setting. All Boot Camp personal trainers are trained in basic cardiac life support (CPR) and are trained to watch for any signs or symptoms associated with a poor exercise response. The investigators hypothesize that randomizing women to a supervised exercise program of core conditioning muscular/circuit training and short distance running administered during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer can be performed. Patients will continue on study as they are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for their breast cancer. This will be about 4 - 6 months.    ,NCT01411787
Breast Cancer,Epigenetics and Psychoneurologic Symptoms in Women With Breast Cancer, This study examines the relationship among epigenetic alterations and the development and persistence of psychoneurologic symptoms (cognitive dysfunction depressive symptoms anxiety fatigue sleep disturbance and pain) in women receiving chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer. The relationship among inflammatory markers and psychoneurologic symptoms will also be explored. It is hypothesized:   1. Chemotherapy triggers inflammatory activation which in turn leads to the acquisition of genetic alterations. These alterations result in cellular changes and are modified over time.   2. Inflammatory activation and epigenetic alterations are related to the temporal development severity and persistence of psychoneurologic symptoms.    ,NCT01411943
Breast Cancer,Safety and Aesthetic Outcomes of Breast Conserving Surgery With Peri-areolar Incision Approach, Cosmetic result after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) would impose great effect upon patient's quality of life. Although peri-areolar incision has been widely used in benign breast tumor excision mastopexy procedures and skin-sparing mastectomy with primary reconstruction the actual safety and aesthetic outcome of the peri-areolar incision approach in BCS for cancer patients has not been established by randomized controlled trials. This trial was design to compare the Safety and aesthetic outcomes of breast conserving surgery between peri-areolar incision approach and traditional methods.    ,NCT01412788

Breast Cancer,Trastuzumab Administered Concurrently or Sequentially to Anthracycline-containing Adjuvant Regimen for Breast Cancer, Most of the published data support the preferential use of an anthracycline-containing adjuvant regimen for individuals with HER2-positive tumors. Concurrent anthracyclines and trastuzumab however are contraindicated due to the observation of unacceptably high rates of cardiotoxicity in a large randomized trial in the metastatic setting. However in neoadjuvant setting trastuzumab concurrently with an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen had shown high pathological complete response (pCR) and very low cardiotoxicity. All large adjuvant trials have evaluated only the sequential strategy of administering anthracyclines and trastuzumab. The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab concurrently with an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen has never been evaluated in adjuvant setting. Given the similar patients characteristics the investigators hypothesize that trastuzumab concurrently with an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen would not increase cardiotoxicity but efficacy.    ,NCT01413828
Breast Cancer,Cocinar Para su Salud! (Cook for Your Life!), Hispanic women are 20% more likely to die of breast cancer than non Hispanic white women who are diagnosed at a similar age and stage. One reason for this disparity may be differences in post diagnosis dietary behaviors. In order to reduce this disparity and to improve overall survivorship culturally appropriate dietary interventions that teach women how to eat a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in saturated fat need to be developed for Hispanic breast cancer survivors. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled study (n=70 35 per arm) to test the effects of the ¡Cocinar para su salud! program on changing dietary behaviors among Hispanic breast cancer survivors who have recently completed treatment. The ¡Cocinar para su salud! program is a 12 week course that provides hands on education and instruction in nutrition education meal preparation and food shopping in a group setting. All participants will be followed for a total of 12 months have clinical assessments at baseline 6 months and 12 months and monthly telephone contacts using motivational interview techniques. The Primary Aims are to determine the effect of the dietary intervention (¡Cocinar para su salud! program) vs. control (standard written nutrition education materials for cancer survivors) on 1) daily servings of fruit/vegetable and 2) daily servings of fat intake from baseline to 6 months. The investigators hypothesize that the dietary intervention will result in a larger increase of fruit and vegetable intake and a larger reduction of fat intake when compared to the control group. Secondary Aims are to determine the effect of the dietary intervention vs. control on 1) biomarkers of fruit and vegetable intake molecular biomarkers associated with breast cancer risk and anthropometric measures at 6 and 12 months; 2) fruit/vegetable and fat intake at 12 months; 3) mediators of dietary change including readiness to change outcome expectations perceived self efficacy food and nutrition skills self regulation skills and barriers to adherence; and 4) changes in quality of life and anxiety/depression at 6 and 12 months.    ,NCT01414062

Breast Cancer,Cancer Mortality Affected by the Choice of Anesthetic Drugs?, Knowledge gap: Does the choice of anaesthetic affect outcome for cancer surgery? Aim: To retrospectively examine possible associations (Cox Multiple Regression) between survival from breast- colorectal- or skin cancer and the choice of hypnotic used during surgery ahead of a prospective randomised controlled trial. Hypotheses: One- and five-year survival will be significantly higher after radical breast- colorectal- or skin cancer surgery in patients given the intravenously administered hypnotic propofol than in patients given the inhalational hypnotic sevoflurane. Method: To merge two registers of which one holds demographic- anaesthetic- and surgical data from 6 303 patients operated on at the three mentioned anatomical locations at the Central Hospital in Vasteras Sweden during a twelve year period (1998-2009). Of these minimum 4 500 operations would be due to cancer. This register is unique in that it contains both types of anaesthesia. The other register holds survival data (date and cause of death) stored at the Regional Oncologic Center in Uppsala. The choice of anaesthetic will be validated by controlling each patient's anaesthetic paper file concomitantly with extraction of details from anaesthesia and surgery such as the functional classification of each patient (according to American Association of Anesthesiologists) co-morbidity duration of anaesthesia and surgery amount of blood loss and possible transfusion. Current knowledge: Different anaesthetics have opposite effects on the immune system and on the DNA. There is a well-established association between the state of the immune system and cancer growth which in turn will influence survival. There is also an association between DNA damage and cancer development. Inhalational anaesthetics e.g. sevoflurane act pro-inflammatory and they are also proven to be genotoxic. Propofol is anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative and it is not genotoxic. Objective: Strengthen the hypotheses and get statistics for a proper power calculation in advance of a multi-centre prospective randomised controlled trial. Impact: General anaesthesia is an indispensable part of radical cancer surgery. Undesired effects from anaesthesia on survival has strong relevance for the over all cancer treatment.    ,NCT01418326

Breast Cancer,CRRS-4 Pivotal Somo?v??ABUS ROC Reader Observer Study, To determine the impact on Interpreting Physician performance in detecting breast cancer as defined by the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) when Automated Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) and screening mammography (XRM) are combined compared to screening mammography alone in asymptomatic women with >50% parenchymal density and a screening mammogram assigned a BI-RADS Assessment Category 1 (negative) or 2 (normal with benign findings). The effect of the improved Reader performance is illustrated by plotting the ROC curves for XRM alone and XRM+ABUS. If Reader performance improves with the addition of ABUS to the XRM the area under the curve (AUC) for XRM+ABUS (AUCXRM+ABUS) will be greater than the area under the curve for XRM Alone (AUCXRM Alone). This difference is represented as ?AUCABUS. The null and alternative hypotheses can be formally expressed as follows: H0: ?AUCABUS = 0 AUCXRM+ABUS = AUCXRM Alone The null hypothesis is that Reader performance will be unchanged with the addition of ABUS to a screening mammogram assigned a BI-RADS Assessment Category of 1 or 2. HA: ?AUCABUS ??0 AUCXRM+ABUS ??AUCXRM Alone The alternative hypothesis is that Reader performance will be changed with the addition of ABUS to a screening mammogram assigned a BI-RADS Assessment Category of 1 or 2. A statistically significant change will be considered equivalent to a statistically significant improvement if the estimated value of AUCXRM+ABUS is greater than that of AUCXRM Alone with statistical significance at an alpha level of .05 for a two-sided test.    ,NCT01424956

Breast Cancer,Triple Negative Breast Cancer: Study of Molecular and Genetic Factors, Breast cancer triples negatives (TN; 15 % of the cases) are characterized by a high histoprognostic grade a strong proliferation a strong metastatic power and a worse prognosis than the other forms of breast cancer. It is however a heterogenous group for histological and molecular level but also for evolution. Most of the TN is part of the basal breast cancer subcategory. Until now the medical treatment is based on chemotherapy. Breast cancers by constitutional mutation of BRCA1 / BRCA2 (5 % of breast cancers) are mostly of basal type and their prognostic seems better that what could be expected from high grade tumours and without hormonal receptors. They would be much more frequent in the TN group. However at this day no prospective study was led to estimate this incidence or to study the intervention of other genes of predisposition as well to analyse the links between this phenotype and their consequences at the germinal or somatic level in terms of associated molecular changes and prognosis. The purpose of this study is on a prospective study to lead a joined analysis at the germinal level in search of mutations of the main genes of breast cancer predisposition (BRCA1/2 PALB2 PTEN PALB2) and at the tumour level (tissue micro-array and transcriptome) by correlating these results to the main clinical parameters.

Breast Cancer,Study of the Response to a Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Based on the Antitumor Immune Response in Localized Breast Cancer, This is a prospective non-randomized study which aims to evaluate the response to a neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to the the antitumor immune response in localized breast cancer. 40 patients will be enrolled in the study. They will receive chemotherapy : 3 or 4 anthracycline cycles or 3 or 4 FEC-100 cycles followed by 3 or 4 taxane cycles. Trastuzumab will be added to taxane for HER2+/Neu+ patients. Then patients will be operated and receive an adjuvant treatment which will both depend on the investigator's appreciation. Blood sample will be collected on the first day of the first chemotherapy cycle on the first day of the third cycle on surgery 6 months after the surgery and in case of relapse. Tumor sample will be collected on diagnosis as much as possible and on surgery. Patients will be followed during 5 years.    ,NCT01440413
Breast Cancer,Rural Women Connecting for Better Health, Women who are obese at breast cancer diagnosis have a 1.5 to 2.5 increased risk of recurrence and death compared to their normal weight counterparts. Moreover weight gain and decreased physical activity are common after diagnosis and also increase the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence and death. Rural women suffer from health disparities in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Women of the most rural counties also have the highest prevalence of obesity compared to urban women. To address these disparities the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop a clinically effective and cost efficient strategy for delivering a weight control intervention to rural breast cancer survivors. Group phone-based treatment via conference call is a novel treatment delivery approach that the investigators have shown to be effective for initial weight loss among rural breast cancer survivors and more effective than the standard individual phone-based approach among rural women. This innovative method of providing group treatment addresses access barriers in rural areas and may be especially ideal for rural breast cancer survivors because it provides social support in conjunction with a level of anonymity. However the impact of group phone counseling during extended care for weight loss maintenance beyond 6 months remains unknown. Weight loss maintenance is the more challenging phase of treatment when weight regain is common and this regain presents a potential risk for breast cancer recurrence. This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of group phone-based treatment for weight loss maintenance among rural breast cancer survivors compared to an established mail-based education comparison condition subsequent to a 6 month group phone-based weight loss phase for both conditions. In addition to the intervention impact on weight loss maintenance the study will provide estimates of incremental cost-effectiveness per kg loss between the two conditions and the impact on secondary outcomes including quality of life breast cancer risk biomarkers dietary intake and physical activity.    ,NCT01441011
Breast Cancer,Cabozantinib in Women With Metastatic Hormone-Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer, The study drug cabozantinib works by inhibiting several different proteins which are believed to be involved in breast cancer tumor growth its ability to spread and its ability to form new blood vessels.

The single agent portion of this study is now closed to accrual. This research study is now examining the efficacy of cabozantinib in combination with fulvestrant for treatment of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer that has spread to bone.    ,NCT01441947
Breast Cancer,111 Indium CHX-A DTPA Trastuzumab (Indium-Herceptin) for Imaging Breast Cancer, Background:   -  Some breast cancer cells have specific proteins (receptors) on their surface that make the tumor grow faster than normal cells. One of these receptors is called HER2/neu.   -  An FDA-approved drug called Herceptin attaches to HER2/neu if it is present on the cancer cell.   -  Indium-Herceptin is an agent in which a tiny amount of radioactivity called Indium has been attached to a tiny amount of Herceptin. Objectives: -To see if Indium-Herceptin provides information about the characteristics of the breast cancer in women whose tumors express HER2/neu and those whose tumors do not. Eligibility: -Women 18 years or older with primary or metastatic breast cancer who have not received treatment with herceptin for at least 6 months before enrollment into the study. Design:   -  Tissue from the patient s original breast or tumor biopsy is analyzed for HER2/neu status.   -  Patients have a physical examination and review of medical records.   -  Patients receive an injection of Indium-Herceptin followed by scanning with a gamma camera that detects the radioactivity in the Indium-Herceptin.   -  Patients return to the clinic 1 2 3 and 7 days later for repeat imaging to determine the best time to image after injection of Indium-Herceptin.   -  Blood samples are obtained every day of scanning to monitor the effects if any of the Indium-Herceptin and to see how fast the agent leaves the body.    ,NCT01445054
Breast Cancer,AZD2281 Plus Carboplatin to Treat Breast and Ovarian Cancer, Background:   -  Carboplatin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat cancer.   -  AZD2281 is an experimental drug in a class of agents called PARP inhibitors. PARP is a protein that is -involved in repairing DNA damage; PARP inhibitors interfere with that process. Objectives:   -  To determine the optimum doses of AZD2281 and carboplatin that can safely be used in patients with breast and ovarian cancer.   -  To evaluate the response of the tumor to the drug combination and determine the side effects of the treatment. Eligibility: -Patients 18 years of age or older with breast or ovarian cancer who have a family history of cancer or who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Design:   -  In this dose escalation study the first small group of patients receives the smallest study doses of AZD2281 and carboplatin. Subsequent groups receive incrementally higher doses of first AZD2281 and then carboplatin as long as the preceding group has not experienced unacceptable side effects. When the highest safe dose is determined additional patients receive that dose.   -  Patients receive treatment in 21-day cycles as follows: AZD2281 by mouth twice a day every day; carboplatin thorough a vein on day 8 of each cycle. Treatment may continue until it is no longer beneficial.   -  Evaluations during treatment include the following:   -  Physical examination 1 week after starting treatment and then every 3 weeks.   -  Blood tests weekly for the first 4 weeks of treatment and then every 3 weeks.   -  CT scans or other imaging tests such as ultrasound or MRI every 6 weeks to evaluate the tumor.    ,NCT01445418
Breast Cancer,Treatment Decision Impact of OncotypeDX??in HR+ N- Breast Cancer Patients, Primary objective: Determine the impact of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) on the treatment recommendation made (administration of chemotherapy or not in addition to hormonotherapy) in a HR+ N- or pN1(mi) Her2- breast cancer adjuvant population. The impact of Oncotype DX on treatment recommendations can be either a decrease in treatment intensity defined as a change in treatment recommendation from chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy to hormonal therapy alone or an increase in treatment intensity defined as a movement from hormonal therapy alone to the addition of chemotherapy to hormonal therapy. Patients with HR+ N- breast cancer currently represent around 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers. These are usually good prognosis tumors. However on the basis of classical clinical and pathological prognostic parameters and markers the international consensus guidelines recommend treatment with hormone- and chemotherapy in 85-95% of the cases. Considering the natural disease history such as documented by the EBCTCG meta-analysis more than 50% of these patients are overtreated which leads to unnecessary side effects and costs to the health system and to the society. Oncotype DX appears to be well adapted to therapeutic de-escalation as it targets HR+ N- patients and is performed on fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FPET). It is therefore best adapted to daily clinical practice as it does not necessitate any specific surgical procedure or tissue freezing. The prognostic and predictive value of Oncotype DX in ER+ N- patients has been validated on three large adjuvant randomized trials (NASBP B-14 NSABP B-20 and the ATAC study). The test has been commercially available in the USA since 2004 and is being used for more than 50% of the HR+ N- patients in this country. While Oncotype DX has been validated in the USA it needs to be independently evaluated in France in the context of the local treatment guidelines and habits to provide data that are meaningful to the French health system and to the French medical community.    ,NCT01446185
Breast Cancer,Phase IV Trial to Evaluate Breast Brachytherapy Using the Mammosite-Ml®, This study will evaluate the local control rate cosmetic results and complication rates of breast brachytherapy delivered using the MammoSite-ML® when used as the sole method of radiation therapy or as a boost technique for patients with stage I-II carcinoma of the breast (< 3 cm) (non-lobular histology) treated with lumpectomy with histologically negative surgical margins by at least 2 mm negative axillary lymph nodes and DCIS. Hypotheses:   -  For selected patients with stage I breast carcinoma and Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) radiation therapy delivered with brachytherapy alone using the MammoSite-ML® is technically feasible and reproducible with acceptable complication rates.   -  Cosmetic results after brachytherapy will be similar to that obtained after traditional whole breast external beam radiation therapy.   -  Local tumor control rate in the breast after brachytherapy will be similar to that of conventional external beam radiation therapy with less inconvenience and potentially less cost to the patient given the selection criteria which minimize the risk of clinically significant multicentric or extensive residual carcinoma following lumpectomy.    ,NCT01448447

Breast Cancer,Defining the Triple Negative Breast Cancer Kinome Response to GSK1120212, Research into treatments for breast cancer relies more and more on an understanding of how the cells of tumor tissue act when they are exposed to a new or different drug. To find these new or different drugs to treat cancer researchers are looking at proteins that help cancer cells grow such as a group of proteins called Kinases. In this study the investigators want to look at the activity of kinases when a particular experimental drug called GSK1120212 is administered. GSK1120212 blocks a kinase called MEK. GSK1120212 is not yet approved by the FDA for use in breast cancer patients. The investigators want to give subjects GSK1120212 for a short period of time (one week) to see how MEK and the other kinases function in cancer cells both before and after the study drug is given. This study is not intended to treat cancer it is looking at ways that the investigators may treat cancer in the future.    ,NCT01467310

Breast Cancer,Cosmetic and Functional Outcomes After Breast Conserving Surgery, The initial aesthetic and functional conditions are recorded with the help of the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS)an international validated questionnaire and the Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment - cosmetic results (BCCT.core) validated computer software allowing for comparison. Determination of the initial quality of life is measured with the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire number C30-BR23 (EORTC QoL C30-BR23). Patients then undergo surgical treatment according to institutional protocols. Following conventional marking of the orientation of the specimen it is measured by an analytical scale. Histological examination of the specimen will record the largest diameters and parameters of the lymph nodes according to the institutional protocol. On the 4th week following surgery assuming that wound healing is completed patients' data are again recorded in BCTOS BCCT.core and EORTC QoL C30-BR23. A third set of data are gained after completion of adjuvant radiotherapy on the 8th postoperative month. Magnetic resonance imaging is performed to assess the volume of the contralateral breast. Tumor - breast volume ratio is calculated and matched up with cosmetic results in each quadrant threshold value in the quadrants above of which it is not advisable to perform conventional breast conserving surgery due to poor outcomes.    ,NCT01496001

Breast Cancer,Epigenetic Testing for Breast Cancer Risk Stratification, Promoter region hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is one the earliest molecular events in malignant transformation and is readily detectable in apparently normal benign breast epithelium adjacent to breast cancers. The investigators hypothesize that DNA methylation of certain genes occurs as a field change in benign breast tissue that is at high risk for malignant transformation and as such can be exploited for tissue-based breast cancer risk stratification. Additional work is required to identify new DNA methylation markers potentially useful for periareolar fine needle aspiration (RP-FNA)-based breast cancer risk stratification to determine whether these markers are methylated more frequently in benign samples from women who develop breast cancer to determine whether assessment of these markers is reproducible to determine whether tamoxifen reduces DNA methylation and to better understand the pattern of DNA methylation in benign samples from unselected healthy control populations. Each of these objectives contributes to advancement of a clinically useful RP-FNA-based breast cancer risk stratification test. In addition identification of genes that are preferentially methylated in estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer will provide clues to the underlying biology responsible for this aggressive form of breast cancer. This knowledge may lead to the discovery of the causes of ER negative breast cancer approaches for recognizing women at increased risk for this type of breast cancer and approaches for reducing this risk. This study seeks to identify patterns of DNA methylation in benign breast epithelial cells associated with an increased risk for breast cancer with a focus on ER negative breast cancer.    ,NCT01501656
Breast Cancer,Pre-Operative Single-Dose Ipilimumab and/or Cryoablation in Early Stage/Resectable Breast Cancer," This study is being done to evaluate the safety of two strategies called ""cryoablation"" and ""immune therapy"" in women with curable early stage breast cancer. ""Cryoablation"" is a procedure performed by an expert doctor called a radiologist. The radiologist uses (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to insert a needle directly into a cancer. Very cold temperatures are then applied through the needle to kill the cancer cells. Some of the killed cancer cells will be broken into pieces that can be recognized by a person's immune system. The ""immune therapy"" in this study is a drug called ipilimumab. Normally the immune system makes ""T cells"" that can kill cancer cells when turned on. The cancer-killing T cell activity is controlled by a molecule called CTLA4. Ipilimumab works by turning off CTLA4. Turning off CTLA4 allows the cancer-fighting T cells to remain active Ipilimumab is an antibody drug has been made in a laboratory for patient use and was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with a type of skin cancer called melanoma. An antibody is a normal protein that the immune system uses to find and kill germs like bacteria and viruses. This study is being done because the researchers believe that when cryoablation is combined with immune therapy a person's immune system can be trained to recognize that person's cancer. This may prevent that cancer from coming back in the future. In other words it is hoped that by adding cryoablation with ipilimumab before the mastectomy the body will remain cancer free long after the mastectomy is performed. The first step in determining whether cryoablation and immune therapy can be used to cure breast cancer is to evaluate the safety of each strategy alone and then in combination in a small group of patients.

Breast Cancer,The Role of the Novel 99mTc-NC100692 Tracer in Patients at High Risk or Known Breast Cancer, Technetium-99m NC100692 Injection is under development as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for targeting angiogenesis associated with diseases such as primary and metastatic cancer and for targeting active fibrosis in cardiac diseases such as developing heart failure and developing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A principle goal of imaging is identification of disease processes early in their development at times prior to symptoms. In cancer angiogenesis is essential for a tumour to exceed approximately 1-2 mm3 in size.As markers of angiogenesis are often expressed early in the growth of a tumour it is postulated that imaging of angiogenesis can assist in early diagnosis of cancer relapse or spread and monitoring response to therapy. Technetium-99m NC100692 Injection will be tested on 3 populations of pts: 1.30 patients at high risk For breast cancer 2.30 patients with breast cancer 3.15 patients with locally advanced breast cancer undergoing treatment.    ,NCT01503697

Breast Cancer,Integrated Molecular Profiling in Advanced Cancers Trial, Substantial progress has been made in the treatment of cancer through the use of targeted therapies but what works for one patient might not work for another patient. Certain drugs are now being developed that target specific molecules in the body that are believed to be part of the disease. Biomarkers are specific characteristics of the cancer that may help provide prognostic information (i.e. how well patients will be regardless of the treatments given) or help predict sensitivity or resistance to a specific treatment. The study will collect archival tumor samples (previously collected biopsy or surgical tumor samples) to provide biomarker data about a patient's cancer in order to help their physicians to identify which clinical trials of molecularly targeted therapies may be most appropriate for the patient in the future.    ,NCT01505400
Breast Cancer,Weight Variation During Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients, Weight variation has been reported as a side effect of chemotherapy treatment in early breast cancer patients. To date there is growing evidence for an increased risk of relapse and death in these patients who gain or lose weight. However causes of weight variation during chemotherapy and mechanisms involved in the poor prognosis have been little studied. Thus the investigators are conducting a prospective study to characterize weight variation in terms of body composition and to identify the mechanisms involved.    ,NCT01506466

Breast Cancer,The Involvement of Breast Cancer Patients During Oncological Consultations, The main aim of the study is to assess if a pre consultation intervention facilitates greater participation of patients (and accompanying key persons when present) in the consultation process by determining an increase in questioning and/or in the number of different illness related issues (e.g. diagnosis treatment prognosis) being discussed with the oncologist. Other aims are to assess the effect of the intervention on the oncologist's level of patient involvement on patient satisfaction and coping and to explore the role of key persons accompanying the patient. The investigators expect that patients who have the opportunity to rehearse their informative needs before the consultation will ask a greater number of questions which in turn will determine their greater involvement by the physician and a greater number of satisfied needs. The investigators expect also that the straightforward use of a list of printed questions of potential relevance for cancer patients and their companions at an early stage of illness by modifying the process of information exchange increases their participation and satisfaction with the consultation with potential benefits for treatment adherence and consequently treatment efficacy.    ,NCT01510964
Breast Cancer,Efficacy of a Web-based Tailored Self-management Program, Life style interventions that promote exercise and a healthy diet which have the potential to improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL) may be particularly appropriate for cancer survivors. The previous studies suggested that a key strategy to implement sustainable healthy behavior and improve health was providing appropriate feedback and promoting self-efficacy. Web-based program enables to provide the feedback in a timely manner on a daily basis to continue the healthy behaviors. Therefore the investigators developed a web-based stage-matched Exercise and Diet Planning program and whether the program can promote significantly greater changes in behavioral outcomes [goal of exercise (energy expenditure of aerobic exercise ??12.5 kcal/kg/week) and diet (intake of vegetables ??5 serv/day and intake of fruit ??1 serv/day)] stage of changes for exercise and diet psychosocial outcomes (HRQOL fatigue anxiety and depression) and self-efficacy in implementing goal of exercise and diet among breast cancer survivors in Korea was examined. Hypotheses were following:   1. Survivors of a group participating in a web-based stage-matched Exercise and Diet Planning program (hereinafter called the 'intervention group') will show a more advanced stage of change for exercise and diet compared to survivors in the control group.   2. The intervention group will show a higher proportion of attaining goal of exercise (or higher level of energy expenditure of aerobic exercise) compared to the control group.   3. The intervention group will show a higher proportion of attaining goal of diet (or higher level of diet quality) compared to the control group.   4. The intervention group will show a better HRQOL level compared to the control group.   5. The intervention group will show a better self-efficacy level compared to the control group.   6. The intervention group will show a lower fatigue level compared to the control group.   7. The intervention group will show less anxiety compared to the control group.   8. The intervention group will show less depression compared to the control group.    ,NCT01512069

Breast Cancer,Relevance of T Lymphocytes Tumor Infiltrates CD8 and Foxp3 as Immune Prognostic Biomarker in Breast Cancer Treated by Neo Adjuvant Chemotherapy, Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is standard therapy for the management of localised breast cancer and makes it possible to evaluate tumour response. Achieving pathological complete response (pCR) after chemotherapy is the most important prognostic factor for these patients. However patients with pCR can suffer relapse. In parallel long-term prognosis of patients who do not achieve pCR is poorly documented and no specific prognostic factors have been clearly identified.Preclinical and clinical studies argue for an immunogenic role of some chemotherapy regimens such as anthracyclines taxanes or trastuzumab. By facilitating recruitment of CD8 T-lymphocytes in the tumour bed these agents could favourably influence antitumour immune response partially contributing to efficacy. Conversely tumours can promote accumulation of regulatory T-lymphocytes expressing Foxp3 thus evading anti-tumour immune response and increased numbers of regulatory T-cells are associated with less favourable prognosis in breast cancer patients. We have previously shown that a high number of CD8 T-cells associated with low Foxp3 infiltration as quantified by immunohistochemistry on surgical specimens is associated with better response and better survival in breast cancer patients independently of whether pCR was achieved the type of chemotherapy used and the type of breast cancer. Therefore we propose to validate in a prospective study this immunological prognostic marker in a large cohort of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    ,NCT01513408

Breast Cancer,The Preoperative Health & Body Study, This study is designed to look at the changes that occur in women who take part in exercise and Mind-Body programs between breast cancer diagnosis and breast surgery. The investigators will look at changes in stress anxiety mood and quality of life to see if these types of short programs can make women feel better during this time. The investigators are also interested in looking at whether a short exercise or Mind-Body program leads to any changes in markers in breast cancer cells such as their growth and death rates or in blood hormones such as insulin which have been linked to breast cancer development. Since the investigators do not know if these blood or tumor tests have any relationship to cancer recurrence the investigators do not plan to share the results of these tests with you or your physician.    ,NCT01516190
Breast Cancer,Testing a Spanish Version of a Patient Toxicity Questionnaire, Background:   -  The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is a list of toxicities and side effects that may occur when people are having cancer treatment. Doctors and nurses use this list to describe the side effects patients experience from cancer treatment. We have developed a questionnaire to ask people having cancer treatment directly about common symptoms and side effects and to supply this information to their doctors and nurses. This questionnaire is known as PRO-CTCAE and is completed by a patient.   -  PRO-CTCAE was originally developed in English. Researchers want to develop a Spanish version of the patient questionnaire. To test whether the questions are well understood and whether it is easy to complete the questionnaire the researchers will interview individuals whose primary language is Spanish and who are being treated for different types of cancer. Objectives: - To test a Spanish version of the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire. Eligibility: - Latinos at least 18 years of age who are having or have recently finished cancer treatments and whose main language is Spanish Design:   -  Participants will complete a questionnaire in Spanish with selected questions from the translated PRO-CTCAE. They will discuss their answers and any difficulties they might have had in understanding or answer the questions with an interviewer who will take notes and record comments and suggestions.   -  Literacy is not required for this study. Participants may opt to have the questions read aloud to them by an interviewer.    ,NCT01517152

Breast Cancer,Pilot Study of a Breast Cancer Vaccine Plus Poly-ICLC for Breast Cancer, Despite advances in surgical radiation and medical therapies of early stage breast cancer some patients will experience disease recurrence. Because recurrence may not happen for years after definitive treatment there is a period of time between resection and relapse when micrometastatic disease may be amenable to immune eradication or modulation. While the ultimate goal of any cancer treatment is clinical efficacy the immediate urgency in breast immunotherapy is to define treatments that have immunologic efficacy. In this study the investigators will determine whether a vaccine consisting of nine-class I breast specific peptides plus a class II tetanus toxoid helper peptide is immunogenic when administered with poly-ICLC to participants with stage IB to IIIA breast cancer in the adjuvant setting.    ,NCT01532960

Breast Cancer,Tracking & Feedback Registry to Reduce Breast Cancer Treatment Disparities," Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in women. Black women are less likely than white women to develop breast cancer but they are more likely to die of the disease. Some of this survival discrepancy is likely due to underuse of adjuvant therapies proven to increase survival. Breast cancer treatment often requires coordination among surgeons pathologists primary care physicians medical and radiation oncologists. In NYC black and Hispanic women who accessed care and underwent surgical treatment of their breast cancer were twice as likely as whites to experience underuse of adjuvant treatment. Disturbingly 1/3 of these underuse cases were episodes in which the surgeon recommended treatment the patient did not refuse and yet care did not ensue. Underuse in such circumstances is attributable to system failures than to specific provider or patient factors. In this proposed randomized controlled trial the investigators aim to test the effectiveness of a Tracking and Feedback (T&F) registry innovation to increase rates of completed oncology consultation and reduce both underuse of needed adjuvant therapy and racial disparities in receipt of these treatments. The investigators also aim to assess the feasibility of implementing a T&F Registry in these high-risk hospitals by evaluating implementation effectiveness for that innovation. The investigators have recruited 10 hospitals that serve large proportions of minority women with breast cancer. The investigators will randomize hospitals and aim to recruit 354 women with a new breast cancer 177 per intervention arm. The investigators choose these ""high risk"" hospitals because they serve predominantly minority populations and such hospitals have higher rates of the system failure cause of underuse and particularly the type of underuse targeted by our Tracking and Feedback Registry.

Breast Cancer,Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide Compared to Anthracycline-Based Chemotherapy in Treating Women With HER2-Negative Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of breast cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving the drugs in different combinations may kill more breast cancer cells. Giving combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying different combination chemotherapy regimens and their side effects and comparing how well they work in treating women with non-metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT01547741
Breast Cancer,Cancer Symptom Data From Multiple Treatment Centers, Background: - Cancer and cancer treatments can cause symptoms and side effects. Pain fatigue and emotional distress are three common symptoms. Accurate reporting of these symptoms can improve treatment methods and outcomes. Even though symptom reporting is important to treatment there is no method to collect and compare patient data from multiple cancer care centers. Researchers want to develop a method for collecting cancer patient symptom information from multiple centers. This method may help improve cancer treatment at hospitals and other care centers. Objectives: - To collect patient-reported symptom information from multiple cancer care centers. Eligibility:   -  Individuals at least 21 years of age who were treated for breast or colon cancer in the past year.   -  Participants will come from one of the participating cancer care centers. Design:   -  Participants will answer a short questionnaire about their symptoms during cancer treatment. Questions will ask about symptom severity and experiences. Other questions will ask how well the doctors and nurses managed the symptoms.   -  Participant responses will be compared with other medical and personal information. This information may include cancer type age at diagnosis and type of treatment.   -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.    ,NCT01547845
Breast Cancer,Effects of a Dexmedetomidine on Quality of Recovery 40 and Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Breast Cancer Surgery, Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common following beast surgery. Dexmedetomidine was reported to a reduced PONV due to opioid-sparing effect. It is not clear if dexmedetomidine itself is useful on reducing PONV.

Breast Cancer,The Use of Laser-Assisted Indocyanine Green Dye Angiography to Predict Mastectomy Skin Flap Viability, In the investigators previous study of 51 breast reconstructions (32 patients) we compared three different assessments of vascular perfusion of tissue; clinical judgment fluorescein dye angiography (FDA) and laser-assisted indocyanine green dye angiography (ICG). Because tissue with poor perfusion becomes necrotic and can compromise the success of breast reconstruction it is important that tissue with poor perfusion be removed at the time of the reconstructive surgery. However it is also important to remove the least amount of potentially necrotic tissue as possible so that the breast reconstruction is not compromised by lack of skin. Therefore finding the best way to assess potentially necrotic tissue is a vital clinical question. In the initial study the 3 different assessment methods which were made at the time of surgery were compared to the subsequent development of necrotic tissue. In the initial study clinical judgment was the basis for determining the tissue removed because it had the potential to become necrotic. The investigators collected data with the FDA system and ICG system but this data was not used in making the clinical decisions. The study followed the progression of tissue to overt necrosis and this clinical outcome was then compared to the predictions made by the three different assessment strategies. The investigators found that clinical judgment failed to detect tissue which subsequently became necrotic in 21 out of 51 instances for a failure rate of 41%. The FDA system predicted larger areas of potentially necrotic tissue than clinical judgment but was found to over-predict the area that became necrotic by 82% - 88% (88% if all cases were included and 82% if only those cases which subsequently developed necrosis were included). Although the ICG system is similar to the FDA system in that a dye is used to assess perfusion the ICG system has enhanced software which improves the estimated perfusion. The ICG system provided 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the predicted vs. actual necrotic tissue at specific absolute perfusion units values. Hypothesis: Using the values of absolute perfusion units discovered in the previous study and implementing its use in the operating room will decrease all-inclusive necrosis rates to below 10% reflecting a 31% decrease in the investigators necrosis rate.    ,NCT01554267
Breast Cancer,Late Cardiac Evaluation of the Three Arm Belgian Trial Involving Node-positive Early Breast Cancer Patients, Late Cardiac Evaluation of the Three Arm Belgian Trial A phase III randomized trial involving node-positive early breast cancer patients with a long median follow-up (~ 15 years) OBJECTIFS Primary: ??To compare the incidence of late cardiac events between anthracycline and non-anthracycline chemotherapy given to node-positive breast cancer patients in the Belgian three arm randomized clinical trial Secondary:   -  To compare the late incidence of cardiac events between higher and lower dose anthracycline treated node-positive breast cancer patients;   -  To compare anthracyclines (higher and lower doses) and non-anthracycline chemotherapy for:   -  left ventricular diastolic function assessed by Echo   -  exercise capacity assessed by 6-minute walk test (6MWT)   -  cardiac morphology (myocardial inflammation or injury fibrosis LVEF) assessed by MRI   -  serum cardiac biomarkers (BNP and TNT)   -  patient-reported cardiac symptoms   -  patient-reported cardiac symptoms assessed by QOL questionnaires are associated with subclinical findings on LVEF assessment   -  cognitive function functional autonomy and psychological distress    ,NCT01554943
Breast Cancer,Stress Management in Breast Cancer Patients, The purpose of this study within Caring sciences is to identify women with breast cancer who have stress symptoms and to offer these women appropriate care to reduce stress and increase well-being. This will be achieved by   1. Studying the prevalence of stress related symptoms in female patients with breast cancer   2. Testing the use of two short screening instruments to identify women at risk for developing long-standing stress symptoms   3. Studying the level and intensity of stress management interventions required to achieve increased well-being using a stepped-care approach.   4. Studying the effects of interventions based on cognitive behavior therapy delivered individually or in a group format. The hypothesis is that half of the individuals assigned to a low intensity intervention will be significantly improved after treatment. For individuals who continue to have symptoms after low intensity treatment it is hypothesized that continued treatment in a group setting with high intensity interventions will be more cost-effective. In addition the assumption is that reduction of stress symptoms in women with breast cancer will lead to a reduction in socio-economic costs.    ,NCT01555645
Breast Cancer,Breast-Conserving Surgery and Radiation Therapy in Patients With Multiple Ipsilateral Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Breast-conserving surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for breast cancer and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery.

Breast Cancer,Fulvestrant With or Without Ganetespib in HR+ Breast Cancer," Ganetespib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. This drug has been used in other research studies and laboratory experiments. It has also been studied in phase I trials where the appropriate dosing has been determined. Ganetespib is considered an ""HSP90 inhibitor"". By blocking HSP90 ganetespib is thought to reduce the ability of cancer cells to become resistant to treatment. Fulvestrant is a hormonal therapy that works by attaching to estrogen receptors. In doing so it can block the effect of estrogen on cancer cells. In addition fulvestrant causes a decrease in the number of estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant is a drug that is approved by the FDA for treatment of metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer based upon the results of phase III clinical trials. In the laboratory adding ganetespib to fulvestrant appears to improve its effectiveness. It is not known whether this is true in humans. In this research study we are evaluating the effect of the addition of ganetespib to fulvestrant in participants with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.    ",NCT01560416
Breast Cancer,Predictors of Response to Neoadjuvant Docetaxel-Carboplatin Chemotherapy for Patients With Stage II and III Triple Negative Breast Cancer, Neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy is an interesting research tool which allows investigators to test new drugs and/or new schedules with a validated surrogate endpoint pCR. It also represents an ideal model to evaluate the relationships between treatments and tumor biomarkers. Recent publications have shown that new molecular classifications of breast cancer (intrinsic subtypes) have an important prognostic and predictive value. Using microarrays for gene expression profiling seems to be the best way to perform this classification; nevertheless such assays are not optimally available for common clinical practice. The IHC-based classification systems are still useful as fresh tissue is not normally available in clinical practice and has been shown to correlate well with intrinsic classification using gene expression microarrays. Recently the PAM50 gene set provided a risk of relapse score not only in ER-positive node negative patients (similarly to the Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score) but also in the ER negative disease. Additionally the PAM 50 assay was highly predictive of neoadjuvant response when considering all patients. This assay added significant prognostic and predictive value to pathologic staging histologic grade and standard clinical molecular markers while using an easy technique that can be performed in clinical practice because the qRT-PCR assay can be performed using FFEP tissue. Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of ER PgR and HER-2. DNA microarray profiling studies have led to the classification of invasive breast carcinoma into five subtypes: luminal A and B normal breast-like HER2/neu overexpressing and basal-like subtypes with clinical implications. Later on a new subtype the claudin-low has been described. Although not synonymous the majority of TNBCs carry the basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) molecular profile. The triple negative subtype accounts for 11-20% of breast cancer in different studies whereas in selected cohorts of patients with advanced breast cancer or African-American ethnicity TNBC may be diagnosed among as many as 23-28%. Patients with TN breast tumors treated with standard chemotherapy have a shorter DFS and OS than non-TNBC this difference have been shown to be independent from tumor grade nodal status and treatment in some studies. The peak risk of recurrence occurs within the first 3 years after initial treatment with the majority of deaths occurring in the first five years. Chemotherapy remains the only systemic treatment option available for TNBC patients. Several studies have shown that TNBC/BLBC is associated with an increased response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy when compared with luminal tumors. However TNBC patients have a significantly decreased DFS and OS in comparison with luminal patients. The largest study exploring response and survival in early stage breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy was reported by Liedtke et al. Although an increase pCR rate was observed among the TNBC patients they had a shorter lifespan than the non-TN ones. Patients experiencing pCR had an excellent OS regardless of hormone receptor expression but patients with residual disease had a significantly shorter survival associated with TNBC compared with non-TN ones. This demonstrates that poor OS is derived from chemo-resistant patients (what unfortunately represent > 50% of them). A relevant problem is the differential response to drugs of TN tumors. These tumors are usually treated with multidrug combinations including anthracyclines and taxanes with pCR´s of 28-32%. Only recently the results of a few small trials combining platinum salts and taxanes have been reported with encouraging results (pCR of 44-77%). The taxane-platinum salt combinations have a biological background since TN not associated BRCA1 mutations are sensitive to taxanes and resistant to anthracyclines and platinum salts are effective in TN tumors probably because a significant proportion of them have functional DNA repair deficiencies. The primary objective of the study is to identify predictors of response to docetaxel-carboplatin in patients with triple negative primary tumors. Response is defined as lack of invasive tumor in breast plus axilla after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (PCR pathological complete response).    ,NCT01560663

Breast Cancer,External-Beam Partial-Breast Irradiation for Early Breast Cancer 40 Gy QD Over 2 Weeks," Standard therapy for patients with early stage breast cancer consists of surgery to remove the cancer followed by radiation therapy. One question regarding radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer is whether the entire breast needs to be radiated or only a more limited area surrounding the tumor. Whole-breast irradiation (WBI) is radiation therapy given to the whole breast. Partial-breast irradiation (PBI) is radiation therapy given only to the area of the breast where the cancer was removed (called the ""tumor bed""). The investigators hope the option of PBI will reduce side effects from radiation therapy and shorten the radiation treatment process when compared to WBI since only part of the breast is being treated. The investigators also hope that this will make such treatment more convenient for breast cancer patients. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the the safety of external-beam PBI in selected early breast cancer patients utilizing PBI in ten daily fractions over two weeks. The investigators will also evaluate the local control and the cosmetic results.    ",NCT01581619

Breast Cancer,Early Rehabilitation of Cancer Patients, A life threatening disease such as cancer may lead to post traumatic stress disorder and even when reporting low levels of side-effects from cancer disease and treatment 80% report high levels of stress symptoms. The purpose of the present randomised controlled trial is to examine the psychosocial effects of a stress management intervention based on cognitive behaviour therapy and with focus on increased physical activity in patients with various cancer diagnoses using a stepped-care approach. When using a stepped-care approach it is possible to study the level and intensity of stress management intervention required to achieve increased well-being. A cost-utility analysis will also be performed. 300 adult patients with a recent diagnosis of breast- colorectal- prostate testicular cancer or lymphoma and scheduled for adjuvant and/or curative oncologic treatment at Haukeland University Hospital will be consecutively included in the prospective intervention study. The patients will be randomized to intervention or control. In step 1 all patients in the intervention group (I-a) will receive 2 counselling sessions. Patients who report clinically significant levels of stress such as intrusive thoughts/avoidance behaviour (measured by Impact of Event Scale) and/or worry and depressions (measured by Hospital and Depression Scale) will be included in Step 2 (I-b) and include another 4-7 counselling sessions. There will also be a focus on motivating to increase physical activity level. Both the intervention (I) and control group (C) are allowed to take part in the common rehabilitation program with patient education and physical training. Data will be collected with self-reported standardized questionnaires. Objectively measures of physical activity level sleep and daily energy expenditure are recorded with SenseWear??Pro3 Armband.

Breast Cancer,Safety and Efficacy of BKM120 and Lapatinib in HER2+/PI3K-activated Trastuzumab-resistant Advanced Breast Cancer, This study is based upon the following points:   1. Resistance to trastuzumab either primary or secondary is a clinically relevant issue.   2. PI3K/AKT activation due to loss of expression/function of PTEN and/or activating mutations of PIK3CA is a mechanism of resistance with clinical relevance in breast cancer. Such activation can be detected by:   -  IHC evaluation of PTEN protein expression   -  genotyping of PIK3CA exon 9 and 20   -  IHC evaluation of phospho-AKT expression   3. BKM120 is an effective PI3K inhibitor. BKM120 and anti-HER2 therapy may have a synergistic antitumor activity in preclinical model of HER2+ breast cancer.   4. Lapatinib is an effective anti-HER2 therapy in trastuzumab-resistant disease.   5. For the evaluation of novel targeted therapies selecting a patient population enriched for activation of the target to be modulated should allow to maximize the differences in clinical outcome that are expected in the experimental arm and thus to minimize the patient number to include.   6. We propose to test in a phase I/II study the combination of lapatinib and BKM120 in trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ MBC patients enriched for activation of PI3K/AKT as detected by loss of expression of PTEN (IHC) and/or mutation of PIK3CA and/or overexpression of phospho-AKT (IHC). Only for phase II patients mutational status will be an inclusion criteria. For phase I patients molecular status will be a retrospective exploratory analysis.    ,NCT01589861
Breast Cancer,Botulinum Toxin A (Botox) in Tissue Expander Breast Reconstruction, Each year the number of breast cancer survivors who choose post-mastectomy breast reconstruction keeps rising. Among women who elect to pursue breast reconstruction approximately 75% will choose prosthetic breast reconstruction. Implant-based breast reconstruction is frequently achieved in two-stages. The first stage consists of the placement of a tissue expander after mastectomy. This is followed by a period of biweekly tissue expansions that can last several months. In the second stage the tissue expander is removed in a surgical procedure and replaced with a permanent breast implant. Tissue expansion is a well-established breast reconstruction technique characterized by high success rates and high patient satisfaction. Despite the well-recognized advantages of this successful breast reconstruction technique the subpectoral placement of a tissue expander is associated with significant pain and discomfort in the immediate post-operative period and during the phase of tissue expansion. Pectoralis major muscle spasm is a frequently reported problem during tissue expansion. Legeby et al. recently showed that women who underwent prosthetic breast reconstruction had higher pain scores and took more analgesics that those who did not choose post-mastectomy reconstruction. In the past 10 years publications on the use of BTX-A for pain relief in a wide array of clinical conditions have increased tremendously. BTX-A is one of the neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. By reversibly inhibiting neurotransmitter release BTX-A has both analgesic and paralytic properties. The analgesic action of BTX-A was initially thought to be related to its effects on muscular contraction. However a recent in vitro study of embryonic rat dorsal neurons did confirm that BTX-A inhibits release of substance P a neurotransmitter associated with pain and inflammatory reactions. The presence of analgesic properties of BTX-A is increasingly supported by several clinical observations: pain relief with BTX-A injections has been reported for migraine headaches chronic pelvic chronic tennis elbow and post-operative pain control for lower limb lengthening correction among others. This aspect has never been studied in breast cancer survivors who elect to pursue breast reconstruction with tissue expanders. Furthermore physical function outcomes are important to consider with BTX-A use because the link between temporary muscle paralysis and improvements in participation in daily activities is not a given. The investigators propose to complete a double-blinded prospective randomized controlled trial of women undergoing unilateral and bilateral mastectomies with immediate placement of tissue expanders to establish the efficacy and safety of BTX-A in alleviating pain and in improving physical well-being during the expansion period.    ,NCT01591746

Breast Cancer,PiA: Prognosis Used Every Day for Patients With Operable Breast Cancer - Comparison of Invasion Factors uPA/PAI-1 With Other Prognostic Factors," The improvement of the healing rates for breast cancer is based to an important part on the consistent use of so-called adjuvant (""supporting "") medicamentous therapies including chemotherapy. However this success has a price due to still inaccurate knowledge of the individual risk of relapse: a high number of unnecessary therapies are applied (over-therapy!). The invasion factors uPA (plasminogen activator of the urokinase type) and PAI-1 (uPA inhibitor) were described extensively as strong and independent prognosis factors with high clinical relevance for patients with node negative breast cancer. Compared to clinical and pathological factors (further: ""traditional factors "") they show better estimation of the relapse risk leading to an avoidance of redundant adjuvant chemotherapy and may thus essentially contribute to the improvement of the quality of life in these women. In this study we aim to evaluate how large the portion of the patients with early operable node negative breast cancer will be in whom by improved low-risk identification through uPA/PAI-1 adjuvant chemotherapy can be omitted.

Breast Cancer,Neoadjuvant Study of Sequential Eribulin Followed by FAC Compared to Sequential Paclitaxel Followed by FEC in Early Stage Breast Cancer Not Overexpressing HER-2, The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if and how well eribulin given in combination with standard chemotherapy can treat early-stage breast cancer compared to paclitaxel given in combination with standard chemotherapy. In this study the standard chemotherapy being given is either 5-fluorouracil epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (called FEC) or 5-fluorouracil doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (called FAC). Eribulin is a changed version of the structure of a natural substance from a sea sponge. It is designed to block cells from dividing which may cause cancer cells to die. Paclitaxel is designed to block cancer cells from dividing which may cause them to die. 5-fluorouracil is designed to block cancer cells from growing and dividing which may slow or stop their growth and spread throughout the body. This may cause the cancer cells to die. Epirubicin is designed to block the way cancer cells grow and divide which may slow or stop their growth and spread throughout the body. This may cause the cancer cells to die. Doxorubicin is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells which may cause the cells to die. Cyclophosphamide is designed to interfere with the multiplication of cancer cells which may slow or stop their growth and/or keep them from spreading throughout the body. This may cause the cancer cells to die.    ,NCT01593020
Breast Cancer,Prospective Chart-Review: Impact of Combination - Digital Breast Tomosynthesis + Digital Mammography, Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is a technology that has been developed to improve lesion detection in dense breasted women. Even though DBT has been regarded as a study for dense breasted women it may also improve lesion detection at an earlier stage and smaller size in women with less dense breast tissue. The overlapping of tissue on a standard of care 2D mammogram leads to decreased cancer detection it also contributes to pseudo lesions that mimic cancers. This leads to patients being asked to come back for additional imaging including mammogram and/or ultrasound images. DBT has shown to decrease call back rates by up to 43% in reader studies. Even though these results are promising they were not done in a realistic clinical setting.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the FDA-approved combination standard digital mammography (DM) and DBT technology and its impact on our clinical practice.    ,NCT01593384
Breast Cancer,A Prospective Study to Evaluate the Effect of Systemic Adjuvant Therapy on the Cognitive Function of Breast Cancer Patients, The primary objective of this prospective pilot study is to examine the variation of cognitive function at various time-points in stage I-III breast cancer patients who have undergone or are undergoing adjuvant systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or anti-hormonal therapy) and compare this to a group of healthy controls to evaluate if there is a difference. All randomized patients and their respective controls would be required to complete the computerized neuropsychological assessment CANTAB at certain time-points.These patients and controls would also be given on the same day as CANTAB testing a set of questionnaires to evaluate subjective factors such as anxiety depression fatigue or menopausal symptoms which may also have an effect on cognition. Subjective assessment of cognitive function will rely on self-reporting by study participants using a validated questionnaire.The potential risks to subjects are minimal as this is a study without any intervention regarding the medical management of patients. By participating in this study subjects will be helping in the aim of determining if there is cognitive impairment post-therapy and if so how prevalent is this phenomenon when it arises and how it changes with time. This will consequentially play an important role with regard to patient knowledge. Furthermore if chemotherapy is shown to be associated with cognitive impairment further studies can be carried out to determine the exact pathophysiology behind this phenomenon. This will allow for sensitive and timely detection of cognitive dysfunction in patients who have received chemotherapy and/or anti-hormonal therapy and subsequently open the avenue for research in preventing or alleviating this phenomenon. This is crucial in improving patients' quality of life social and occupational performance. The investigators hypothesis is that systemic adjuvant therapy in the form of chemotherapy and/or anti-hormonal therapy given to primary breast cancer patients can cause cognitive impairment.    ,NCT01596439

Breast Cancer,Interventions to Increase Screening by Breast Cancer Survivors and Their High Risk Female Relatives, The University of Michigan (UM) Schools of Nursing Public Health and Medicine the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) and the Michigan Cancer Consortium (MCC) are conducting a multidisciplinary academic/practice three-year project to increase appropriate breast cancer screening for young breast cancer survivors and their cancer-free female relatives at greatest risk for breast cancer. The aims of this project are to: 1) identify and survey 3000 breast cancer survivors reported to the Michigan Cancer Surveillance Program who were diagnosed between the ages of 20-45 years regarding their breast cancer screening utilization; 2) identify and survey the survivors' female relatives regarding their breast cancer screening utilization; and 3) implement two versions (targeted vs. enhanced tailored) of an evidence-based intervention recommended by the Guide to Community Preventive Services to increase breast cancer screening. A follow-up survey will assess the effectiveness of each intervention on a) breast cancer screening utilization; b) perceived barriers and facilitators to screening; c) self-efficacy in utilizing screening services; d) family support related to screening; e) knowledge of the genetics of breast cancer and personal risk factors; and f) satisfaction with the intervention.    ,NCT01612338

Breast Cancer,Treatment for Joint Pains Due to Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy in Breast Cancer, Aromatase inhibitors are the most effective adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) post-menopausal breast cancer patients with proven superiority over tamoxifen in terms of disease-free survival time to recurrence and contralateral breast cancer. However approximately half of the women who take this drug will develop significant joint pains termed Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Arthralgia (AIA). Though this medicine should be taken for 5 years the joint pain can be so troublesome that up to 13% may prematurely discontinue it because of the arthralgia thus sacrificing their best chance of recurrence-free survival. Nonetheless neither the etiology nor optimal management of AIA is clearly understood leaving both doctor and patient rather frustrated. The investigators therefore propose to test the hypothesis that AIA can be effectively treated by a new clinical algorithm and that effective treatment of the problem will lead to improved compliance with Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) therapy. The algorithm is a clinical pathway for treating AIA which incorporates in a rational and step-wise manner a series of interventions based on the available evidence. Interventions include acupuncture pain medication weight bearing exercise and other commonly used therapies for AIA. The investigators will enroll 100 women who are beginning adjuvant AI therapy and assess each woman's baseline joint pains via a questionnaire as well as grip strength measurement. The investigators will then periodically repeat these tests during AI therapy in order to systematically quantify and characterize AIA. Those women who develop AIA during the course of the study will be placed on the clinical algorithm and the investigators will observe whether their joint pains significantly improve (as measured by questionnaire and grip strength measurement) after institution of the algorithm. The investigators will also determine whether their compliance is improved compared to historical controls and at least non-inferior to the women in the study who do not develop AIA. Finally the investigators will measure serum estrogen level at baseline and then periodically during AI therapy to investigate whether more dramatic decline in estrogen level after initiation of an AI leads to significant AIA and earlier time to onset. This study targets a very common cause of pain among breast cancer survivors and aims to offer an effective treatment strategy to alleviate pain and improve quality of life as well as medication compliance.    ,NCT01612728

Breast Cancer,Tumor Specific Plasma DNA, In 2011 there was an estimated 233000 cases of invasive breast cancer and 39970 deaths from breast cancer in the United States. The vast majority of patients are diagnosed with Stage I-III resectable and potentially curable disease and for these patients the most pressing questions are whether adjuvant endocrine or chemotherapy are indicated and if so how to determine whether these treatments are working. Adjuvant systemic therapy reduces relative recurrence rates by 30-50% depending on the age of the patient and tumor characteristics. However patients with early stage disease often do not bear measurable markers of disease such as an elevated cancer antigen 27-29 (CA27.29) or circulating tumor cells. Patients with early stage breast cancer are typically treated with adjuvant therapy based on historical evidence showing that such therapy prolongs survival in this population. Lung cancer is the most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. Approximately 220000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. every year. Unfortunately lung cancers are often diagnosed at later stages than breast cancer due in part to little/no effective screening for lung cancer. As with breast cancer patients are commonly treated with chemotherapeutic agents but treatment regimens can take several weeks to months to elicit clinically detectable anti-tumor effects. A biomarker to assess early tumor response to therapy would benefit this patient population. The contents of dying tumor cells can be detected in the bloodstream and this may be enhanced by the leaky vasculature of solid tumors. Protein biomarkers of tumor cell death are difficult to detect due to the complex nature of plasma and the lack of technical sensitivity. In contrast DNA is easier to detect through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Indeed circulating tumor DNA has been detected in plasma from patients with osteosarcoma breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Until recently it was impractical to develop an assay to routinely quantify circulating tumor DNA due to heterogeneity between patients and tumors. Advances in genomic technology now permit sequencing a tumor genome to identify patient-specific genomic aberrations. Major genomic alterations (i.e. insertions amplifications deletions inversions translocations) can be readily detected using PCR primers which will recognize tumor DNA but not normal DNA. While this strategy may be generally applicable to diverse types of solid tumors two issues are apparent in breast cancer. Firstly the incidence of chromosomal rearrangements varies widely. Whole-genome sequencing of 15 breast tumors revealed a range of 1-231 major genomic alterations (mean= 68) where 2 tumors had 1 alteration and 9 tumors had > 20 alterations. Single-base point mutations are more common but difficult to reliably detect using PCR. Therefore the investigators must consider that a small subset of patients may have a limited number of genomic alterations available for this assay. Secondly intratumoral heterogeneity may mean that some genomic alterations are not present in every tumor cell. Such heterogeneity has been inferred from FISH and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies for many years and is now being verified at the genomic level. The investigators must consider that only a subpopulation of tumor cells may be sensitive to cytotoxic therapy so changes in the levels of circulating tumor DNA may only be reflected with analysis of genomic alterations specific to the sensitive cells.    ,NCT01617915
Breast Cancer,Pre-Operative Radiation and Veliparib for Breast Cancer, The investigators' primary aim is to determine the number of participants who can handle the treatment within specific safety parameters determine the number of participants who can handle safely the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (within 50-200 mg/BID dose range) when combining Veliparib and radiation as well as to identify side effects and their intensity at different dosing levels. The investigators' secondary aim is to determine the number of participants with post-operative adverse events associated with POPI as well as the pathologic complete and partial response rate in patients treated with POPI. The investigators' exploratory aim is to serially assess apoptosis/proliferation biomarkers and gene and protein expression profiles for correlation with tumor response to POPI. This will be primarily evaluated in the expansion cohort. Study Plan: It will be a standard 3+3 dose finding trial in which the MTD will be defined as the dose below the level at which >1 DLT is observed in 3-6 patients. Women with node positive disease prior to NAC and >1.0 cm residual breast disease and/or clinically positive nodal disease after NAC will be offered participation in the research phase of this study. Women with residual disease >1cm or +LN after NAC (Med Onc's choice) will be offered pre-operative Veliparib and concurrent whole breast and regional nodal irradiation. Four (4) dose levels of Veliparib will be evaluated with concurrent whole breast and regional nodal irradiation (WB/RNI). The starting dose of Veliparib will be 50 mg BID will increase in 50 mg increments to a maximum of 200 mg BID and be delivered concurrently with 235 cGy QD x 16 to the breast and SCV/Axilla. Once the MTD is determined we will further evaluate safety with an expansion cohort which will bring the total number of patients treated at the MTD to 20. Accrual: Up to 44 patients    ,NCT01618357
Breast Cancer,Knowledge and Attitudes of Patients and Healthcare Professionals on a Spectrum of Genetic Tests Relevant to Breast Cancer Patients, Objectives: Primary objectives: ??The investigators aim to conduct a questionnaire survey in a South-East Asian tertiary institution to assess whether breast cancer patients and their physicians would consider the use of three different kinds of genetic tests currently available to breast cancer patients:   -  BRCA1/2 germline testing   -  CYP2D6 genotyping and   -  Oncotype DX® testing. Secondary objectives: To explore factors which might influence their decisions on genetic testing including:   1. Acceptability of the tests and anti-cancer management based on the test results   2. Reliability and affordability of the test   3. Ability of the test to influence treatment decisions   4. Broader implications of the test e.g. psychosocial financial impact Study design: Cross-sectional study Survey Questionnaires were developed for 3 categories of individuals:   -  Patients with early stage breast cancer   -  Healthcare professionals caring for breast cancer patients   -  Medical students /cancer researchers The questionnaires for patients and medical students/cancer researchers are similar. The questionnaires contain a brief section on demographic information interest in and past experience with genetic testing. Three hypothetical situations are described to determine if participants will agree to BRCA1/2 testing CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX® testing respectively. 18 categorical 'yes'/ 'no' questions explore reasons for their decisions. Each scenario requires a short hand-written response. The questionnaire for healthcare professionals contains a brief section on demographics and past experience with genetic testing. Three hypothetical situations are described to determine if healthcare professionals will recommend their patients for BRCA1/2 testing CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX® testing respectively. 12 categorical questions explore the reasons for their decision and physicians are required to rank these in order of importance. Distribution of questionnaires: Questionnaires will be handed out to agreeable participants on the following occasions:   1. Patients- National University Health System Cancer Centre Level 3 amp; 4 waiting areas   2. Medical students - before or after lectures or at personal contact   3. Cancer researchers - before or after lectures or at personal contact   4. Healthcare professionals - before or after NUHS breast tumour board or at personal contact Due caution will be exercised to ensure that the questionnaire is only handed out to subjects who are aged 21 years and above. No subject identity will be collected for these questionnaires. Rationale and Hypothesis: BRCA1/2 germline testing CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX® testing have all been approved for use in clinical practice but controversy still exists surrounding their utility and apart from BRCA1/2 mutation testing in high-risk individuals genetic tests are not routinely performed in Singapore. BRCA1/2 germline mutation testing is performed in individuals at high risk for hereditary cancer. CYP2D6 genotype testing predicts the benefit of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy; poor and intermediate metabolisers of tamoxifen may have a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence due to lower efficacy of tamoxifen because of less efficient conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen the active metabolite of tamoxifen. Oncotype DX® testing is a gene-expression profiling test performed on a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumour specimen to predict the risk of breast cancer recurrence and guide decisions on adjuvant chemotherapy. Understanding the attitudes of patients and medical professionals toward these genetic tests may help to guide medical oncologists in their clinical recommendations and utilization of these tests in breast cancer patients.    ,NCT01619306
Breast Cancer,Uncovering Potential Breast Cancer Biomarkers Amp; Possible Drug Targets Using Advanced Quantitative Mass Spectrometry, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of advanced quantitative mass spectometry (Super SILAC) as a discovery platform to uncover novel protein biomarkers in tumor and to compare the protein profile between different subtypes of breast cancer (ER positive HER2 positive triple negative). A maximum of 100 breast tumor specimens will be obtained from the NUHS Tissue repository comprising approximately equal proportion of ER positive HER2 positive and triple negative tumors. Samples will be analyzed using advanced Mass Spectrometry (Super SILAC) as a discovery platform to identify novel protein biomarkers that may be important in cancer. DNA and RNA will also be extracted from tumor samples for correlative analysis with the proteomics data. Genomics and proteomics data will be correlated with clinical data including treatment response and survival data. Importance of proposed research to science or medicine:Identification of tumor biomarkers may allow better prognostication follow-up and selection of treatment for cancer patients in the future. Potential benefits and risks: No direct benefit to the patient. Risk to the subjects is minimal as there is no direct patient contact and analysis is done on previously donated tumor samples. Patients have previously provided consent to donate their samples for research into the NUHS Tissue Repository. Novel tumor biomarkers that determine tumor biology including prognosis and treatment sensitivity may be detectable using the novel advanced quantitative mass spectromy method (Super SILAC). Different subtypes of breast cancers will have different proteomic profiles analyzed using super SILAC.    ,NCT01619514

Breast Cancer,Multidisciplinary Team IntervenTion in CArdio-ONcology (TITAN Study), People with breast cancer and lymphoma often experience many short and long-term side effects as a result of both the cancer and the necessary treatments. Receiving extra assessments and care from teams of multiple health professionals has been shown to be helpful for people with other health problems such as heart disease. These 'multidisciplinary' teams may include nurses doctors pharmacists dietitians exercise therapists counselors and other specialists. Currently the investigators do not know if receiving extra assessments from a multidisciplinary team is helpful for people receiving cancer treatment. In this study the investigators hope to learn the effect of extra assessments and early interventions from teams of health care professionals in people diagnosed with cancer during and after the treatment period. After initial assessments participants will be randomized to multidisciplinary team intervention or usual care.    ,NCT01621659

Breast Cancer,Metabolizing Enzyme Genotype Versus Exemestane Metabolism Profiles, It is the investigators hypothesis that exemestane (EXE) metabolism is an important source of the inter-individual variation in EXE metabolic profiles and that polymorphisms in EXE-metabolizing enzymes may potentially play a role in affecting EXE therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. The goals of this clinical study are to (1) establish EXE metabolism profile kinetics and (2) determine whether correlations exist in vivo between metabolizing enzyme genotype and urinary EXE metabolite profiles in women being treated with EXE. Together these studies will allow us to fully characterize functionally-relevant polymorphisms in the EXE-metabolizing enzyme pathway that are potentially important in EXE clinical efficacy.    ,NCT01626144
Breast Cancer,Exemestane-RAD001-Metformin, The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if exemestane and everolimus combined with metformin can help to control breast cancer in patients who are obese or overweight and post-menopausal with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Exemestane is designed to decrease the ability of estrogen to help cancer cells grow. This could cause the cancer cells to die. Metformin is commonly used to control blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes. It is designed to lower insulin levels which may slow or stop the growth of breast cancer cells. Everolimus is designed to block cells from dividing. This may cause cancer cells to die. Everolimus may also stop the growth of new blood vessels that help tumors grow.    ,NCT01627067
Breast Cancer,Study of Survivorship Care Plans and Outcomes in Underserved Breast Cancer Survivors, Improvements in early detection and successful treatment of breast cancer have lead to a steady rise in the number of breast cancer (BC) survivors. With so many individuals living for extended periods after diagnosis the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends the implementation of treatment summaries and survivorship care plans (TSSPs) as a mechanism to improve ongoing clinical and coordination of care and to address the immediate post-treatment and long-term effects of cancer treatment including the ongoing psychosocial burden of a cancer diagnosis. The need for TSSPs has also been strongly advocated by the American Society of Clinical Oncology's Quality Oncology Practice Initiative and TSSPs have been included in the recently introduced Comprehensive Cancer Improvement Act (H.R. 1844). This will be one of the first randomized controlled trials to test the efficacy of TSSPs. The investigators will recruit 500 low income medically underserved women from two county public hospitals LAC+USC Medical Center and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center 10-24 months after breast cancer diagnosis for participation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the efficacy of TSSPs. The investigators will randomize these women into one of two groups: 1) a control condition of usual medical care and 2) an experimental condition of the control condition + a tailored TSSP + 1 face-to-face nurse counseling session with all cancer specialists and primary care physicians of record also receiving the TSSP and a cover letter suggesting how they can be clinically utilized. The investigators specific aims are to assess and compare between experimental and control groups the following primary outcomes at one year post-intervention: 1) discussion and implementation of recommended breast cancer survivorship care including surveillance and the evaluation and management of BC treatment-related symptoms 2) patient satisfaction with survivorship communication and care 3) pertinent aspects of health-related quality of life and further to then 4) assess the cost-consequences of the experimental intervention. This study will provide a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of TSSPs in a low-income underserved population of BC survivors known to be at high risk for poorer long-term outcomes including in mental health quality of life recurrence and mortality and will therefore allow us to demonstrate the greatest possible benefit of such an intervention.    ,NCT01627366

Breast Cancer,Diagnosis and Prediction of Taxanes Induced Cardiac Dysfunction, Breast cancer represents the most frequent form of neoplasia in women worldwide being responsible of 1.6% of annual deaths. Therefore it is a major public health issue and research in this field should be a priority. Taxanes such as paclitaxel and docetaxel are extremely powerful antineoplastic drugs which alone or in association to anthracyclines increase survival and lower the recurrence rate of cancer but their use is limited by cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity can appear early or late after therapy and may vary from subclinical myocardial dysfunction to irreversible heart failure. Currently cardiac dysfunction induced by taxanes is diagnosed through classical echocardiographic parameters. However these cannot detect subtle early changes of cardiac structure and function. Consequently description of new parameters which could detect cardiac dysfunction in an early stage becomes essential for detecting the group of patients at risk for irreversible heart failure. The objectives of the investigators project in patients with breast cancer treated with taxanes are to investigate their mechanisms which lead to cardiac dysfunction to describe new parameters for the early diagnosis of cardiotoxicity and to define predictive models for cardiotoxicity. Meanwhile project will publish the results in prestigious journals leading to an increase of the visibility of Romanian research internationally.    ,NCT01641562
Breast Cancer,Internal Mammary Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancer Patients With Clinically Axillary Node -Negative, In addition to the axillary lymph node the internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) chain is also the first-echelon nodal drainage site for metastasis and provides important prognostic information in breast cancer patients. The internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) provides a less invasive method of assessing the IMLN than surgical dissection. But the low visualization rate of IMSLN has been a restriction of IM-SLNB. This clinical trial is carried out to improve the visualization rate of IMSLN with modified techniques: (1) The radiotracer is injected intraparenchymally into 2~4 quadrants of breast. (2) The radiotracer is injected in a high volume. (3) The radiotracer should be injected under ultrasonographic guidance.    ,NCT01642511
Breast Cancer,Comparative Study on Two Post-operative Adjuvant Chemotherapy Regimens for Treating Triple-negative Breast Cancer, Recent clinical studies showed that triple-negative breast cancer patients (ER-/PR-/HER2-) may benefit more from Capecitabine chemotherapy. However the optimum post-operative adjuvant Capecitabine chemotherapy regimen has not been determined for Chinese population with triple-negative breast cancer. Thus it's necessary to conduct a multi-center Phase III clinical trial to verify efficacy and safety of Capecitabine in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. In this study a prospective randomized open multi-center Phase III clinical study was conducted to compare efficacy and safety of sequential Docetaxel followed by Fluorouracil/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide (FEC) and sequential Docetaxel and Capecitabine followed by Capecitabine/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide (XEC) as post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer in Chinese population.    ,NCT01642771

Breast Cancer,Anti-1-amino-3-[18F]Fluorocyclobutyl-1-carboxylic Acid (Anti-[18F](FACBC)Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT) of the Breast, Breast carcinoma is the most frequent cancer in women affecting an estimated 207090 in 2010 leading to 39840 cancer related deaths. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or PET-CT has become the a standard method for isolating the tumor. However FDG is insensitive in small breast tumors and certain histologic types such as lobular certain types of breast carcinoma. In addition FDG uptake can be nonspecific since inflammatory some benign lesions may also evidence have accumulation of this radiotracer. Hence there is a need for a tracer/imaging tool that increases the ability to characterize detect breast carcinoma and to detect locoregional spread as well as monitor therapeutic treatment response. anti-3-[18F]. anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutyl-1-carboxylic acid (FACBC) is an amino acid based PET radiotracer which has shown utility in detecting a variety of tumors. In cell culture experimentsFACBC has shown uptake in the breast tumor cell line. The primary aim of this study is to determine if FACBC PET-CT demonstrates uptake within breast carcinoma (primary site and/or locoregional lymph nodes) and to study uptake kinetics via time-activity curves from dynamic imaging characteristics. The investigators will enroll 12 patients who have a breast mass or masses and/or lymph nodes naïve to therapy about to undergo biopsy or post-biopsy pre-therapy. All patients will undergo standard of care imaging as appropriate such as mammography ultrasound MR and/or FDG PET-CT scanning. The investigators will then compare findings to determine if this radiotracer is worthy of further study in a more comprehensive experiment.    ,NCT01659645

Breast Cancer,Internal Mammary Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancer Patients With Clinically Axillary Node -Positive, In addition to the axillary lymph nodes the internal mammary lymph nodes (IMLNs) drainage is another important lymphatic channel of the breast. The status of IMLNs also provides important prognostic information for breast cancer patients. The technical evolvements of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and lymphoscintigraphy provided a less invasive method for assessing IMLNs than surgical dissection. Recently many study concerning IMSLNB was performed in the patients with clinically negative axillary nodes. However previous published studies concerning patients with breast cancer who all underwent a radical mastectomy have shown that IMLN metastases are mostly found concomitantly with axillary metastases. For this reason IM-SLNB is even more important for clinically axillary node-negative patients. To our knowledge this is the first attempt of the IM-SLNB in early breast cancer patients with clinically positive axillary nodes.    ,NCT01668914

Breast Cancer,The Effectiveness of Mindfulness on Chronic Pain in Breast Cancer Survivors, A recent epidemiologic survey has indicated that approx. 42% of Danish women treated for breast cancer experience negative sequelae in the form of pain following treatment. Chronic pain is known to be associated with impaired social and emotional functioning and thus presents a particular concern. Mindfulness-based intervention is among the complementary psychological treatments which cancer patients commonly seek out in relation to the course of their illness. Despite the popularity of mindfulness-based intervention among cancer patients no studies have so far investigated the effect of mindfulness-based intervention on chronic pain in breast cancer patients. While no studies so far have focused on pain there is evidence to suggest that mindfulness-based intervention is associated with improved psychosocial adaption to cancer. Furthermore non-cancer research suggests that mindfulness-based intervention is associated with reduced pain experiences. The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) on chronic pain in breast cancer patients. Women who have completed their treatment for breast cancer and who experience chronic pain will be randomized to an intervention group (MBCT) or a treatment-as-usual control group. All participants will be assessed at the same time points i.e. before the intervention (baseline) and three times after the intervention/control condition with the last follow-up 6 months after the intervention. In addition a number of potential moderators and mediators of the outcome will be explored. For example recent studies indicate that adult attachment style may constitute an important moderator and/or mediator in the development of pain and preliminary research has suggested that attachment style may moderate the effect of mindfulness-based intervention. The results will provide valuable new knowledge about the potential of MBCT as a treatment strategy for chronic pain in breast cancer patients will contribute to the clarification of underlying mechanisms in the experience of and coping with pain which could help the development of more effective individualized interventions.    ,NCT01674881

Breast Cancer,Imaging for Response Assessment of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Primary Breast Cancer (GALADON), The GALADON trial is a diagnostic and interventional study in which different molecular imaging methods as Positon Emission Tomography (PET) different kind of Magnetic Resonance Imaging - methods (MRI DWI and DCE-MRI) will be compared with common imaging methods (mammography ultrasound) to see if there can detect an early response to a combined neoadjuvant therapy with bevacizumab and docetaxel in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (this means patients were treated before the tumor was removed by surgery) with a drug like trastuzumab (monoclonal antibody) which is target to the Her2-protein is much more powerful than with chemotherapy alone because it is normalizing the blood supply and improves tumor delivery of conventional chemotherapy like docetaxel. The HER2 protein is only available in about 30 % of breast cancer types. bevacizumab is another humanized monoclonal antibody like trastuzumab but is effective not only in patients with an positive HER2 status and in combination with trastuzumab it may emphasize the effect in reduction of tumor growth. Bevacizumab is approved in advanced disease but no major neoadjuvant data available so far for primary breast cancer. As the therapy with monoclonal antibody regimes are expensive and may cause severe side effects predictive factors to select patients who will benefit from such highly specific drugs before therapy start would be medically and economically highly valuable. In this study the efficacy of combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy with bevacizumab trastuzumab and docetaxel in Arm A and bevacizumab and docetaxel in Arm B should be evaluated and the predictive impact of different imaging methods for tumor response should be shown.    ,NCT01690325

Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy and Sexual Functioning: The Effects of Vaginal Testosterone Therapy, It is well documented that women who have breast cancer may experience a decrease in quality of life and sexual functioning due to side effects from adjuvant endocrine therapy typically aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Women taking AIs are more likely to report unpleasant urogenital and vaginal symptoms due to the physiologic suppression of estradiol. This treatment can impair sexual functioning and cause a decreased sexual health quality of life. At the present time there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for the vulvovaginal or sexual side effects related to the use of AIs. The lack of treatment options is concerning because the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer continues to increase; their longevity also continues to increase with the use of newer adjuvant chemotherapies. Local health care practitioners have observed that the benefits of vaginal testosterone for sexual health in breast cancer survivors are similar to the benefits of vaginal estrogen in women without breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of using a daily compounded vaginal testosterone cream for 4 weeks (28 days) on breast cancer survivor's reported experience of vulvovaginal symptoms accompanying the use of AIs and their associated quality of life and sexual functioning.    ,NCT01697345

Breast Cancer,Study of the Effect of Eplerenone on Heart Function in Women Receiving Anthracycline Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer, Doxorubicin and other anthracyclines are commonly used to treat breast cancer and other types of cancer. Unfortunately they can cause heart muscle damage resulting in scarring abnormal contraction and relaxation and heart failure symptoms. This side effect occurs more frequently at higher doses and limits the total dose that can be given to cancer patients. Eplerenone is an oral medication that prevents or reverses heart damage in other disease states and is commonly used to treat heart failure. This study will investigate the use of eplerenone to protect the heart from these harmful side effects of doxorubicin. Few therapies have been shown to prevent heart damage in patients receiving anthracyclines. Small studies have suggested that other heart failure medications (ACE inhibitors beta-blockers) may reduce the incidence of cardiac toxicity but eplerenone and other drugs in its class (aldosterone antagonists) have not previously been studied. Eplerenone inhibits enzyme pathways that cause scarring of the heart and animal studies suggest that anthracyclines cause damage through these same pathways. This study aims to investigate whether eplerenone protects the heart from the harmful effects of doxorubicin chemotherapy. Specifically it will measure the effect that eplerenone has on heart muscle relaxation. It will randomly assign women undergoing chemotherapy with doxorubicin to one of two groups: one group will receive eplerenone and the other group will receive placebo (sugar) pills. The subjects will not know which type of pills they are taking. Heart muscle relaxation will be measured at baseline after completion of chemotherapy (8-12 weeks) and after 6 months. There will also be various blood tests measured in the study subjects to determine whether there might be certain blood tests that identify patients at particularly high risk of heart toxicity after doxorubicin therapy.    ,NCT01708798

Breast Cancer,Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) With Sorafenib for Breast Cancer Brain Metastases (BCBM)," Sorafenib is a new type of anti-cancer drug. It belongs to a new class of medications known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Sorafenib is thought to work against cancer in many ways. It helps decrease blood supply to the tumor. It also blocks some proteins that help the tumor cells to grow."" Sorafenib is approved by the Food and Drug administration (FDA) for treatment for other cancers like liver and kidney cancer. Sorafenib has also been studied in the treatment of breast cancer that has spread but is not specifically approved for the treatment of breast cancer. It has been studied both as a single agent and also in combination with other anti-cancer therapies for breast cancer. In laboratory models and in some patients with other cancers sorafenib has been studied in tumors in the brain. In this study sorafenib will be given together with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Overall this research study is designed to answer 2 main questions:   1. What dose of sorafenib should be used together with WBRT?   2. What are the side effects of sorafenib and WBRT when given together?    ",NCT01724606

Breast Cancer,Single Fraction Elderly Breast Irradiation (SiFEBI)," Irradiation and Accelerated Partial Breast (IPAS) to this day remains a therapeutic concept whose validity is being assessed on its non-inferiority in terms of local control compared to whole breast irradiation. At least eight phase III trials attempting to answer this question and thus provide a sufficient level of evidence to make this concept a new standard of care for sub-groups of patients well defined (1). However without waiting for the final results of these randomized trials (which will not be fully valid with a drop of at least ten years) the American societies (ASTRO) and European (ESTRO) radiotherapy have all two proposed classification (very similar) into 3 groups according to the risk to the patient in terms of local recurrence after IPAS. And are defined by the ESTRO:   -  The low-risk group (""suitable"" for ASTRO)   -  The intermediate-risk group (""cautionary"" in ASTRO)   -  The high-risk group (""not suitable"" for ASTRO) (2.3). Therefore it is possible to propose to a patient a randomized clinical tria IPAS to subject it belongs to the group ""low risk."" The results of phase II trials as a long-term analysis of the matched team of William Beaumont Hospital (4) and the phase III trial using intra-operative radiation photons in low energy X whose results were recently published (5) confirm the value of this new therapeutic concept for post-operative breast cancer at low risk of local recurrence. In France the therapists were quickly directed to a sub-population for which the IPAS could represent a real improvement in the therapeutic management in significantly reducing the number of irradiation sessions of thirty in 6 weeks 5 days at 10 in a single view (6). Several French phase II trials were started specifically targeting the female population aged using a balloon catheter (MammoSite ®) (7) or by intra-operative radiation électronthérapie (8). The results of the test using the GERICO-03 brachytherapy with high dose rate (promoter: FNCLCC National Federation of Anti Cancer Centres  recently merged into Group Health Cooperation entitled UNICANCER) are currently submitted to Journal Green Radiotherapy (Radiotherapy and Oncology from 09/11/11) (9). On a technical level two main approaches are used (10):   -  Irradiation intraoperative electron or low-energy photons   -  Radiation after surgery The advantage of intraoperative irradiation is the optimal reduction of total processing time radio-surgery because the patient is irradiated during the lumpectomy. However 15-20% of these patients receive partial breast irradiation as histo-prognostic criteria provided in the histologically final report confirm the non-adapted indication of IPAS (5). In contrast the post-operative IPAS can treat only patients meeting all criteria for IPAS but treatment-related travel are about 5 treatments for bi-fractionated (2 sessions per days separated by at least 6 hours).

Breast Cancer,An Internet-based Weight Loss and Exercise Intervention for Breast Cancer Survivors," The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a behavioral weight loss and exercise intervention delivered via the internet at different cancer centers in New England. The investigators hypothesize that participants will lose 7% of their body weight. The research is being done because many women who are treated for breast cancer are overweight and treatment for breast cancer is often accompanied by weight gain. Individuals who are overweight may be more likely to have their breast cancer come back. Also women who exercise at least three hours a week seem to have less chance of their cancer coming back. The investigators hope to identify an effective weight loss and exercise intervention for breast cancer survivors that can be easily accessed by many people. This study is designed to determine the feasibility of conducting a distantly delivered-weight loss and exercise intervention for patients who have been treated for breast cancer at three cancer centers and to evaluate the efficacy of an Internet-based behavioral weight loss and exercise intervention delivered to overweight/obese breast cancer survivors in three New England locations. Participants will be recruited from three New England Cancer Centers - the Vermont Cancer Center Norris Cotton Cancer Center at Dartmouth University and the University of Massachusetts Cancer Center. Participants from each center will undergo baseline assessments that include diet assessment body measurements (height weight etc) a physical activity assessment and be asked to complete a series of questionnaires. Patients that meet the minimum requirements will be enrolled on the study. They will participate in weekly on-line ""chats"" about behavioral and diet modifications led by a qualified facilitator. Participants will also engage in increasing amounts of aerobic activity (typically walking) throughout the course of the intervention. The intervention lasts 6 months. At the end of those 6 months participants will have the same assessments that were collected at baseline. Following the collection of those assessments participants will have completed the study.

Breast Cancer,The Safety and Effects of Gefitinib in Triple-negativeEGFR Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and can be classified into several distinctive subgroups. Triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) is defined by lack of estrogen(ER) progesterone(PR) immunoreactivity and lack of human epidermal receptor-2(HER2) overexpression. TNBC comprises around 15% of all breast cancer and is characterized by its aggressive clinical behavior and insensitivity toward available targeted treatment strategies such as endocrine and anti-HER2 therapies.Although TNBC is sensitive to chemotherapyearly relapse with metastatic disease is common and the prognosis is poor. Development Of novel treatment strategies isthereforeneeded and the study of other potential targets in TNBClike tyrosine kinase receptorsis a topic of interest. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor(EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that encoded by cell erythroblastosis virus oncogene B1(C-erbB1) and belongs to the HER/Erythroblastosis virus oncogene B(ErbB) family. By several signal pathwaysEGFR regulates cell proliferation differentiation apoptosis invasionand angiogenesisand serves as a poor prognostic factor.EGFR is overexpressed in a variety of malignancies including TNBC.Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemical studies have indicated that 40 to 60% of TNBCs exhibit EGFR expression and gene amplification was found in 18% of this subgroupbut EGFR mutation was rare in TNBC. By farthe role of gefitinib an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI)in the metastatic TNBC has not been identified. Most clinical trials about EGFR TKIs in the breast cancer have one or more limitations including:1) the study population had received heavily pretreatment; 2)the enrolled patients included several subgroups of breast cancer; 3)the expression of EGFR was not clear in the enrolled patients. Here the investigators launch a prospective clinical trial and about 50 patients with triple-negativeEGFR positive metastatic breast cancer that have received at least second line therapy will be enrolled. these patients will be treated with gefitinib the toxicity and effects of gefitinib will be recorded prospectively to evaluate the role of gefitinib in the metastatic TNBC.    ,NCT01732276

Breast Cancer,Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Risk in African American Women, Background: - At present women do not have very accurate tests to inform of them of their personal risk of developing breast cancer. More information on the changes associated with both benign and cancerous breast lesions will help develop better risk information. Researchers have been looking at cells found in breast milk to study genetic changes related to breast cancer. However most of these cell samples have been collected from white women. A new study wants to collect breast milk samples from African American women for further research. Comparing the results of genetic tests will help improve understanding of breast cancer risk in all women. Objectives: - To study genetic changes related to breast lesions including breast cancer in African American women. Eligibility: - African American women at least 18 years of age who are nursing a baby and who either have had or are being considered for a breast biopsy. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with personal health questions.   -  Participants will receive a box with sterile bottles for milk collection. They will collect two breast milk samples one from each breast. They will also fill out a questionnaire about their medical history.   -  The box with the samples and the questionnaire will be returned to the clinical center for study.   -  After the box is returned participants will be asked to provide a copy of the biopsy report for any breast biopsies they have had.   -  There will be a followup phone call every year. Participants will provide health history information. This information will include whether they have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous year.    ,NCT01736306

Breast Cancer,A Study to Correlate Ultrasound Elastography With Histopathology to Monitor the Response of Locally Advanced Breast Cancer to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, This research proposal concerns a study to monitor the effects of chemotherapy on breast cancer tumour and peritumour stromal cells using ultrasound (US) elastography (also known as strain imaging). Many cancer treatments currently being developed are targeted; that is they exploit particular biological processes in specific cancer cell types to disrupt tumour growth. Being able to monitor the efficacy of these typically high-cost drug therapies is essential both for the best patient outcome as well as offering economical benefits to the health care system and much needed insight into future drug development. Ultrasound provides a relatively inexpensive non-invasive means for imaging cancers and has been used widely in breast cancer diagnosis for many years. Its role in therapy monitoring has been suggested but has not been well explored. The purpose of this proposal is to explore this potential in more depth. It has been identified that significant interaction takes place between tumour and stroma through all stages of tumour growth; this complex relationship is an ongoing topic of research. Fibrotic changes occur during tumour growth and are also a quintessential process of healing. Indeed fibrosis is a common after effect to chemotherapy in many forms of cancer. Elastography is an established imaging technique (based on ultrasound or MRI) which can estimate the relative stiffness of tissues in vivo and is thus well-suited to monitor these particular biological processes. This elucidates the main hypothesis of this project: fibrosis cancer cell necrosis and inflammation may all contribute to a measurable response in elastography. These changes to the tissue composition can be imaged over a course of a patient's treatment to assess the response to chemo/hormonal therapy. The ultimate project goals are to develop a clinical tool (based on ultrasound elastography) to improve treatment management in addition to offering a better biological understanding of tumour/stroma behaviour.    ,NCT01737970

Breast Cancer,Vitamin D and Mammographic Breast Density, There is some evidence that vitamin D could be used to reduce breast cancer risk. Randomized controlled trials would provide definitive evidence about this effect. However trials with breast cancer as outcome are expensive and time-consuming. Use of surrogate outcomes has been advocated to accelerate progress in the identification of interventions that could prevent breast cancer. Mammographic breast density is one of the strongest breast cancer risk indicators and is already used as a surrogate outcome in several breast cancer prevention trials. The aim of this double-blind randomized controlled trial is to determine whether daily oral supplementation with vitamin D3 (1000 2000 or 3000 IU) over a period of 1 year reduces breast density in premenopausal women compared to placebo. A total of 376 women (94 per arm) who live in Quebec City will be recruited. Showing that vitamin D reduces breast density would provide strong support for the idea that vitamin D can be a safe and inexpensive approach for the prevention of breast cancer.    ,NCT01747720

Breast Cancer,Evolution Natriuretic Peptide Concentrations of B-type (BNP) During General Anesthesia Under Propofol and Sevoflurane Association in Patients Previously Sensitized to Anthracyclines, The cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines chemotherapy remains a major problem despite clinical and echocardiographic monitoring. In the case of treatment for breast cancer surgery requiring general anesthesia may follow chemotherapy. Although a possible interaction between general anesthetics and anthracyclines on systolic function is only rarely mentioned some cases of heart failure and / or conduction disturbances peranesthésique were observed in patients treated or previously treated with anthracyclines. The determination of concentration of BNP is a diagnostic tool used in the detection of heart failure and acute coronary syndromes. The question of a possible synergism between cardiotoxic anthracyclines and anesthetic agents arises. Given its minimally invasive nature and its diagnostic value the BNP assay might thus allow to highlight a possible subclinical deficiency. To our knowledge there is very little data regarding a possible synergism between cardiotoxic anthracyclines and anesthetic agents.    ,NCT01754597

Breast Cancer,Neurotoxicity Characterization Study of Nab-paclitaxel Versus Conventional Paclitaxel in Metastatic Breast Cancer, Nanomedicines are currently being developed in the treatment of cancer due to their pharmacological advantages over traditional formulations; they provide a shorter infusion time and lower risks of hypersensitivity reactions associated with commonly used solvents. Nab-paclitaxel is a nanoparticle albumin-bound particle form of paclitaxel that is thought to exploit natural albumin pathways to enhance the selective uptake and accumulation of paclitaxel at the site of the tumour thus reducing its diffusion to normal tissues. Nab-paclitaxel has been approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated. SPARC is a cysteine rich acid protein that is overexpressed in a broad proportion of solid tumours. Expression of this protein could sensitize tumour cells to antitumor activity of Nab-paclitaxel due to its union through albumin-binding to this protein. First-line clinical trials have been developed with different Nab-paclitaxel regimens and also in combination with different chemotherapies and trastuzumab showing a high level of efficacy. Toxicity profile of Nab-paclitaxel is well characterized with significantly less haematological toxicities compared with conventional paclitaxel. Nab-paclitaxel derived grade III neuropathy is short-lasting and more reversible than conventional paclitaxel-derived neuropathy probably due to absence of Cremophor solvent or due to paclitaxel itself. However there is still a lack of clinical and physiological characterisation of Nab-paclitaxel induced neuropathy. The current used tools for early detection and continuous evaluation of neurotoxicity are not optimal. Most used toxicity scales are limited as they do not provide a detailed information of the severity of the neuropathy its impact on quality of life or physiopathology mechanisms. In addition an inter-individual variability exists in terms of neurotoxicity predisposition when taxanes are used; it could be related to polymorphic differences in genes implicated in transport and metabolism of these drugs.    ,NCT01763710

Breast Cancer,Intra-operative Digital vs. Standard Mammography, A breast biopsy in the operating room may be needed in up to 15% of patients with an abnormality on mammogram. When an abnormality is present but there is no palpable mass the abnormality must be localized with a wire before going to the operating room. This technique is also used when a breast cancer is present but there is no mass in order to perform a targeted lumpectomy. Once the abnormality is surgically removed the specimen with the wire is taken to the breast imaging department for a specimen x-ray to ensure that the targeted abnormality is present within the specimen. If the abnormality is close to the edge of the specimen additional tissue is often removed. A newer method for evaluating the specimen is to perform imaging in the operating room. Portable digital mammography units are available for this purpose. The Biovision digital specimen mammography system is FDA-approved and currently in use in over 200 centers in the United States. Several studies have shown that intra-operative digital mammography is as accurate as standard specimen mammography and takes less time to perform. It may also decrease the chance of having to go back to the operating room to take more breast tissue after lumpectomy because of cancer cells near teh margin(s) of the specimen on final pathology. Having to go back to the operating room to take more tissue is called a re-excision. The purpose of this study is to compare standard specimen mammography to intra-operative specimen mammography to quantify potential operating room time savings and to determine if the use of intra-operative specimen mammography decreases re-excision rates. We aim to see if intra-operative specimen mammography is more efficient and if it decreases re-excision rates.    ,NCT01766102

Breast Cancer,Kinetics of Troponin and BNP in Breast Cancer Chemotherapy With Adriamycin and Trastuzumab, This pilot study involves very frequent monitoring of breast cancer patient blood levels of hs-cTnT Troponin and n-t-BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide) before and after initiation of chemotherapy with either adriamycin or trastuzumab in order to define the kinetics of both biomarkers during the first two cycles of chemotherapy. Cardiac troponins and BNP are frequently elevated after experimental chemotherapy in animal models. Their behavior in humans has been inconsistent with occasional elevations seen usually within 30 days of therapy. Assays for troponin with sensitivity into the pg/ml range have now been introduced. A majority of patients greater than age 50 have elevations above the detection limit compared to only 1-3% with conventional troponin assays and over 90% of diabetics have elevations above the detection limit. Moreover augmented release of high sensitivity troponin is detected after exercise or rapid atrial pacing of durations of 10-15 minutes in patients with and without coronary artery disease. This improved sensitivity suggests the potential for detection and monitoring of cardiac damage after cancer chemotherapy. We hypothesized that this new generation of troponin assay would be associated with kinetic behavior suggesting ongoing cardiac damage with anthracycline therapy and possibly also with trastuzumab.    ,NCT01771549

Breast Cancer,BKM120 For Triple Negative Breast Cancer," This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use the side effects it may cause and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved BKM120 for use in patients including people with your type of cancer. BKM120 is a drug that works by blocking a protein called PI3K which may contribute to cancer growth. This drug has been used in experiments in the laboratory and information from these research studies suggests that BKM120 may help to prevent cancer cells from growing. In this research study the investigators are looking to see if BKM120 works to stop breast cancer cells from growing.    ",NCT01790932

AZD4547 is a drug which specifically ""blocks"" proteins called fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1) that are involved in the processes that help cancer cells to grow. These proteins may also be responsible for the development of resistance to hormonal therapies used to treat some breast cancers. AZD4547 is not yet approved for use in breast cancer and is therefore being used in this study as a research drug. The investigators will also test the theory that it is not necessary for high levels of FGFR1 to be present in the body to see benefit from AZD4547. (Stage 1 only)    ",NCT01791985

Breast Cancer,A Phase I Dose Escalation Study of Eribulin Plus Weekly Carboplatin for Metastatic Breast Patients, This study is being done to see how safe the combination of eribulin and carboplatin is and if it will work to help people with advanced breast cancer. Eribulin and carboplatin are both chemotherapy drugs. They work by killing cancer cells. A person is made up of cells which control every function in the body. Some cells stop working like they should and become cancer cells. These cancer cells grow and multiply rapidly and can cause destruction to normal body organs. Eribulin and carboplatin have both been approved by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of breast cancer. The combination of these two drugs and the safest dose of eribulin to use is experimental.    ,NCT01795586
Breast Cancer,Adapted Physical Activity Effect on Aerobic Function and Fatigue at Home in Patients With Breast Cancer Treated in Adjuvant or Neoadjuvant Phase, Physical exercise has been identified as a major item of many chronic diseases and cancer rehabilitation. It contributes to an improvement in the quality of life and to a decrease in the current treatment side effects and mortality. Cancer in association with treatment toxicity and an inactive lifestyle lead to a fall in physical capability and causes problems in daily activities. The physical capacity and the tolerance for exercise fall simultaneously leading to a deconditioning vicious circle which increases physical psychological and emotional symptoms of fatigue. Therefore physical activity for health is a valid and relevant way to improve quality of life and to manage cancer patient fatigue. The aim of the study is the assessment of the effects of a physical activity retraining program on aerobic capacity strength and fatigue in a breast cancer population treated by adjuvant or néoadjuvant chemotherapy.    ,NCT01795612
Breast Cancer,Paclitaxel + Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab as Pre-Op for Inflammatory BrCa," This research study is a Phase II clinical trial which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. In this study paclitaxel and trastuzumab are being combined with pertuzumab which is ""investigational"" for the preoperative treatment of inflammatory breast cancer. Trastuzumab is given for a total of 12 months for the treatment of HER2 positive breast cancer. This study also adds pertuzumab to trastuzumab so that both drugs are given for a total of 12 months; this combination is also ""investigational"". ""Investigational"" means that pertuzumab is being studied. It also means that although the FDA has approved pertuzumab for preoperative use to treat breast cancer it has not been thoroughly studied in combination with paclitaxel and trastuzumab for preoperative treatment of inflammatory breast cancer. It has been FDA approved for specific use in advanced breast cancer that is HER2 positive. Pertuzumab is an antibody which is a protein that attacks a foreign substance is the body. Pertuzumab blocks the function of the HER2 protein like trastuzumab does. However pertuzumab binds to a different part of the HER2 receptor and stops cancer cells from growing. This drug has been used in the treatment of advanced breast cancer that is HER2 positive and has been combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in those studies. Information from those other research studies suggests that pertuzumab may help to kill the cancer cells in the breast and enable you to undergo a mastectomy. The addition of pertuzumab may also help reduce the chance of cancer recurrence. In this research study we are combining pertuzumab with paclitaxel and trastuzumab as preoperative therapy and will determine the response of the cancer remaining in the breast at the time of mastectomy. In addition we are combining trastuzumab with pertuzumab for a total of 12 months and we are looking to see whether the combination reduces the chance that the cancer will return. Another goal of this research study is to determine whether we can develop a way to identify tumors that will respond well to this study treatment. We will do research tests on your tumor tissue before during and after study treatment. These tests may help doctors understand how the study treatment may work to treat your type of breast cancer. In the future these tests may help us find ways to help match patients with the drugs most likely to work against their specific tumors before treatment begins.    ",NCT01796197
Breast Cancer,Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Versus no Dissection in Breast Cancer With Positive Sentinel Lymph Node, The recently randomized trial (ASCOG Z0011) support that among patients with limited sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastatic breast cancer treated with breast conservation and systemic therapy the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone compared with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) did not result in inferior survival. These patients therefore are unlikely to benefit from further surgery that results in a longer period of hospitalization higher costs and higher postoperative morbidity. This result has been written in the 2012 National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines. However Limitations of Z0011 such as failure to achieve target accrual and possible randomization imbalance favoring the SLNB-alone group must be considered. In the other hand further testing in different country are needed. The investigators design and begin a prospective randomized multicenter phase III study of ALND vs. no ALND in breast Cancer with positive SLN--the validation of Z0011 in China.    ,NCT01796444

Breast Cancer,Impact of a Group Intervention on Breast Cancer Patient's Adjustment and Emotion Regulation at the End of Treatment, Background: The end of treatment is for cancer patients the beginning of a critical rehabilitation period including numerous physical emotional professional and cognitive challenges. Specific interventions adapted to this post-treatment period need thus to be designed. Interventions such as group cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis have been shown to be effective. However moderate effect sizes no comprehensive description of the treatment interventions and assessments relying only on self-report measures warrant further investigation. This study aims to assess in breast cancer patients at the end of treatment the impact of a group intervention combining cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis versus a group intervention on patient's adjustment and emotion self-regulation. Design: This is a two-armed longitudinal randomized controlled trial. Breast cancer patients finishing their radiation therapy treatment will be randomized to either an immediate group intervention combining cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis or a group intervention. Patients will be assessed at three time points during the first year following the end of treatment: at 1 (T1) 6 (T2) and 12 (T3) months after the end of treatment. Patients' adjustment will be assessed through questionnaires. Patient emotion self-regulation ability will be assessed through their ability to respond both subjectively (self-reported emotional state) and objectively (heart rate) to two emotion self-regulation tasks. Discussion: It is hypothesized that a group intervention combining cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis will be more effective than a group intervention. Results of this study will contribute to improving post-treatment care for breast cancer patients.    ,NCT01797354

Breast Cancer,Telehealth System to Improve Quality of Life in Breast Cancer Survivors, Background: Cancer is increasingly viewed as a chronic disease and therefore there is a growing need for long-term treatments. Breast cancer survivors suffer physical impairment after oncology treatment. This impairment reduces quality of life (QoL) and increases the prevalence of conditions associated to unhealthy life-style. Objective: The overall objective of e-Cuidate telerehabilitation will be to evaluate short and long-term effects telehealth program. Methods: Seventy-two breast cancer survivors (age range: 18-65 years) will be recruited through oncology and breast units at the Virgen de las Nieves Hospital and San Cecilio Hospital and associations of breast cancer patients in Granada. Patients will be randomized to receive the online rehabilitation group (n=36) or usual care (control) group (n=36).

Patients will have a set of treatments with a pulsed dye laser. This is a laser that targets red blood vessels and delivers heat causing the telangiectasias to become smaller and less visible. The laser has been used safely to treat telangiectasias on the skin of patients who received radiation for breast cancer. Patients in the study will be asked to complete a questionnaire asking how they feel about the telangiectasias their radiated skin and its effect on their daily lives. The questionnaire will be given at every visit. The improvement in the look of patients' radiated skin will also be compared to answers to the questionnaire. We hope the study will improve our understanding of how patients feel about the long term effects of radiation on their skin.    ,NCT01803516
Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer With Low Risk Of Local Recurrence: Partial and Accelerated Radiation With Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT) Vs. Standard Radiotherapy After Conserving Surgery (Phase III Study, This study was designed and developed in the Emilia Romania research and innovation program (PRI ER). The study does not have commercial sponsors and comes under the independent studies provided for by Ministerial Decree 17.12.2005. The PRI ER program will guarantee a contribution to the study for the first three years of recruitment through the regional Innovation Fund to cover the costs of coordination and data management sustained by the Coordinating Center. Primary Objectives The study proposes to evaluate whether partial hypofractionated and accelerated irradiation of the sole surgical cavity in patients suffering from breast cancer with low risk of local recurrence and who undergo conservative surgery is not inferior to postoperative irradiation with conventional fractionation of the entire breast as regards local control (incidence of ipsilateral recurrences as prime event). Secondary Objectives Comparison of the global survivals freedom from locoregional recurrences (with exception for contralateral tumors and second tumors) distant relapse-free (except for local or regional relapses or in the contralateral breast) in patients treated with conventional radiotherapy and accelerated partial radiation. To evaluate whether accelerated partial irradiation offers cosmetic results acute toxicity comparable with conventional irradiation. Possible connection with other national and international studies Similar studies which nonetheless evaluate different methods of partial irradiation are currently underway. Study Design Multicenter phase III controlled randomized unblinded study of non-inferiority. Number of cases Recruitment of 3302 patients is planned. Target Population of the Study Women aged = > 49 ECOG 0-2 undergoing conservative breast surgery for invasive breast cancer pT 1-2 (< 3 cm in diameter) pN0-N1 M0 unifocal resection margins histologically negative (³ 2 mm) at first intervention or after subsequent widening. Duration of the recruitment and of the subsequent follow-up A recruitment of 8 years is planned and a follow-up period of 5 years for an overall duration of the study of 13 years. Treatment The patients will be randomized to receive one of the following treatments: Trial arm 38.5 Gy total in 10 fractions (3.85 Gy per fraction) twice a day with an interval of at least 6 hours between the two fractions for five consecutive working days. Control arm 50.0 Gy in 25 fractions (2 Gy per fraction) once a day for 5 days in the week. Endpoints Primary: survival free of local ipsilateral recurrence as prime event Secondary: global survival locoregional recurrence-free distant recurrence-free acute and late toxicity (RTOG) and cosmetic result. Evaluation and Follow-Up Program Controls are planned during the radiotherapy at the end of treatment at 6 weeks 3-6-12 months from the end of the radiotherapy and then once a year until the end of 5 years. Data Analysis Partial irradiation will be considered not inferior to the standard irradiation if the top extreme of the HR confidence interval at 95% (to endpoint) does not exceed the established value of 1.5 The study was sized in relation to the rate of local ipsilateral breast recurrences as prime event at 5 years and assuming that this rate in the standard treatment group is 4% accepting as maximum Hazard Ratio inferior to 1.5 and error a and b equal respectively to 0.05 and 0.10 and test at an endpoint. The survivals will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratio (HR) will be calculated using the Cox model and its confidence interval at 95% will be reported.

Breast Cancer,Functional Anatomical Examination of Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Drainage in the Axillary Subregions in Early Breast Cancer, Regional lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival in breast cancer. Accurate nodal staging can be achieved only by surgery. Today in early-stage invasive breast cancers with clinically negative lymph nodes minimally invasive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is considered the gold standard of regional lymph node staging. To optimize the effectiveness of SLNB precise pre-and intraoperative mapping of lymphatic drainage is important. The (SLNB) technique is not standardized. The most common and most accurate way of lymphatic mapping is performed with the combined application of a gamma-emitting isotope labeled substance and blue dye the so-called double labeling technique. Functional lymphatic drainage of SLNB double staining in the mammary gland skin and axilla present a number of uncertainties. According to the axillary lateral thoracic and thoracodorsal veins Ibusuki et al. divided the axillary region into four subregions: brachial (lateral) pectoral (anterior) central and subscapular (posterior) zones. They revealed clear relationship between the anatomic location and status of the SLN also confirmed by Gallowitsch et al. SLN was detected in Level I in 96% and in Level II in 4% by SPECT/CT. Knowedge of relationships between the drainage of sentinel lymph node staining into the axillary subregions location of the primary tumor tumor size SLN positivity and its location within the subregion are of particular importance in the decision making whether or not axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND) needs to be performed. In the prospective randomized phase 3 trial by Giuliano et al. (ACOSOG Z-11) ALND was not performed in early breast cancer patients with clinically negative axilla and breast-conserving surgery for 1-2 macroscopically positive SLNs (10). After an average follow-up of 6.3 years data were compared to the traditional ALND group and no difference was detected in 5-year overall survival or disease-free survival at 5 years. Aims of the investigation: To examine the location of SLN in the axillary subregion (anterior posterior central lateral apical) in patients with early breast cancer (T <5 cm). To statistically assess correlations between the location size histological parameters of primary breast tumor and the subregion of the SLN. To statistically assess SLN positivity and its location within the sbregion. To statistically assess subregional localisation of positive SLN and the number of all positive regional lymph nodes to predict a limited number of cases with lymph node metastasis based on the test results of the ACOSOG Z-11 trial by which ALND could be omitted.    ,NCT01804309
Breast Cancer,Melatonin Versus Placebo in Breast Cancer, The purpose of this research study is to determine whether melatonin taken every night can affect blood levels of estrogen or IGF (insulin-growth factor levels).

Breast Cancer,Placebo-controlled Trial With Vitamin D to Prevent Worsening/Relieve Aromatase Inhibitor-induced Musculoskeletal Symptoms in Breast Cancer Patients, The third generation oral aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are increasingly being used in the management of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. One of the issues related with administration of oral AIs is their side effects particularly on the musculoskeletal system. Although the prevalence and importance of arthralgia and myalgia occurring in BC patients receiving adjuvant AIs are evident the mechanisms clearly explaining these invalidating symptoms are unknown. In this project we aim to unravel the interaction between vitamin D and musculoskeletal adverse events experienced by AI users. We will also evaluate how vitamin D supplementation affects AI-induced musculoskeletal symptoms in breast cancer patients by means of a randomized placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial. We will assess changes in the musculoskeletal system by using magnetic resonance imaging of joints hand grip strength and also monitor serum IGF-I and estrogen levels together with bone resorption and formation markers.    ,NCT01809171

Breast Cancer,Pilot Study to Evaluate the Effect of Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy on Pain Threshold in Breast Cancer Patients, Postmenopausal women who have hormone receptor positive breast cancer are typically treated with aromatase inhibitor medications which substantially decrease the amount of estrogen produced by their bodies. These medications are fairly well tolerated but can cause aches and pains which can be quite severe in some cases. People experience pain differently. Estrogen appears to play a role in how we experience pain. Therefore decreasing estrogen levels may lead to more pain in some women than others. The goal of this study is to evaluate perception of pain in women with breast cancer and to determine if differences in pain perception lead to more aches and pains in some women treated with aromatase inhibitors. In this study we plan to enroll 55 women with breast cancer who are starting treatment with an aromatase inhibitor. Participants will undergo testing to evaluate their perception of pain and will also complete a set of questionnaires. Testing will be conducted before starting aromatase inhibitor therapy as well as after 3 and 6 months of therapy. We will investigate whether pre-existing differences in pain perception lead to different amounts of pain during aromatase inhibitor therapy.    ,NCT01814397

Breast Cancer,Omega-3 Fatty Acid in Treating Pain in Patients With Breast or Ovarian Cancer Receiving Paclitaxel, Paclitaxel a widely used chemotherapeutic agent is associated with several well-known side effects including neuropathy (weakness numbness and pain) and generalized body aches. The latter has recently been described as paclitaxel-associated acute pain syndrome (P-APS) and often occurs in the first three to four days after administration. It affects about 58-90% of patients. Currently the mechanism of P-APS is unknown and there is no standard of care to treat it. However an intervention with both anti-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective properties would be an ideal candidate for testing in the prevention of P-APS and subsequent development of peripheral neuropathy. Previous studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may act as neuroprotective agents and there are no currently documented safety concerns with their combined use with paclitaxel. Therefore this randomized pilot clinical trial will determine whether omega-3 fatty acids can treat pain in patients with breast or ovarian cancer receiving paclitaxel.    ,NCT01821833

Breast Cancer,Eribulin in HER2 Negative Metastatic BrCa, This research study is a phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of a drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. Eribulin is a chemotherapy approved by the US FDA in November of 2010 to treat patients with metastatic breast cancer who have received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. It works by interfering with cancer cell division growth and spread. In this research study the investigators are looking to see how well Eribulin helps participants with metastatic breast cancer as a first-line or second-line chemotherapy treatment. The investigators also would like to learn about the side-effects that participants experience with this medication in particular neuropathy. Neuropathy is a condition in which the nerves are affected leading to numbness or tingling of the fingers and toes. The investigators would like to study the effect Eribulin has on the nerves through regular questionnaires that ask about any nerve-related symptoms.

Breast Cancer,ALA-induced Fluorescence Imaging of Breast Cancers Using the Handheld PRODIGI Imaging Device, Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in women. Currently breast conservation surgery (BCS) is the treatment most often prescribed. BCS involves removing the tumor while conserving the greatest amount of healthy breast tissue. Under standard white light tumor borders are difficult for the surgeons to visualize. Therefore between 30-70% of patients require a second operation to remove remaining cancerous tissue that wasn't detected during the initial surgery. Thus there is an urgent clinical need for a new imaging tool that improves tumor visualization during the first surgery. PRODIGI a new hand-held optical imaging device uses a safe violet-blue light to detect fluorescence signals in the tissue. Different tissues are associated with specific fluorescent colors and therefore the device can be used to differentiate between tumor and healthy breast tissue. Based on previous clinical data PRODIGI can distinguish some tumors from normal tissues but is not specific enough to detect a difference across all breast tumor types. The fluorescent contrast drug 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) accumulates in tumors naturally and previous research has shown that 5-ALA increases tumor-normal tissue fluorescence contrast. In this observational clinical study PRODIGI and 5-ALA will be used to visualize tumor borders during BCS. 5-ALA induced fluorescent images from the surgical sample and the surgical bed obtained by PRODIGI will be compared retrospectively with the images taken under standard white light and/or autofluorescence. The technology's ability to accurately identify tumor borders better than conventional practice will be confirmed by tissue pathology.    ,NCT01837225

Breast Cancer,T-DM1 vs Paclitaxel/Trastuzumab for Breast (ATEMPT Trial)," This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use the side effects it may cause and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means that the FDA has not approved this drug for use patients undergoing adjuvant treatment for HER2+ breast cancer. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. This drug has been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent the recurrence of breast cancer in this research study. The use of T-DM1 in this research study is experimental which means it is not approved by any regulatory authority for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. However it FDA-approved for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. T-DM1 has caused cancer cells to die in laboratory studies. In preclinical studies this drug has prevented or slowed the growth of breast cancer. The breast cancer treatments (paclitaxel and Trastuzumab) used in this study are considered part of standard-of-care regimens in early breast cancer. A standard treatment means that this is a treatment that would be accepted by the majority of the medical community as a suitable treatment for your type of breast cancer. In this research study the investigators are looking to see if the study drug T-DM1 will have less side effects than traditional HER2-positive breast cancer treatment of trastuzumab and paclitaxel. The investigators are also hoping to learn about the long term benefits and disease-free survival of participants who take the study drug T-DM1 in comparison to those participants to take the combination of trastuzumab and paclitaxel.

Breast Cancer,A Study of Palbociclib in Addition to Standard Endocrine Treatment in Hormone Receptor Positive Her2 Normal Patients With Residual Disease After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Surgery, The PENELOPEB study is designed to demonstrate that in the background of standard anti-hormonal therapy palbociclib provides superior invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) compared to placebo in pre- and postmenopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-normal early breast cancer at high risk of relapse after showing less than pathological complete response to neoadjuvant taxane- containing chemotherapy. Considering the high risk of recurrence in patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a high CPS-EG score palbociclib appears to be an attractive option with a favourable safety profile for these patients.    ,NCT01864746
Breast Cancer,Study of Circulating and Tumor Biomarkers in Breast Cancer Patients, Aims: To evaluate the role of monoclonal antibodies in the detection of cancer specific antigens in blood and tumor tissue and the potential use of these antibodies for future evaluation for therapy. Also to evaluate the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and to study EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal) signature changes during chemotherapy. Methods: To take 20mls of blood from advanced breast cancer patients before a new course of anti-cancer therapy and another 20mls of blood 3 weeks after treatment. In addition Consent will be obtained to cut 10-15 tissue sections from their archival tumor specimens. Whenever possible the blood taking will be timed such that no additional needle prick will be done specifically for the purpose of the study by coinciding it with standard blood taking which is required for the patient's treatment. Importance of proposed research to science or medicine:Detection of tumor specific antigens in the blood may potentially reduce the need for more invasive biopsies for confirmation of diagnosis of cancer or follow-up of cancer in the future. The identification and development of antibodies specific to these tumor antigens or markers may offer future therapeutic options or as a vehicle to deliver cytotoxic therapy. Identification of CTCs as well as understanding the changes that occur in EMT signature in these circulating tumor cells may serve as a means of potential means of prognostication and modification of therapy in the future. Potential Benefits and Risks: Potential risks to the patient include that of blood taking (pain feeling faint infection). Patients will not benefit directly from the study but the knowledge gained may help the management of future patients. Cancer biomarkers such as antigens and circulating tumor cells may be a potential area to developing new methods of diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Monoclonal antibiotics are now able to be identified and isolated that may specifically target progenitors of breast cancer as well as CTCs. The changes that occur to CTCs during treatment may serve as a means of prognostication as well as allow for therapeutic modifications. Clinical correlative studies into these areas (MAbs and CTCs) will serve to determine the role of these in clinical application in the future.    ,NCT01866202

Breast Cancer,Fat Metabolism Following Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer, Following chemotherapy breast cancer patients primarily gain fat mass and lose muscle mass. Both depletion of muscle and an increase of fat mass in breast cancer patients are related to short survival and decreased skeletal muscle mass and function may result in fatigue and inactivity which contributes to fat mass changes and can be responsible for chemo-toxicity and increased mortality. The purpose of this study is to provide detailed insight in chemotherapy related changes in lipid metabolism and gut digestion and absorption of fat in breast cancer patients compared to matched healthy controls. This will provide required information that is necessary to implement new strategies to develop optimal nutritional regimen in breast cancer patients. The hypothesis is that chemotherapy in breast cancer is related to altered gut function and absorption and to increases in fat synthesis that lead to fat accumulation. In addition we will examine the effect of cancer chemotherapy and gender by comparing fat digestion/absorption and fat metabolism of the breast cancer before and after chemotherapy to aged matched healthy female and male controls.    ,NCT01890824

Breast Cancer,Loss of Grip Strength BMI and Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Breast Cancer, Early stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer is typically treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy in order to decrease risk of breast cancer recurrence and to improve overall survival from the disease. Typical agents used for treatment include tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors. In postmenopausal women aromatase inhibitor therapy is increasingly common because it is associated with fewer long-term serious toxicities compared to tamoxifen. However aromatase inhibitors cause arthralgias in 40-50% of patients which can influence adherence to therapy and can lead to treatment discontinuation in a minority of cases. The mechanism underlying development of this toxicity remains unclear and predictors of who will develop these symptoms remain undefined. Initial reports suggest that grip strength decreases during aromatase inhibitor therapy and that body-mass index may influence development of this symptom. Therefore this longitudinal study has been developed to determine change in grip strength over time in women treated with aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen as well as to identify potential associations between change in grip strength and BMI. Patient self-reported symptoms will also be collected. A total of 115 women with early stage breast cancer who are initiating therapy with either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen will be enrolled.    ,NCT01896050

Breast Cancer,Localization of Nonpalpable Breast Lesions, Each year the Danish mammography-screening programme identifies a large number of patients with small non-palpable breast cancers or precancerous lesions. The majority of these patients are suitable for breast conserving surgery (BCS). The object of BCS is to remove the suspicious lesion completely without removing excess healthy breast tissue. To obtain this accurate lesion localization is essential. Until today the standard procedure in Denmark has been wire guided localization (WGL). Although the method has been utilized for a number of years it has several disadvantages. Often inaccurate lesion localization leads to incomplete lesion removal (positive margin) and subsequently reoperation. It can postpone the additional systemic treatment offered after the operation. Other disadvantages are poor cosmetic outcome and inconvenient planning for the patient and the departments involved. The wire needs to be placed on the day of the operation which decreases the flexibility of the procedure. The purpose of this study is to test a new method named radioactive seed localization (RSL). The method uses a small titanium seed containing radioactive iodine. It will be placed in the centre of the lesion and during the operation the surgeon can locate it with a handheld gamma probe. The seed can be placed a few days in advance which means a more flexible course of treatment. The method seems promising with regards to reoperation rates but it needs further testing. Hypothesis: RSL is a more accurate method for localization of nonpalpable breast lesions than WGL. Using RSL obtains to a great extent adequate negative margins resulting in a reduced number of re-operations. The study will be performed as a randomised clinical trial where the two methods will be compared to each other. The trial will be performed at the department of breast surgery at Rigshospitalet and include patients with nonpalpable breast lesions. Besides reoperation rates duration of the surgical procedure and the amount of removed breast tissue will be compared.    ,NCT01901991

Breast Cancer,Low Dose Molecular Breast Imaging as a Screening Tool for Women With Dense Breasts, A new test for breast cancer screening molecular breast imaging (MBI) may be more sensitive than mammography for detecting breast cancer in women with dense breasts. The purpose of this study is to see if MBI using a low dose of gamma radiation can find cancers not seen on mammography. Hypotheses: 1. Low-Dose MBI has a significantly higher sensitivity and specificity and equal or higher positive predictive value than SM in women age 40 and older with mammographically dense breasts. 2. Low-dose MBI has comparable sensitivity and specificity to that previously achieved with MBI using a higher dose of radiation. 3. MBI produces a low false positive rate (specificity >90%) that permits its use as a screening tool in this patient population.    ,NCT01925170

Patients who have completed the first 6 cycles of intravenous Herceptin as part of the (neo)adjuvant treatment will be eligible to receive a further 12 cycles of Herceptin in this study. For the first 3 cycles Herceptin will be administered intravenously (6 mg/kg) at the hospital. The next 3 cycles Herceptin (600 mg every 3 weeks) will be administered subcutaneously via a hand-held syringe by a trained HCP at the hospital and for the last 6 cycles Herceptin will be administered subcutaneously via a hand-held syringe by a trained HCP at the patient's home.    ,NCT01926886
Breast Cancer,Adjuvant Treatment Recommendation and Oncotype DX® in Early Breast Cancer, Oncotype DX® is likely to become more widely used in Europe as well as in Switzerland. The test is currently not reimbursed by the Swiss health insurances. The proposed study will investigate to what extent adjuvant treatment recommendations in breast cancer patients with an ER-positive tumor made by Swiss tumor boards are based on conventional factors and whether the recommendations would change when RS results from the Oncotype DX® test were available. In addition this study approaches the dilemma of adding adjuvant CT to adjuvant endocrine therapy in a systematic fashion. In this study the St. Gallen consensus 2009 (with a minor update from the 2011 consensus is used to predefine the patients suitable for endocrine therapy or chemo-endocrine therapy. Once results of this study are available they may help to better integrate Oncotype DX® with other factors. Currently it is unclear how the different factors should be integrated into one recommendation. This study will provide data on the usefulness of this test for the two patient groups which are suitable for hormone therapy only and for those who are considered for hormone plus chemotherapy.    ,NCT01926964
Breast Cancer,18F-FDG PET Metabolic Phenotype in Evaluating Therapeutic Response for Breast Cancer Patients With Bone Metastases., This study is to evaluate the effectiveness of 18F-FDG PET in following up of metastastic bone lesions and in predicting outcome for breast cancer patients after therapy. Primary outcome: Using 18F-FDG uptake to evaluate the metastatic bone status after treatment. The PET results will be compared with the results in Tc-99m MDP bone scintigraphy. Secondary outcome: Evaluate the relationship between the 18F-FDG uptake of the metastatic bone lesions and (1) breast cancer related tumor marker (2) patients' survival.    ,NCT01927939
Breast Cancer,Partial Irradiation and Sequential vs. Concurrent Chemo Early Breast Cancer, Women with ER negative breast cancer have a higher risk of the cancer returning in the breast after whole or partial breast radiation than women with ER positive breast cancer. In a small study at Johns Hopkins women were treated with partial breast irradiation and chemotherapy given at the same time. This combined treatment was safe and women with ER negative breast cancer did just as well as women with ER positive cancer. We are now testing in a bigger study whether giving partial breast irradiation and chemotherapy at the same time (our new method) has the same side effects and outcomes as giving partial breast irradiation and chemotherapy at different times(older method). In this study women who had their breast cancer removed but need radiation to the breast will be randomized to partial breast irradiation at the same time as chemotherapy or partial breast radiation at a different time than chemotherapy. Randomization is like flipping a coin but in this study about 2 of every 3 women will get the new method.    ,NCT01928589

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of the Efficacy of Hippocampal Avoidance on the Cognitive Toxicity of Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy After Surgical Resection of Single Brain Metastasis of Breast Cancer," The incidence of brain metastases (BM) in metastatic breast cancer is increasing due to the improvement in the control of systemic disease and due to an improved detection through imagery. The treatment management of single BM remains controversial. Indeed even though it is widely accepted that local treatment increases the median survival time in patients having a good prognostic status the adding of ""adjuvant"" whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is currently subject to controversy due to its potential toxicity. Yet two randomized trials have demonstrated a clear increase in intra-cerebral recurrence and in death from neurologic origin in case of absence of ""adjuvant"" WBRT without change in overall survival (but overall survival was not a primary endpoint in any of these studies). The data from literature on cognitive toxicity (CT) of WBRT on BM are scarce and sometimes controversial. CT of WBRT affects the subcortical frontal functions. It is postulated that the alteration of hippocampal neurogenesis (mainly due to inflammation process) situated in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus has an essential role in the development of these brain dysfunctions. It has been shown that the incidence of BM in the hippocampal region (hippocampus + 5mm expansion) is low in the range of 86%. New irradiation techniques in particular intensity-modulated radiotherapy associated with rotational radiotherapy allow to modulate the dose on an intra-cerebral structure all the while distributing an adapted dose to the remaining brain. This prospective randomized study will compare through a battery of neuropsychological tests the cognitive impact of WBRT of 40 Gy in 20 fractions with or without hippocampal avoidance by intensity modulated radiotherapy in patients presenting with a single operated brain metastasis of breast cancer. If the hippocampal avoidance leads to a significant improvement in cognitive function this radiotherapy scheme could become the standard postoperative treatment to be proposed to patients presenting the best prognostic factors. This would allow to prevent long-term cognitive deficit while preserving WBRT benefit on intra-cerebral control. Justification of evaluation criteria : Principal criteria : Evaluation criteria to assess cognitive toxicity have been selected on the basis of the recommendations from C. Meyers and P. Brown who propose an adapted test battery to evaluate memory verbal function visual and motor coordination and executive function. The selected tests have been validated also in French. They comprise HVLT-R (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised) COWAT (Controlled Oral Word Association Test) Grooved Pegboard test TMT A and B (Trailmaking tests A and B) and MMSE. The calculation of patient numbers was based on the HVLT-R test as memory is thought to be the most frequently affected domain. The tests will be performed before treatment (""baseline"" cognitive function) at 4 months and at 12 months. In case of a missing answer to the evaluation tests the reason(s) for not answering will be noted. Secondary criteria : Quality of life : QLQ-C30 QLQ-BN20 ADL IADL Intra-cerebral Progression-free survival (PFS) Overall survival.    ",NCT01942980

Breast Cancer,The PIONEER-01 Pivotal Study of the Imagio Breast Imaging System, Imagio is a multi-modality device comprised of opto-acoustic (OA) imaging co-registered with diagnostic grey-scale (B mode) ultrasound that has been designed to concurrently collect OA images in conjunction with diagnostic grey-scale (B-mode) ultrasound. Imagio is expected to identify two functional hallmarks of a potential malignancy: the presence of abnormal blood vessels (angiogenesis); and the relative reduction in oxygen content of hemoglobin. The technology is non-invasive and does not require any contrast agent or radio-isotope which is required for other modalities such as MRI or PET. This is a prospective single arm controlled multi-center observational study that will compare Imagio versus conventional diagnostic ultrasound (CDU) for the visualization of suspicious masses.    ,NCT01943916
Breast Cancer,Effect of Midazolam Premedication Before Induction on the Functional Recovery After General Anesthesia in the Patients Undergoing Breast Surgery Due to Breast Cancer, Normally higher levels of preoperational stress or anxiety affect behavior and recovery after the operation. Moreover patients undergoing mastectomy are usually young women and this demographic is known to experience higher levels of stress and anxiety than any other. Anesthetizing patients involves more than just anesthesia in operation; it also includes all of the preoperative treatments for optimizing a patient's condition and promoting quick postoperative recovery. Pharmacological premedication for anxiolysis or amnesia before anesthesia has been a common means of sedation that many studies have investigated. However such studies have focused on alleviating patients' anxiety and on how far patients can obey induction for sedation; there has been no research on post-operational prognoses the ultimate purpose of reducing anxiety. The well-known effect of pharmacological premedication is to reduce the capacity of the anesthetic. However it is not confirmed whether this effect leads to better recovery after anesthesia as this question has not been researched. Furthermore recently some have argued strongly that premedication actually prolongs recovery and that it does not need to be applied to every patient. Recently therefore the use of pharmacological premedication has been left to the discretion of institutes or doctors in many cases. Among types of premedication midazolam belongs to the class of short-acting benzodiazepines and is frequently used as it induces meaningful anterograde amnesia and causes fewer aftereffects such as respiratory problems. In addition its effects have already been demonstrated. However research on the improvement of functional health after anesthesia?i.e. patients' quick return to normal life?is still poor and needs to be advanced. When measuring the degree of recovery recent studies tend to focus on measuring how quickly patients are able to return to normal life rather than the recovery of specific symptoms. To this end the most widely used method is the Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR-40) survey. It has a total of 40 items which are classified into five categories: emotional state physical comfort psychological support physical independence and pain. Questions are answered using a 5-point scale with 1 being worst and 5 being best. It takes 6.3 minutes on average to complete and its test-retest reliability internal consistency and split-half coefficient have led it to be recognized as the most effective survey method. Moreover it has been used in many studies investigating how the type of operation method of anesthesia additional medication and gender affect anesthesia and the operation. Its validity for such research has been verified. Therefore investigators can investigate the degree of postoperational functional recovery through the QoR-40 by comparing cases in which an operation is performed with or without midazolam.    ,NCT01945476

Breast Cancer,Accountability for Cancer Care Through Undoing Racism and Equity," Purpose: African American cancer patients as compared to their White counterparts continue to initiate treatment later and remain less apt to undergo complete treatment; fueling worse treatment outcomes including shorter survival. The concepts of ""transparency"" and ""accountability"" as mechanisms of systems change have been applied for decades by anti-racism organizations to civil rights and social change. Yet the application of these concepts to health systems' change and unequal treatment has rarely been done. The Greensboro Health Disparities Collaborative and two Cancer Centers have joined together to specify structures built into cancer care systems that make cancer care vulnerable to institutional racism and investigate how they can be changed to reduce racial inequity in quality and completion of treatment for Stage 1-2 breast and lung cancer patients. Participants: White and African American patients with first diagnosis of Stage 1-2 breast and lung cancer with intention to treat and their cancer care staff at 2 cancer centers. The 2 cancer centers are Cone Health Cancer Center (CHCC) in Greensboro North Carolina and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Hillman Comprehensive Cancer Center in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. Procedures (methods): Using a 5-year interrupted time-series with an embedded randomized control trial (RCT) study design we will test the effectiveness of the ACCURE intervention components. Having received Institutional Review Board approval for Phase 1 we completed a 5-year retrospective review of de-identified Electronic Medical Record data to establish a baseline of repeated outcome measures convening of an expert committee to design the intervention and design of the real-time electronic breast and lung cancer registry coupled with dummy testing of the registry system. The randomized trial will compare patients who receive usual care to those who receive visits and calls from a trained ACCURE Navigator who is well versed in issues specific to breast and lung cancer and trained to serve as a two-way communication bridge to optimize the cancer care system's accountability and transparency for equity in quality of care. Given unintended but likely variation in implementation of the ACCURE intervention by the two Cancer Centers (at our two research sites) 6 elements of implementation and their potential effect on outcomes will be documented through a process evaluation.

Breast Cancer,Exercise to Prevent Aromatase Inhibitor Side Effects in Breast Cancer Patients, Hormone receptor-positive tumors are the most common breast cancers in postmenopausal women and drug therapies which block the production or effects of estrogen are the mainstay of treatment in these patients. Due to their effectiveness in postmenopausal women aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the standard of care for long-term estrogen suppression in these patients. Estrogen deficiency however results in multiple side effects. Some of the most common side effects in women taking AIs are joint and muscle aches which promote physical deconditioning. Because of the long term use of AIs in postmenopausal breast cancer patients and the improvements in cancer-related outcomes that are observed with their use identifying methods to reduce these side effects to maintain adherence to treatment is important. Exercise interventions in breast cancer patients also improve quality of life and reduce fatigue. Understanding the role of exercise in AI side effect prevention will allow us to translate these findings into therapy guidelines.    ,NCT01954706

Breast Cancer,Stereotactic Directional Vacuum-Assisted Breast Biopsy, Stereotactic directional vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (ST DVAB) is a standard biopsy procedure for suspicious findings on mammograms in Western countries for more than 10 years [1-3] it has replaced the needle localization (NLOC) excisional biopsy for the lesions alike and was reported to feature a high sensitivity very low delayed false-negative rate (less than 2%)[45]. Moreover it causes less scarring less psychologic stress to patients and less morbidity compared with needle localization excisional biopsy [67]. However its sensitivity accuracy has seldom been reported in Asian countries [8]  since most Asian women have different breast parenchyma pattern different breast cancer prevalence. Therefore we retrospectively reviewed outcomes of the two groups of patients receiving either ST DVAB or NLOC excisional biopsy trying to investigate if ST DVAB can be an effective alternative to NLOC excisional biopsy in our country.    ,NCT01957020

Breast Cancer,RPFNA Assessment of Exercise Effect in Breast Cancer, This study is being done to see if the investigators can measure changes that occur in breast tissue when women at risk of developing breast cancer start an exercise program. The investigators are interested in studying this because research shows that women who exercise regularly are less likely to develop breast cancer but there is not very much information explaining how exercise could affect breast cells in a way to prevent cancer from occurring. In this research study the investigators will use a research technique called breast random fine needle aspiration (RPFNA) to test breast cells for their shape and how they look. The investigators will look at breast cells before and after a participant takes part in an exercise program to see if the investigators are able to see any changes in breast cells that could have happened due to the exercise program. This research will help us to develop larger projects to see if exercise programs could be helpful in preventing breast cancer.    ,NCT01961128

Breast Cancer,A Continuing Cancer Service Model Emphasizing on Functional Restoration: Model for Breast Cancer, Background and Purposes: Cancer is the leading cause of our mortality. It threatens people's life and quality of life (QOL). Although the incidence of cancer is still rising with the promotion of cancer screening and progression of medical technology its survival rate is improving. However the sequels from cancer or its treatment and the side effects impact the patients along with their lives. Breast cancer is the most incident cancer in women with high survival rate continuing care after the diagnosis and treatment is much more needed. This study is using breast cancer as an example to establish a continuing service model. This study aims (1) to establish a tailored continuing care model which emphasizes on breast cancer patients' function. (2) To investigate the effectiveness of the new care model comparing with the control. (3) To find a cutting point of bioelectrical impedance to identify late development of lymphedema. Methods: This is a randomized-controlled trial expanding for 3 years. Women being newly diagnosed with breast cancer and first OPD visit after operation at National Taiwan University Hospital will be invited to join the surveillance and care system. Exclusion criteria are: younger than 20 years old stage IV recurrent or both sides involved with other cancer diagnosis functional impairments from previous injury or operation on the affected upper extremity and other physical or mental problem to influence the test or filling the questionnaire. It is estimated there will be 100 subjects participate this study every year. After the initial evaluation they will be randomly allocated to surveillance group (SG) or general care group (CG). Totally in this three-year study there will be 200 subjects (100/group) follow-up for 0.5 to 2 years. SG will have health education brochure and free class from the first visit post-operatively but CG will only have the brochure. Moreover SG will be screened every time when they visit the clinics. If there is any early sign of impairment professional advice and counseling will be given additionally. In these visits if CG raises any health-related question they can be answered. Detailed physical examination to identify their impairments and QOL are at 3 6 12 18 24 months after operation for both groups. Patients' characteristics functional status QOL will be presented by descriptive statistics. T-test/Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare the differences between patients in two groups. Survival analysis and log-rank test will be used to show the prevalence of various functional impairments and test their difference. ROC curve will be used to find the cutting point for prediction of lymphedema. Expected Results: It is expected (1) to set up the education program and brochure for breast cancer patients. (2) to establish a continuing surveillance and care model for breast cancer patients and extending to all cancers. (3) Women in the new care model will have less impairment and higher QOL comparing with women at the same post-operative stage. (4) To find out the prevalence of functional impairments from the data of control group. (5) A cutting point of bioelectrical impedance to identify late development of lymphedema will be found. (6) To train the team members of cancer care and research.    ,NCT01963572

Breast Cancer,Outpatient Clinic for Late Outcome for Breast Carcinoma in MAASTRO Clinic., In order to evaluate the late outcome in patients curatively treated for breast cancer a special outpatient clinic will be developed. There are two main purposes of the outpatient clinic. The first purpose is evaluating the results of the radiation treatment by mapping A) late toxicity and B) tumour control and survival. The second purpose is that this outpatient clinic for late outcome will also function as a pilot for a new CAT (Computer Assisted Theragnostics abbreviated CAT project) in which multiple late outcome variables will be recorded. In this pilot we want to investigate whether physical presence of the patient on the outpatient clinic allowing physical examination has any added value to the questionnaires filled in by the patient at home. The ultimate aim of this new CAT project is to use these multicentric data to develop models for predicting both oncological outcome and late side effects. Insight in the beneficial and adverse effects of a certain treatment using these predictive models will be required choose the optimal treatment for the individual patient using a shared decision making process.    ,NCT01978756

Breast Cancer,Effect of Chemotherapy on Pain Sensitivity and Patient-reported Symptoms, Many breast cancer survivors report chronic pain that develops or worsens following chemotherapy. The impact of chemotherapy on the development of chronic pain is uncertain. In this proposal we are studying the impact of chemotherapy on a patient's sensitivity to pain. We are also investigating whether a patient's sensitivity to pain is related to how many symptoms she experiences during treatment.    ,NCT01983982
Breast Cancer,Examining the Relationships Between Sleep Fatigue and Pain in Aromatase Inhibitor-treated Patients, Aromatase inhibitors are commonly prescribed for treatment of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. These medications can cause side effects in some women and occasionally they can be quite bothersome. We are doing a study to better understand the side effects of aromatase inhibitors so that we can hopefully treat them better or possibly prevent them. In particular we are interested in pain and difficulty sleeping. This study is designed to assess the effect of aromatase inhibitors on pain sleep quality and fatigue and the interplay of these side effects and their subsequent impact on daily activity. Each participant will fill out a series of questionnaires about pain sleep quality and fatigue and will also complete a sleep diary and wear an actigraphy watch for 10 days before starting an aromatase inhibitor and after taking it for 3 months. We hope to learn more about these symptoms so we can better manage medication toxicity in the future.    ,NCT01983995

Breast Cancer,IORT (Intra-operative Radiation Therapy) in Early Stage Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational way to provide radiation therapy to treat breast cancer at the time of surgery. Traditionally the recommended treatment for early stage breast cancer is surgery to remove the tumor followed by whole breast radiation therapy to decrease the chance of recurrence of the cancer. Whole breast radiation involves daily radiation treatments for 4-6 weeks and can be associated with damage to other tissues including the skin. Recent technological advances have made it possible to provide radiation treatment during the breast cancer surgical procedure. This procedure is called intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). The University of Virginia has a unique IORT system which allows for the inclusion of cutting edge imaging technology into the IORT procedure in order to provide delivery of radiation directly to the needed areas and to avoid radiation to other tissues.    ,NCT01988870

Breast Cancer,Randomized Controlled Single-blind Trial to Evaluate the Mobile Tracking of Symptoms in Ambulatory Breast Cancer Patients, Health care has an increasingly demand for mobile applications (App) but studies are rare which explore the added value and benefits for patient and physician. Patients in different disease groups or physicians from different specialties are likely to have different demands. Research should focus on selected groups to better understand their individual demands. Our study intends to identify the added value of mobile symptom tracking in a selected subgroup of patients. We designed an App for breast cancer patients who receive ambulant chemotherapy in a breast center. The patients track regularly their well-being and adverse events (AE) with the smartphone- or web-app and share it with the physician in the medical consultation. The data entry was designed to meet patient needs based on previous usability testing. The reporting of AE and well-being are standardized according to the definitions by CTCAE 4.0 and ECOG-Index to ensure the reliability of patient self-reporting. The primary outcomes are the number of reported AE the influence on their subjective well-being and the acceptance of context specific information. We will include 150 participants in this study. The calculated power is 91% respectively 80% for a 10 % improvement of well-being and a 2.2 increase of detected AEs. The results will be compared to patients without App and to patients with App but without shared information.   -  Trial with medical device    ,NCT02004496

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of a Novel Infra-red Breast Imaging System for Risk Assessment in Women at High Risk for Breast Cancer., Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging (3D MIRA) is a new infrared imaging technology using the Real Imager 4(RI4) developed by Real Imaging. This technology generates 3D metabolic maps and based on sophisticated machine learning technology provides objective risk assessment for the presence of malignant tumor. The procedure is non-invasive comfortable and does not involve ionizing radiation. Moreover Real Imaging's 3D Functional MIRA is unaffected by breast density and is therefore ideal for evaluating patients with mammographically dense breasts. The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the ability of this novel technology to detect clinically occult breast cancer in a cohort of women that are at high risk for breast cancer. We hypothesize that the combination of screening mammography and metabolic screening (3D MIRA) will result in significantly higher breast cancer detection rates.    ,NCT02009150

Breast Cancer,Presurgical Treatment With Letrozole in Patients With Early-stage Breast Cancer., Some tumors use estrogen in the body to assist with growth. Letrozole is a drug that is prevents cells from producing estrogens. This should assist with the slowing of growth of tumor cells. Letrozole also promotes cell destruction by inhibiting a cellular destruction pathway. The objectives of this study will look at the differences between the cellular destruction pathway before and after letrozole use and the differences in the cellular destruction pathway in participants that have received letrozole versus those who did not. The study will also look at a gene in all participants called Ki67. This gene is associated with the rate of tumor cell growth. The study will measure the levels of Ki67 and compare them to the amount of activation of the cellular destruction pathway. Participants in this study will have undergone a diagnostic biopsy of their breast tissue. In order to meet these objectives one group of participants (Arm A) will not receive letrozole. Tissue leftover from their diagnostic biopsy will be treated with RAD001 (Everolimus) in the laboratory and the effects of this drug on the cellular destruction pathway will be studied. The other group of participants (Arm B) will take letrozole for a minimum of 10 and maximum of 21 days. They will have a second tumor sample taken as part of their surgical procedure completed to remove the tumor tissue. Any differences in the cellular destruction pathway before and after exposure to letrozole will be measured.    ,NCT02010021

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs Molecular Breast Imaging (Tc-MBI) in Breast Cancer Patients, The objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of Tc-99m Sestamibi Molecular Breast Imaging as an imaging modality for breast cancer screening. Tc-MBI has shown significantly higher sensitivity and equivalent specificity in the detection of breast cancer among high risk women when compared to mammography. However there is little published data comparing Tc-MBI to MRI for evaluating extent of disease in women with known breast cancer. The study will target twenty (20) women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who are scheduled to undergo biopsy of additional suspicious lesions that were identified on standard of care contrast- enhanced breast MRI. Prior to the biopsy these subjects will receive a Tc-MBI scan of the breast. The results from both imaging methods will be compared to histological findings. These results may be used to design larger and more comprehensive studies with an overarching goal to determine if there is a role for Tc-MBI in the pre-operative evaluation of patients with known breast cancer.    ,NCT02024074

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Response to Two Schedules of Capecitabine in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of a novel schedule of an oral anticancer drug capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Mathematical models have predicted that 7 days of capecitabine followed by 7 days of rest is an optimal dosing schedule for this drug and previous studies done al Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center support the tolerability of this scheme. This definitive randomized trial comparing the efficacy of the new dosage with the conventional dosing schedule in patients with metastatic breast cancer is necessary and we hypothesize it will be superior in terms of efficacy. Dosing schedules based on mathematical predictions for optimal drug delivery based on efficacy rather than toxicity could facilitate more rapid and economical drug development.

Breast Cancer,Sentinel Node Biopsy Before and/or After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to investigate if sentinel lymph node biopsy is a reliable staging tool for breast cancer patients planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (=before breast surgery) and if in that case it is safe to omit axillary lymph node dissection if the sentinel lymph node is free of metastasis.    ,NCT02031042
Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Two Techniques for the SLN Detection in BC Patients," The revision of our data shows that since its introduction in our institution (Jules Bordet Institute) in 1998 (until 2010 the year of the last review of cases) 53 patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy before selective sentinel lymph node dissection followed by conventional axillary dissection. The analysis of these cases shows that:   -  The lack of demonstration of sentinel lymph nodes observed in 8 cases (6 cN0) is associated in 75% of them with a pN+ status   -  If scintigraphic imaging is ""positive"" (demonstration of the sentinel lymph nodes: 35 cN0 and 10 cN+) our results appear favorable with a single false negative SLN result (False Negative Rate = 1/20 or 5%). Therefore we propose additional technique for LN detection by indocyanine green we hypothesize that the combination of two different injections improves the technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy.

Breast Cancer,Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Guided Tomographic Optical Breast Imaging (TOBI), Screening for breast cancer improves early detection of aggressive cancers and has been shown to reduce breast cancer related mortality. Currently mammography is the most effective way of detecting early stage non palpable breast cancers. However mammography only reveals the breast structure and cannot say much about the breast physiological state. We propose Tomographic Optical Breast Imaging (TOBI) as an inexpensive patient friendly technique that is non-invasive and does not use non-ionizing radiation. TOBI uses near infrared light and by measuring how such light passes through the breast images of blood volume and hemoglobin oxygenation can be obtained. In this study TOBI is combined with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT a form of 3D mammography) and our hypothesis is that the TOBI-DBT combined images can be used to diagnose breast cancer with significantly improved sensitivity and specificity compared to DBT alone.    ,NCT02033486

Breast Cancer,19F Hot Spot MRI of Human Adipose-derived Stem Cells for Breast Reconstruction, Six female patients (>18 years of age pre-menopausal) who have had loco-regional (lumpectomy and radiation) therapy for breast carcinoma and have been at least one-year disease free will undergo liposuction the autologous SVF cell fraction will be isolated and labeled with CS-1000 in the operating room without entering cell culture which will then be returned to the patient at the site of breast grafting. Patients will receive a pre-screening MRI . Patients will have an MRI scans over a period of 1 month at Johns Hopkins. Follow-up MRIs at 612 and 18 months will also be performed. Only at Johns Hopkins with fluorine being done as part of this investigational study. By performing fluorine MRI and quantification of 19F signal we hypothesize that the engraftment of transplanted cells can be tracked in ways not possible before using the total fluorine signal as surrogate marker for cell persistence and survival. We expect that a clinically successful outcome (maintenance of breast contour and volume) will be positively correlated with cell survival. The outcome of this study may pave the way for using 19F MRI cell tracking as a new tool for stem cell therapy in a variety of clinical applications.    ,NCT02035085

Breast Cancer,A Study of Palbociclib in Combination With Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Hormone Receptor Positive HER2 Negative Invasive Breast Cancer, This research study is evaluating a drug called Palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy as a possible treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.   -  Palbociclib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Palbociclib blocks activity of two closely related enzymes (proteins that help chemical reactions in the body occur) called Cyclin D Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). These proteins are part of a pathway or a sequence of steps which is known to regulate cell growth. Laboratory testing has suggested palbociclib may stop the growth of hormone receptor positive breast cancer.   -  Endocrine therapy prevents breast cancer cell growth by blocking estrogen stimulation. During this study endocrine therapy will either be tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. It is standard of care for premenopausal women to take tamoxifen and for postmenopausal women to take either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen after a diagnosis of hormone receptor positive breast cancer.    ,NCT02040857

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Needle Core Biopsy of Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node in Breast Cancer, The purpose of the study is to determine if it is possible to identify and perform a needle biopsy of the sentinel lymph node. The investigators hope to identify breast cancer cells in the lymph nodes under the arm without making an operation necessary. The rationale for this study is that for patients without enlarged lymph nodes under the arm sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard way of determining if breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes under the arm. While the complications from a sentinel lymph node dissection are less than that of a complete axillary lymph node dissection sentinel lymph node dissection still carries small risks of arm swelling decreased movement fluid collections nerve injury and pain. Furthermore the majority of sentinel lymph nodes do not contain cancer. The investigators hope to develop a method to find cancer in the axillary lymph nodes and avoid the complications of an operation.    ,NCT02046057

Breast Cancer,Sentinel Node Biopsy in Breast Cancner: Omission of Axillary Clearance After Micrometastasis, Sentinel node (SN) biopsy in breast cancer has been demonstrated to be a reliable method and several follow-up studies have shown that it is safe to refrain from completion axillary clearance (axillary lymph node dissection ALND) in SN-negative patients. SN biopsy alone results in significantly less arm discomfort following the operation. However as a surprisingly low frequency of axillary relapse has been observed in patients without any axillary intervention (neither SN biopsy nor axillary clearance) or without completion ALND after a positive SN biopsy the importance of ALND is being questioned even for patients with SN metastases. A large randomized study (ISBCG23-1) was not able to show any differences in 5-year disease-free survival between patients with SN micrometastases who had undergone ALND and those who had not. This Swedish multicenter study will include patients with SN micrometastases. These women will not undergo ALND but will be registered in a study cohort. The patients will otherwise be treated in accordance with the national guidelines and will be clinically followed every year for five years after 10 years and finally after 15 years. Hypothesis: To refrain from axillary clearance in breast cancer patients with sentinel node micrometastases does not impair survival.    ,NCT02049632

Breast Cancer,Behavioral Weight Loss and Exercise After Treatment (BEAT), Overweight and physically inactive breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality. Cancer treatment-related changes that likely mediate weight loss and exercise success include the long term effects such as fatigue psychological distress and impaired executive (cognitive) function. This study will explore the variability in how breast cancer survivors respond to a behavioral weight loss intervention. The primary objectives include determining the degree to which success with a behavioral weight loss intervention in overweight breast cancer survivors is explained by measures of executive function as measured with task performance at 6 and 12 months and associated brain function imaging (fMRI) collected at baseline only.Additionally the study is designed to determine the degree to which selected measures of cancer-related symptoms account for variance in the success of breast cancer survivors at 6 and 12 months following entry into a behavioral weight loss and exercise intervention.    ,NCT02052115
Breast Cancer,TRIal evalUating the Menstrual and Ovarian Function of Young Breast Cancer Patients Treated With a cycloPHosphamide-free Regimen, Recently there has been a rising trend of delaying childbearing and hence more women are diagnosed with breast cancer before completing their families. Given the continuous decline in recurrences and death secondary to breast cancer and the reassuring data on the safety of pregnancy following breast cancer more women are inquiring into the possibility of preserving fertility following chemotherapy. The challenge remains in using a regimen that is devoid of cyclophosphamide but is as effective as the standard regimens that incorporate cyclophosphamide. The combination doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) (AP) followed by 12 weeks of paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) (P) emerges as a treatment option with convincing results regarding its effectiveness in the early setting and could be potentially associated with less ovarian toxicity being devoid of cyclophosphamide.    ,NCT02053597

Breast Cancer,Medico-economic Study of Three Strategies of Sentinel Lymph Node Analysis in Operable Breast Cancer," Breast carcinoma requires frequently an adjuvant therapy after surgical excision: in this way one of the major criteria indicating the need of adjuvant chemotherapy is the diagnosis of a metastatic lymph-node invasion mainly in the axillary field. Axillary surgery is therefore mandatory at the diagnosis of breast carcinoma. For many years in order to avoid unnecessary complications due to extensive axillary surgery (for instance arm enlargement by lymphedema) a limited surgery is frequently performed on the first supposed invaded lymph-nodes (LN) called ""sentinel"" LN technique; if the sentinel LN are not invaded extensive axillary surgery can be omitted. To decide it during the surgery removed sentinel LN are cut in 3 to 4 slices which are examined immediately as smears (cytology) or frozen slices (pathology). However due to hazard in cutting the LN micro-metastases can be misdiagnosed. That is why a recent molecular biology method has been developed in which the total LN are crushed and blended then analyzed by OSNA technique (One Step Nuclear Acid analysis) so as to amplify and detect the mRNA coding for cytokeratin-19 protein witnessing the LN metastatic invasion. A standardized automated technique is available with a mean time of 30 to 50 minutes according to the number of analyzed LN. In 12 international studies (2830 cases) the consistency between OSNA technique and final pathology is of 91 to 98% and the sensitivity seems higher. Less than 5% of all breast carcinomas cells don't express CK-19 protein. The use of OSNA technique requires a dedicated machine and a skilled pathologist increasing slightly the operation time; however it allows to avoid the immediate and long-term complications due to the radical LN axillary surgery in case of negativity of the sentinel LN procedure. To date the three techniques including extemporaneous examinations (OSNA or classical methods) or not (classical pathological analysis) have their own advantages and drawbacks. ""SAGE"" study main objective is to compare these three techniques in terms of direct costs and Quality of Life impacts. The superiority of any of these three techniques is not the purpose of SAGE study but the economic burden of OSNA technique in comparison with the 2 others in the standard setting in France. Quality of Life and Pain evaluations will be performed immediately after surgery and during the 6 months after.    ",NCT02056886

The trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for ER(ER-α)/PR negative ER-β positive operable breast cancer patients. 688 female ER(ER-α)/PR negative ER-β(wild type ER-β1) positive operable breast cancer patients who had undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy or directly modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery were randomly (1:1) enrolled to receive tamoxifen (20 mg per day) or placebo (2# per day) within 6 weeks after postoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy if needed (according to 2013 NCCN breast cancer guideline). If the breast tumor's HER2 is positive the patient can receive targeted therapy (Herceptin) combined with tamoxifen or placebo. The follow-up time will be eight years. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for ER(ER-α)/PR negative ER-β positive operable breast cancer patients by comparing the DFS and OS between tamoxifen group and placebo group and to determine whether the percentage of positive ER-β expression is associated with the response to the hormone therapy in breast cancer.    ,NCT02062489

OctavaPink is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test service performed by authorized clinical laboratories. The product is used for two following indications:   -  Intend of Use #1: OctavaPink is indicated for women above 18 years old who performed mammography and were determined negative for breast cancer. Being moderately sensitive (>55% sensitivity) the test is able to detect 55% of mammography false negatives. In addition being highly specific (>95% specificity) it supplies additional evidence for true mammography negative result which will reduce examinees anxiety of being misdiagnosed as a result of high false negative mammography rate (10-30%)   -  Intend of Use #2: OctavaPink is indicated for women above 18 years old who performed biopsy after positive mammography and the biopsy result was negative. Being moderately sensitive (>55% sensitivity) the test is able to detect 55% of biopsy false negatives. In addition being highly specific (>95% specificity) it supplies an additional evidence for true biopsy negative result which reduces examinees anxiety of being misdiagnosed. OctavBlue is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test service performed by EventusDx authorized laboratories. Intend of use of OctavBlue is the following: ??OctavBlue is indicated for women above 18 years old who performed mammography and received doubtful results. Being highly sensitive (>95% sensitivity) the test can help to reveal 95% of positive cases; and being moderately specific (>55% specificity) - about half of negative cases.

Breast Cancer,Tomosynthesis (TS) Versus Ultrasonography (US) in Women With Dense Breast, Hypothesis The study aims to demonstrate at least equivalence or non-significant difference between TS and US in women with dense breast screened negative at 2D Mammography. If the equivalence between TS and US will be demonstrated US may be substituted by TS with great benefits for the patients and for the healthcare resources. Aims   1. Assess if TS may detect additional cancers in dense breast that approximate US detection capability but with less false positive findings than US.   2. If TS detects new cancers in dense breast similarly to US (approximate rate or marginally lower rate) evaluate the the true positive/false positive ratio.   3. Cost-analysis. In case of less false positives detected by TS the true-positive / false positive trade-off might be strongly in favour of TS with a great potential of costs reduction.    ,NCT02066142

Breast Cancer,CRIZENT: Crizotinib and Sunitinib in Metastatic Breast Cancer," Crizotinib is a medication that is taken by mouth. It has shown that it can help slow down or stop the growth of tumor cells. The marketing name of the drug is ""Xalkori"". It has been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to treat other types of metastatic cancer but the investigators believe it may be helpful to treat breast cancer as well. Sunitinib is the other medication used in the study. It is also taken by mouth in the form of a capsule. The marketing name of this drug is ""Sutent"". It too has been approved by the FDA to treat other types of cancer but not for breast cancer. In this study the investigators will be combining both of these two treatments but at different doses. One third of the patients will take Crizotinib 200 mg twice daily with Sunitinib 25.0 mg once a day. One third of the patients will take Crizotinib 250 mg twice daily with Sunitinib 25.0 mg once a day and One third of the patients will take Crizotinib 250 mg twice daily with Sunitinib 37.5 mg once a day.

Breast Cancer,Correlation Between Genetic Variants and Long-term Cardiac Effects Induced by Doxorubicin in Breast Cancer Patients, The purpose of this study is to identify the genetic variants that are associated with higher risk of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity can contribute towards developing a predictive algorithm comprising both clinical and genetic factors to select patients who should avoid treatment with anthracyclines. Hypothesis of this study is certain functional variants in genes that encode for metabolizing enzymes and/or targets in the doxorubicin pharmacology pathway may increase the risk of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy    ,NCT02078388
Breast Cancer,A Prospective Pilot Study to Evaluate the Effect of Systemic Adjuvant Therapy on the Cognitive and Brain Function of Breast Cancer Patients, The purpose of the study is to examine cognitive and brain function in stage I-III breast cancer patients who have undergone adjuvant systemic therapy (chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus anti-hormonal therapy) in comparison to a group of healthy controls. Our hypothesis is that systemic adjuvant therapy in the form of chemotherapy or chemotherapy and anti-hormonal therapy given to primary breast cancer patients can cause cognitive impairment. We hypothesize that the use of simultaneous PET/MRI will allow us to determine key regions in the brain that show metabolic structural and functional deficits in a semi-quantitative manner and reveal subtle changes that are often missed during neuropsychological tests due to the low sensitivity of neuropsychological batteries.    ,NCT02078531

Breast Cancer,Study Assessing the Potential for Reduced Rates of Implant Failure Using Multi-Beam Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy for Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Patients With Implant Reconstructions," The purpose of this study is to determine if a radiation treatment called ""Multi-beam Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy""(IMRT) can reduce side effects related to your implant if they are a candidate for radiation therapy. Currently the standard method of giving radiation is with ""3D radiation"" which only uses 2-5 beams of radiation. ""Multi-beam"" IMRT works by using 8-12 small radiation beams to give a more ""tailored"" or ""customized"" radiation dose to the implant breast chest wall and lymph nodes. At the same time multi-beam IMRT may lower the radiation dose to the heart lung and nearby tissues. The goal of the study is to reduce complications after irradiation to the implants. The study doctors have recently completed a trial using this technique and are now specifically looking at its impact on women with implant reconstructions who are undergoing post-mastectomy radiation therapy. By delivering a more ""customized"" dose of radiation to the implant the intent is to reduce side effects of radiation on the implant.    ",NCT02086578
Breast Cancer,Study of LEE011 With Fulvestrant and BYL719 or BKM120 in Advanced Breast Cancer, The purpose of this trial is to explore the clinical utility of the three investigational agents in HR+ HER2- breast cancer. LEE011 (CDK4/6 inhibitor) BKM120 (PI3K-pan class I-inhibitor) and BYL719 (PI3K-alpha specific class I inhibitor) in combination with fulvestrant. This is a multi-center open-label Phase Ib/II study.

Breast Cancer,Trial of Superiority of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Patients With Breast Cancer," The previous reported phase I study allows us to prospectively define the optimal total dose in different metastatic locations (88). However several questions are still unanswered such as the adequate timing of the stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in oligometastatic disease. Indeed there are two different oligometastatic states: ""de novo"" i.e. occurring at first metastatic presentation without any previous systemic therapy; and ""secondary"" defined as residual disease after systemic treatment. The investigators wish to prospectively study the role of metastases SBRT with curative intent in de novo oligometastatic disease. This clinical trial would be the first randomized study studying SBRT at onset of the metastatic disease. If this trial shows a PFS improvement it will definitively change the standard of treatment and it will highlight SBRT as a key treatment of metastatic disease. It will confirm the oligometastasis hypothesis as well as the Simon Norton hypothesis (92).    ",NCT02089100

Breast Cancer,GCC 1366: Anti-Proliferative Response to NeoAdjuvant AIs in Overweight and Obese Patients, More than three quarter of patients with breast cancer are treated by hormone pills called tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). AIs are drugs that stop female hormone production. This hormone production mostly happens in fat muscle and breast tissue in postmenopausal women. The female hormone estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast cancer cells. Anastrozole (Arimidex®) and Letrozole (Femara®) are AIs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They have been used since 2005 to treat women with early stage breast cancer. When given before surgery (neoadjuvant) both anastrozole and letrozole have been shown to successfully shrink breast cancer tumors in most patients. In over 50% of patients anastrozole and letrozole when given for about 4 months also helped to improve surgery outcomes. On top of that whether or not a patient responds to anastrozole and letrozole before surgery can help the doctor decide whether that patient needs additional chemotherapy. One of the things may influence the level of hormone is body weight. It has been previously shown that postmenopausal women with higher body fat have higher level of female hormone as well as an increased risk of breast cancer. This is likely due to an increase in aromatase activity in the fatty tissue. However at the current time AIs are used at the same doses in all women with breast cancer no matter whether they have different body weight. Currently we do not know for certain whether the same doses of AIs work as well in patients with higher body fat compared to patients with less body fat. The purpose of this study is to see if women with higher body fat respond differently to AI treatment compared to women with lower body fat.    ,NCT02095184
Breast Cancer,Is Any Additional Information Gained Regarding Margins Using 3D Tomosynthesis Vs 2D Conventional Digital Imaging When Imaging Operative Breast Specimens?, Patients who are diagnosed with breast cancer will have surgery to remove the tumour. Where this is a local excision not mastectomy the tissue removed is sent for x-ray imaging to assess that the abnormality has been removed and give an estimation of the distance from lesion to specimen edge. This allows the surgeon to decide whether to remove more tissue or not at the time. This study is designed to compare whether more accurate information about lesion to margin measurement can be obtained using 3 dimensional tomosynthesis imaging compared to 2 dimensional conventional digital imaging which is the type of imaging currently used. This has the potential to prevent some patients requiring a second operation to remove more tissue if the margins of the specimen are still involved with tumour. The study involves x-raying the specimen under both conditions when it arrives from theatre. Only the 2D image will be reviewed at the time as is current practice. The 3D image will be reviewed later and the measurements for lesion to specimen margin compared. The lesion to margin measurement as recorded by the pathologist will be taken as the 'gold standard' and the imaging measurements will also be compared to that. In theory the use of 3D tomosynthesis should allow more accurate lesion to margin measurement because 3D can provide better visualisation of the lesion edges by removing the effect of superimposed tissue. The hypothesis states that the use of 3 dimensional tomosynthesis imaging should provide better lesion visualisation compared to 2 dimensional conventional digital imaging thus allowing more accurate lesion to margin measurement.    ,NCT02096185
Breast Cancer,Detection and Prevention of Anthracycline-Related Cardiac Toxicity With Concurrent Simvastatin, Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) one of the drugs commonly used for the treatment of breast cancer is in a class of medications called anthracyclines. Anthracyclines may cause heart damage that can lead to weakening of the heart muscle. This heart damage may happen right away or may occur many years after the anthracycline is given. Simvastatin is an oral medication approved by the FDA to lower cholesterol. Simvastatin is in a class of medications called statins. Some research has shown that statins may prevent heart damage that can be caused by anthracyclines like Doxorubicin (Adriamycin). The purpose of this study is to determine if taking simvastatin while receiving the chemotherapy Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) will minimize damage to the heart. This study is for women who will be receiving the anthracycline doxorubicin (Adriamycin) as part of their breast cancer treatment.    ,NCT02096588
Breast Cancer,Prognostic Evaluation of Changing Endocrine Therapy in Women With Breast Cancer, It suggests in the Guideline that the postmenopausal women with breast cancer who have taken selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) therapy for 2-3 years could benefit from changing endocrine therapy to aromatase inhibitors (AIs). This is a prospective randomized and non-inferior trial to evaluate the prognosis of changing endocrine therapy from SERMs to AIs in perimenopausal and recently postmenopausal women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.    ,NCT02097459
Breast Cancer,Hand-held Gamma Camera in the SNOLL Procedure, In France breast cancer affects approximately 53000 new cases per year. The investigators have to take care more and more women with subclinical lesions (nonpalpable) and it represents around 25% to 35% of the diagnosed breast cancers. The main problem of the surgical management of these lesions is the quality of preoperative identification which determines the quality of surgery and oncological and cosmetic outcomes. For this type of lesion SNOLL (Sentinel Node and Occult Lesion Localization) procedure could be proposed. This is a radioactive labeling of the tumor site and sentinel lymph node (SLN). The investigators want to evaluate the potential benefits of using a hand held camera called TreCam in this SNOLL procedure. This camera permits to obtain nuclear imaging at the bedside and in the operating theater.    ,NCT02101320

Breast Cancer,Single Fraction Early Prostate Irradiation (SiFEPI), Recently HDR brachytherapy delivering only a 19 Gy fraction was proposed as exclusive treatment for low and intermediate risk prostate cancers. With a median 3-year follow-up the Spanish team reported a biochemical control rate of 100% and 87% respectively for low risk and intermediate risk tumors. In parallel with these encouraging results regarding biochemical control the authors described excellent urinary and digestive tolerance notably the absence of grade > 2 complications. However it should be noted in this study that special protection was provided to the anterior aspect of the rectum by means of a 10 ml transperineal injection of hyaluronic acid into the prostate-rectal interspace. The idea of using a single high dose (in one fraction) was proposed at the MSKCC by the team of Fucks et al. which in 2008 following a median 18-month follow-up published a a 90% local control rate for spinal metastases after a single dose at 18 to 24 Gy. The aim of the present study is to analyze acute urinary and digestive toxicity (< 180 days) observed following interstitial high dose rate prostate brachytherapy delivering a total dose of 20 Gy in one fraction.    ,NCT02104362

Breast Cancer,Effects of a Structured Exercise Program on Cancer-Related Fatigue in Women Receiving Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer, Radiation therapy (RT) is often used to treat breast cancer. RT combined with breast surgery is associated with better outcomes in early stage breast cancer compared to surgery alone. Fatigue is one of the most important side effects of RT because it can decrease patients' quality of life. Studies found that physical activity (PA) may help to improve quality of life in cancer survivors. PA has been reported to lower fatigue anxiety and depression. Physical inactivity over a long period of time may lead to rapid energy and physical function loss. PA intervention studies in patients undergoing RT have included mostly White patients. There is no evidence on African American patients undergoing RT. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a structured moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program in reducing cancer-related fatigue in African Americans undergoing RT for localized breast cancer.    ,NCT02117011
Breast Cancer,Observational Study to Evaluate Mechanisms of Aromatase Inhibitor Associated Musculoskeletal Symptoms, Early stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer is typically treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy in order to decrease risk of breast cancer recurrence and to improve overall survival from the disease. Typical agents used for treatment include tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors. In postmenopausal women aromatase inhibitor therapy is increasingly common because it is associated with fewer long-term serious toxicities compared to tamoxifen. However aromatase inhibitors cause arthralgias in 40-50% of patients which can influence adherence to therapy and can lead to treatment discontinuation in a minority of cases. The mechanism underlying development of this toxicity remains unclear and predictors of who will develop these symptoms remain undefined. This observational study is designed to collect patient-reported outcomes and serial serum samples in order to investigate potential etiologies of this bothersome toxicity.    ,NCT02118636

Breast Cancer,The Effect of an Inter-Disciplinary Program Including MBSR in Breast Cancer Survivors With Chronic Neuropathic Pain, Chronic neuropathic pain is a common problem for breast cancer survivors. Even with the best medical treatment some survivors continue to experience disabling pain. It is well-established that an interdisciplinary approach is key to the treatment of some types of chronic pain but little research has been done on the effectiveness of interdisciplinary treatments for cancer survivors with chronic neuropathic pain. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary approach combining medical treatment and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to reduce disability and improve quality of life among breast cancer survivors with chronic neuropathic pain. The investigators will also evaluate the impact of the program on psychological distress pain cognitions biomarkers of stress and immune function cognitive function as well as brain structure and function. The investigators will recruit 108 adult women survivors of breast cancer living with chronic neuropathic pain. All will have their medical treatment optimized by a pain medicine specialist before being randomly assigned to either an 8-week group MBSR program or a wait-list. All participants will complete self-report questionnaires provide a hair sample for cortisol measurements and a blood sample to measure several markers of immune function at four different time points: before medical treatment after medical treatment and before randomization to MBSR or waiting after the completion of MBSR as well as at 3-month follow-up. A sub-sample will complete a series of tasks while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after participation in MBSR. The primary outcome is pain interference. The investigators will compare the proportion of participants who report reduced pain-related disability as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory-Interference Scale in each group. The primary hypothesis is that at 3-month follow-up there will be at least 30% more responders (??.0 decrease in mean Brief Pain Inventory Interference score) in the interdisciplinary program in comparison to medical treatment alone.    ,NCT02125006

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Two Boost Radiation Schedules in Post Lumpectomy Early Stage Carcinoma Breast, In a general radiation oncology practice breast cancer typically comprises approximately 25% of the total patient caseload.1 Surgery is the primary modality of treatment. Radical mastectomy remained the mainstay of surgical therapy into the 1970s. Breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy to the intact breast is an established standard of care for the majority of women with early stage invasive breast cancer. Recommended techniques for breast-conservation treatment are local excision of the primary tumor preferably with clear margins axillary lymph node dissection and breast irradiation (45 to 50 Gy) usually with a boost (10 to 20 Gy depending on tumor size and status of the surgical margins). The aim of this study is to compare the two boost regimen 10Gy/5#/1 week with 16Gy/8#/1.5 weeks in post lumpectomy patients of early stage breast cancer following whole breast irradiation (WBI). The study will include 50 patients (25 in each arm) of early stage post lumpectomy breast cancer patients. Each patient will be treated by WBI followed by tumor bed boost with either electron beam therapy or 3D CRT. The primary end point of the study will be assessment of acute and late radiation toxicities cosmetic score analysis and local control between two schedules. Secondary end points will be recurrence-free survival.    ,NCT02142907
Breast Cancer,RTA 408 Lotion in Patients at Risk for Radiation Dermatitis - PRIMROSE, Radiation dermatitis is experienced by almost all patients (up to 95%) receiving radiation therapy for cancer. Radiation dermatitis can be a serious condition because in addition to its direct physical complications and the resulting impact on overall quality of life it can also be a dose-limiting toxicity requiring changes to the prescribed course of radiation therapy. The most common strategy employed in an attempt to prevent or minimize radiation dermatitis involves moisturization of the irradiated area use of a mild soap to keep the area clean and minimizing exposure to potential mechanical irritants such as scratching and rough clothing. However this strategy has been shown to lack clinically significant efficacy. Consequently there is a clinical need for new treatments that are effective in protecting against radiotherapy-induced oxidative stress and the subsequent development of radiation dermatitis. Based on data from previous studies in animals and humans Reata believes that omaveloxolone (RTA 408) Lotion may effectively prevent and mitigate radiation dermatitis in oncology patients undergoing radiation therapy. This randomized double-blind vehicle-controlled parallel-group trial will study the efficacy tolerability and safety of two concentrations of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) Lotion (3% and 0.5%) versus vehicle in patients with breast cancer for whom radiation therapy is recommended.    ,NCT02142959

Breast Cancer,Integrating Palliative Care Into Self-Management of Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to test a psycho-educational intervention Managing Cancer Care: A Personal Guide (MCC) that is intended to improve patients' knowledge of palliative care and to facilitate its timely integration into self-management of their breast cancer. The MCC will be tested with patients with Stage I-IV breast cancer at baseline one and three months following enrollment. The intervention group will receive the MCC and the attention-control group will receive a symptom management toolkit. Participants' family caregivers will also be enrolled to provide information on patients' self-management. Investigators hypothesize that users of MCC as compared to attention-control participants will demonstrate improved knowledge feelings and behaviors related to self-management of their cancer care. This innovative research can help to establish palliative care as a mainstay of self-management interventions that target serious illnesses.    ,NCT02148575
Breast Cancer,Exergaming Intervention and Breast Cancer Biomarkers in Black Women, Overview: This is a 6 month two-arm randomized clinical trial using comparing exergaming to a control group. The investigators will randomize Black sedentary overweight/obese women to Wii Fit exercise (n=50) or the control arm (n=50). Women in the Wii Fit exercise group will come to the Georgetown community-based exercise facility 3 days/wk. The control group will be asked to maintain their current daily activities and not to exercise for the duration of the study. Based on the investigators previous findings that women who engage in 75-150 mins/wk of brisk walking had an 18% decreased risk of breast cancer the investigators will target this level of activity in the investigators intervention arm. Also this 150 min/week of physical activity meets the current recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the US Department of Health and Human Services for healthy individuals and is in line with recommendation of the American Cancer Society (ACS) for cancer prevention.    ,NCT02152462

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Real Imaging's 3D Functional Metabolic Imaging and Risk Assessment (MIRA) System, Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging (3D MIRA) is a new infrared imaging technology using the Real Imager 8 (RI8) developed by Real Imaging. This technology generates 3D metabolic maps of the breast and based on sophisticated machine learning technology provides objective risk assessment for the presence of malignant tumor in the breast. The procedure is non-invasive comfortable and does not involve ionizing radiation. It is based on acquiring infrared images of the breast. Those images are processed and analyzed by computers to provide the objective risk assessment. The technology is intended to be used as a screening tool for breast cancer and emerges as highly useful in women for whom screening mammography is sub-optimal such as women with dense breast. 3D MIRA is unaffected by breast density and is therefore ideal for evaluating patients with mammographically dense breasts. The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the ability of this novel technology to detect breast cancer in women.    ,NCT02155075

Breast Cancer,Shoulder Disability and Late Symptoms Following Oncoplastic Breast Surgery, Breast cancer affects a large proportion of Danish women and late morbidity following breast cancer treatment including pain reduced motility and force of the arm and shoulder disturbed sensitivity and lymph edema affects many patients. The risk for such late complications have previously been carefully described by us and others in patients operated by traditional methods but the follow-up in most of these studies have been rather short  and long time follow-up results are not available. The impact of the new oncoplastic techniques that allows more women to have breast conserving surgery is not known yet. These operations are more extensive and therefore might be accompanied by more complications. The purpose of this study is to give answer to that question.The study includes three parts. First a questionnaire to patients who have breast conserving surgery performed in one of the three breast units in Central Region Denmark. It contains questions regarding arm morbidity quality of life comorbidity and body image. The questionnaire should be filled in preoperatively and 18 months after surgery. The second part consists of an objective evaluation of shoulder and arm function and cosmesis before and after breast conserving surgery with and without oncoplastic techniques. This should be performed at baseline before surgery and 18 months later. The third part is a long time follow-up of patients after breast conserving surgery without oncoplastic techniques. This group of patients is recruited from three breast units in Central Region Denmark. It contains questions regarding arm morbidity quality of life comorbidity and body image. The questionnaire should be filled in preoperatively and 18 months after surgery. The second part consists of an objective evaluation of shoulder and arm function and cosmesis before and after breast conserving surgery with and without oncoplastic techniques. This should be performed at baseline before surgery and 18 months later. The third part is a long time follow-up of patients after breast conserving surgery without oncoplastic techniques. This group of patients is recruited from the cohort in a previous study with 18 months follow-up following breast conserving surgery without oncoplastic technique.    ,NCT02159274

Breast Cancer,Diagnosis and Management of Myofascial Pain Syndrome in Women With Mastectomies, Myofascial pain considerably affects women undergoing treatment for breast cancer is characterized by the presence of myofascial taut bands and trigger points. This study aims to evaluate the effects of ischemic compression high-voltage electrical stimulation and rehabilitation of kinesio in women with myofascial pain following treatment of breast cancer. This is a randomized blind controlled study. For this we invited 60 volunteers undergoing treatment for breast cancer randomized and allocated into three groups: G1 (cinesioterapia) G2 (ischemic compression cinesioterapia +) and G3 (high voltage electrical stimulation cinesioterapia +). The stance the plantar pressure distribution and the balance will be assessed by means of photogrammetry and baropodometry respectively. Myofascial trigger points will be assessed with the use of infrared thermography algometry and numerical rating scale of pain (END). Moreover the quality of life of the volunteers will be assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B +4). The volunteers will undergo 10 sessions of treatment and reassessed at the end of treatment and after thirty days. Normality test is used to verify data distribution and consistent statistical test for proper intra and comparisons between groups being thus considered two factors in the comparisons time and group. A significance level of 5% is assumed.    ,NCT02181166

Breast Cancer,Bevacizumab Etoposide and Cisplatin Followed by Whole Brain Radiotherapy in Breast Cancer With Brain Metastases, The primary objective of A-PLUS trial is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of induction BEEP (bevacizumab preconditioning followed by etoposide and cisplatin) followed by whole bran radiotherapy (WBRT) with WBRT alone in the controlling of brain metastases (BM) in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients who have not previously received WBRT. In past 2 years the research team has demonstrated that BEEP regimen is a highly effective treatment for brain metastases of breast cancer progressing from WBRT by a multi-center phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01281696). The basic concept of preconditioning as referred to starting bevacizumab 1 day before chemotherapy is that the effect of bevacizumab induced tumor vascular normalization takes time to mature. The investigators hypothesized that as induction BEEP decreased the size of brain tumors the effectiveness of WBRT would be maximized. The investigators expect this integrated approach will do greater benefit to MBC patients with BM irrespective of subtype.    ,NCT02185352
Breast Cancer,Effect of Perioperative Intravenous Lidocaine Infusion and Magnesium Infusion on the Functional Recovery After General Anesthesia in the Patients Undergoing Breast Mastectomy, Postsurgical pain is a relevant side effect following surgery which increases the risk of various complications and delays postoperative patient recovery. Among the many types of surgeries mastectomy causes not only acute but also chronic pain in many patients. Therefore it is important to control pain and increase patients' recovery satisfaction following many kinds of operations by using as small an opioid analgesic dose as possible and adding a nonopioid analgesic to reduce the side effects of narcotic analgesics. Among nonopioid analgesics lidocaine and magnesium are drawing attention having been shown to be helpful in controlling postoperative pain by lowering pain hypersensitivity to surgical stimuli. An intraoperative intravenous injection of lidocaine has been reported to improve postoperative pain control by reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Another report showed that an intraoperative intravenous injection of lidocaine improved the quality of postoperative functional recovery after general anesthesia in a laparoscopic cholecystectomy patient. In addition a review article on the effect of intraoperative intravenous injection of magnesium found it to be an effective analgesic that may be added to conventional opioid-based therapy because it generally reduces opioid consumption decreases pain assessment for 24 hours after surgery and lacks severe side effects in relation to magnesium administration. However there has been insufficient research comparing the intraoperative intravenous injection of lidocaine or magnesium in terms of which is more helpful for general functional recovery and decreased postoperative pain. Recently the scope of research on anesthesia has come to embrace postanesthetic recovery; to help patients return to daily life the research trend is now shifting from the improvement or resolution of a specific symptom to the measurement of general recovery. A widely used method to measure postoperative recovery is the Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR-40) survey. Therefore in this study the researchers investigated the intraoperative intravenous injection of lidocaine and the intravenous injection of magnesium to compare these drugs' helpfulness in the functional recovery of mastectomy patients after general anesthesia.    ,NCT02185859
Breast Cancer,A Study to See Whether Adding Night-time Compression to the Standard Care Will Result in Improved Control of Arm Swelling (Lymphedema) in Breast Cancer Subjects, Lymphedema (significant arm swelling on the surgical side) is one of the most common complications following treatment for breast cancer. The impact of lymphedema is profound resulting in negative self image increased anxiety and poorer quality of life. In time lymphedema can result in recurrent infections in the arm functional impairment and pain. Approximately 21% of women who undergo breast cancer treatment develop lymphedema. Unfortunately this is a life-time condition which tends to worsen over time. Currently treatment consists of intensive physiotherapy meant to reduce the arm volume followed by the wearing of compression sleeves during the day for maintenance. This study hopes to show that the addition of night-time compression creates a measurable reduction in arm volume and that adding night-time compression to the standard care (daytime compression only) will produce improvements in quality of life for breast cancer survivors.    ,NCT02187289
Breast Cancer,Study to Compare Alisertib With Paclitaxel vs. Paclitaxel Alone in Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer, The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug alisertib in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel) can shrink or slow tumor growth in women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive HER2-negative or HR-negative HER2-negative (triple negative) locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The safety of alisertib in combination with paclitaxel will also be studied. The physical state of the patient symptoms changes in the size of the tumor and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research team decide if alisertib plus paclitaxel is safe and effective in patients with this type of breast cancer. Alisertib belongs to a group of drugs called Aurora kinase inhibitors. Alisertib blocks the activity of Aurora A kinase a protein that is involved in tumor cell multiplication and survival. Aurora A kinase is expressed at higher than normal levels in many types of cancer including breast cancer and preclinical studies suggest that blocking the activity of this protein can lead to the death of cancer cells. Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat many different kinds of cancer including metastatic breast cancer. The reason to combine alisertib and paclitaxel is that in cancer therapy combinations of drugs are often more effective as a treatment than either of the same drugs used alone.    ,NCT02187991
Breast Cancer,Improving Adherence to Recommended Surveillance in Breast Cancer Survivors, Evidence-based guidelines recommend cancer surveillance procedures for breast cancer survivors including physical examination mammography breast self-exam and gynecologic follow-up.

Breast Cancer,Preoperative and Intraoperative Quantification of Axillary Tumoral Load, At present patients diagnosed of a breast cancer with infiltration of the axillary lymph-nodes are submitted to axillary lymph-node dissection (ALND). The sentinel node (SN) technique is not indicated when a lymph-node biopsy or cytology is positive nor when the surgical treatment is upfront neither when a neoadjuvant systemic therapy is indicated. The reason for not performing SN is that patients diagnosed of an infiltrated axilla though ultrasound-guided biopsy or cytology tend to have a higher tumoral load than those diagnosed after a sentinel biopsy. Furthermore even if these patients are submitted to a neoadjuvant systemic treatment and the axillary clinical exploration is negative after the treatment different studies showed that the SN false negative rate is unacceptably high. Despite these facts a high proportion of patients with a positive axilla at diagnosis and submitted to level I and II axillary lymph node dissection show few lymph nodes infiltrated in the pathological study frequently four or less neoplastic nodes. New methods of detecting these patients with limited infiltrated nodes should be developed and new approaches to axillary surgery (i.e. partial resection) should be offered. To date the only information expected to get after an axillary imaging is performed is if the axilla is infiltrated or not. No information about the tumoral load is demanded. In the other hand level I and II ALND is performed according to established anatomic limits without selecting the nodes to be excised neither identifying the ones infiltrated for a directed excision. The aim of the study is to evaluate the ability of a specified and reproducible imaging protocol for distinguishing patients with a high axillary tumoral load from the ones with a low tumoral load. At the same time as the initial nodes receiving lymph drainage should be the ones commonly affected identifying these nodes injecting diluted methylene blue in the retroareolar parenchyma and studying their tumoral load could help selecting patients with high from those with low axillary tumoral load. Evaluation of both steps (that is first the imaging protocol followed by the methylene blue protocol) could eventually help to distinguish which patients should be submitted to a classical level I and II ALND and which ones can be spared from excising the lymph nodes not stained by the methylene blue.    ,NCT02197949

Breast Cancer,Single Versus Double Drains After Mastectomy, It is not known whether decreasing the number of drains used decreases patients' discomfort and duration of hospital stay without increasing seroma formation after mastectomies. Hypothesis. Use of one drain increases patient comfort without increasing seroma formation after modified radical mastectomy (MRM) as compared to double drains. Material and Method: Sixty patients undergoing MRM at Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital will be randomised into single versus double drains groups. A negative pressure drain will be inserted below the lower flap directing to the axilla in the single drain group or two similar drains will be inserted into the axilla and below the lower flap in the double drains group. Drains will be removed if the output is less than 30 ml. Seroma is defined as fluid accumulation below the flaps and will be examined daily after the operation. One day after removal of the drains seroma under the flaps and in the axilla will be examined by ultrasonography. Age body mass index smoking history coexisting diseases of the patients duration of the hospital stay duration of the drains in place total drain output in the first three days after the operation and the need and frequency of aspirations due to seroma formation will be recorded.

Breast Cancer,Endocrine Response in Women With Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer," RATIONALE: Currently adjuvant endocrine therapy often follows a ""one-size-fits- all"" approach with most premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen and most postmenopausal receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy. In current clinical practice patients with invasive lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer subtype. PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy. Primary Objective: To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1) anastrozole (1mg given orally daily) or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).

Breast Cancer,Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy. Could Physical Therapy Help Treat Symptoms?, The cause of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) is still unknown. A theory is that the microtubule-stabilizing agents that prevent division of cells also affect healthy peripheral nerves. Symptoms of CIPN are in the hands/feet and include: pain numbness and loss of function. An estimated 55-60% of patients will experience lasting symptoms affecting function for years post-treatment. Research on nerve disorders identifies that a nerve already entrapped/damaged at one site may be at greater risk when combined with chemotherapy (double crush syndrome). Physical therapy is an established effective treatment for entrapped nerves and neuropathic pain. This study seeks to identify additional risk factors and provide evidence for the role of physical therapy in the treatment of CIPN. Hypotheses   1. Physical therapy will assist in managing symptoms (sensory pain edema) compared to the control group during chemotherapy.   2. Positive tests for mechanical entrapment prior to chemotherapy will result in more severe symptoms of CIPN.   3. The treatment group will have greater resolution of CIPN symptoms compared to control at the six month follow-up.    ,NCT02239601
Breast Cancer,Sentinel Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: Omission of Axillary Clearance After Macrometastases. A Randomized Trial., Since the introduction of sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer it has become clear that its use is reliable and reproducible. Today it is clinical routine to not remove further lymph nodes from the axilla (arm pit) in case the sentinel node (which is the first lymph node/s reached by lymphatic flow from the breast) is free of tumor deposits. It is also routine to leave remaining lymph nodes behind in case the sentinel node contains a minimal cluster of tumor cells called isolated tumor cells (formerly submicrometastasis). Even in slightly larger tumor deposits so called micrometastasis (up to 2 mm in size) it has been shown that a completion axillary clearance (removal of further lymph nodes from the arm pit) does not contribute to a better survival. Data from a randomized study indicate that it seems safe to omit axillary clearance even if the sentinel node biopsy shows up to 2 nodes with tumor deposits over 2 mm in size (macrometastasis). These studies have changed clinical practice in many countries however it is still debated whether it is safe to omit axillary clearance in the case of sentinel node macrometastasis due to under-recruitment in the aforementioned study. The rationale for omitting extensive axillary surgery is the avoidance of postoperative morbidity such as arm lymphedema loss of sensation pain and swelling. The hypothesis is that refraining from axillary clearance in breast cancer patients with 1-2 sentinel nodes with macrometastasis will not worsen breast cancer-specific survival by more than a maximum of 2.5% after 5 years. This study is a prospective multicenter randomized trial including the majority of centers in Sweden treating breast cancer. Planned accrual is 3700 patients. Breast cancer patients without signs of axillary nodal involvement will be eligible for sentinel node biopsy. Those who are found to have up to two sentinel node containing macrometastasis will be informed about this trial Those wishing to participate will be randomized to either undergo further axillary surgery (clearance) or not. Outcome measures are breast cancer-specific survival disease-free survival axillary recurrence rate and overall survival.    ,NCT02240472
Breast Cancer,FAST MRI Study in Breast Cancer Survivors, Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been shown to be the most accurate test for detecting breast cancer however MRI is not always reliable because it can indicate the presence of cancer when in reality there is none; this is called a 'false positive' result. A history of breast carcinoma alone does not qualify a patient for ongoing monitoring with breast MRI. This study is being done to assess a new technique called FAST breast MRI. A FAST breast MRI is different than a traditional breast MRI because it has much fewer sequences and takes approximately 3 minutes for the scan. MRI sequences are combinations of magnetic pulses that collect information about the tissues. There is no radiation associated with an MRI. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact on patient health when a FAST breast MRI is used as a screening technique in women with a personal history of cancer. It has been shown that FAST breast MRI is similar to routine breast MRI in the detection of breast cancer but it has not been proven that FAST breast MRI will help women who have a personal history for breast cancer. Currently routine breast MRI is not part of the standard of care in screening for breast cancer in women who have a prior personal history of breast cancer. By evaluating FAST MRI the investigators are able to study the effects of this short MRI on cancer detection in women with a personal history of breast cancer and on the impact on overall health. The investigators estimate that 300 participants will be enrolled in the study from The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre at The Ottawa Hospital General Campus and the Women's Breast Health Centre at The Ottawa Hospital Civic Campus. All of the participants have had a history of breast carcinoma.    ,NCT02244593

Breast Cancer,Study of Concurrent Paclitaxel and Radiation: Correlation of Tumor Profiles With Pathologic Response, The need to understand LABC is especially compelling in populations and countries with limited resources where breast cancer incidence is relatively low but mortality is comparably high. In these settings access to appropriate cancer care is characteristically limited or often plainly nonexistent. In contrast to economically developed nations where on average fewer than 20% of women present with breast cancer at advanced stages LABC and metastatic disease are the most common stages at presentation in 50% or more women in Latin America Asia and Africa.    ,NCT02280252
Breast Cancer,Adjuvant Radiotherapy in Breast With Intensity Modulated by Tomotherapy:, Adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy allows a local long-term control of the order 85 to 95% with a survival rate equivalent to that of the totally mastectomy. The diminution of the local recurrence rate after irradiation post- lumpectomy is also associated to a best global survival than only the surgery. The adjuvant radiotherapy after partially or totally mastectomy for the progressive tumors is a therapeutic standard (Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group 2011). The aim of our trial of routine care is to record our practices under this breast adjuvant radiotherapy.    ,NCT02281149
Breast Cancer,Radiofrequency Ablation in Breast Cancer," Background/Main objective: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive procedure widespread accepted in the treatment of different tumors especially in the liver but its benefit is not yet well-known in breast cancer. Our main objective is to evaluate the usefulness of RFA in < 2cm malignant breast tumors to reduce the proportion of positive margins. Methodology: The investigator propose a single-center single-blind phase I and II randomized controlled trial. Phase I:Security of the cool-tip cluster electrode assessing the potential adverse effects in three stages: initialintermediate and final. Phase II: Randomized clinical trial 2 parallel groups with 37 patients in each one. Experimental group: percutaneous RFA previous to conventional lumpectomy. Control group: conventional surgery with lumpectomy. The number of positive margins in both groups and the need of extending margin resection will be assessed intraoperatively. Inclusion criteria: women >40 years infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma by biopsy. The tumor must be unique visible by ultrasound smaller than 2cm and located > 1 cm from the chest wall and the skin. Patients will be followed up for a period of two years to assess cosmetic result short -term and long -term complications and recurrences. Expected results: The ""cool-tip"" (cluster) ablation method reduces by at least 30% the risk of intraoperative extensions for positive margins during lumpectomy compared to conventional surgery in breast tumors with a diameter < 2 cm. Therefore this procedure may reduce the risk of second surgeries and the removed volume of tissue.Consequently the final cosmetic result should be improved.    ",NCT02281812

Breast Cancer,TARGIT-C(Consolidation) Prospective Phase IV Study of IORT in Patients With Small Breast Cancer, This prospective multicentric single arm phase IV study is based on the protocol of the international TARGIT-A and TARGIT-E study. Patients ??50 years with small low-risk breast cancer who are operated but not irradiated show local relapse rates around 6% after 5 years. With adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) the local relapse rate drops to under 1% after 5 years under Tamoxifen (4). It has been demonstrated (6 9 10) that the efficacy of radiation of the tumor bed only in a selected group can be non-inferior to WBRT. The TARGIT C study should confirm the efficacy of a single dose of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in a well selected group of patients with small breast cancer and absence of risk factors. In presence of risk factors postoperative WBRT will be added to complete the radiotherapeutic treatment according to international guidelines. Endpoints are the local relapse rate (within 2 cm of the tumor bed) ipsilateral relapse cancer-specific and overall survival and contralateral breast cancer as well as documentation of quality of life and cosmetic outcome. The expected local relapse rates are 0.825/1.375% after 3/5 years respectively. Discontinuation of the trial is scheduled if rates of local relapse rates rise to 1.55/2.4/4% after 1/3/5 years. Power calculations result in 387 patients with a calculated dropout and loss to follow-up rate of 10% an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.10. There will be only a pre-pathology stratum. It is a pragmatic trial in which each participating centre has the option to modify entry criteria and criteria for WBRT according to this core protocol after consultation with the steering committee and local ethics committee (e.g. size free margins). Only centers with access to the Intrabeam® system (Carl Zeiss) can recruit patients into the trial.    ,NCT02290782

Breast Cancer,Evidence Based Dissemination for Mammography Adherence in Safety Net Communities, Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related death in American women. Regular screening early diagnosis and timely treatment initiation have been shown to reduce breast cancer morbidity and mortality. However disparities continue to exist across the breast cancer continuum for underserved women particularly minority women. The reduction of disparities in breast cancer outcomes is a major goal of Healthy People 2020 and the National Cancer Institute. However the preventable burden of late stage breast cancer will continue until the investigators close the gap between what is known about prevention and what is implemented in the community. Although many sources of information exist about theory and [theory-] and evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to promote mammography screening their adoption and use in the community has been limited and haphazard at best.    ,NCT02296177

Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer Survivorship & Work-Related Cognitive Limitation, The proposed study seeks to evaluate the relationship between biopsychosocial functioning and work-related cognitive limitation among employed breast cancer survivors in a cross-sectional study with healthy control group. Specifically this study will assess work-related cognitive limitation in association with depression anxiety pain fatigue sleep disturbance and cognitive deficit of employed women with and without history of breast cancer. The primary purpose of this study is to assess the impact of objective cognitive functioning as a better predictor of cognitive shortcomings at work place in comparison to a self-report cognitive measure. The secondary purpose is to assess work related cognitive limitation in breast cancer survivors in comparison to their counterparts (employed women without history of cancer diagnosis). The third purpose is to explore how sociodemographic variables such as marital status education age race and ethnicity relates to perceived cognitive limitation at work among breast cancer survivors. Additionally the study will examine the effects of medical variables as covariates on these relationships. Subsequently the study will examine the level of mindful attention and awareness as a possible mediator between the psychological somatic and cognitive distress and the work-related cognitive limitation. In this observational study the control group is added as a mean to compare differences between groups and that no variables is being manipulated in this study. This precludes this research from being a quasi- or a true experimental design.    ,NCT02303145

Breast Cancer,Impact of a Surgical Sealing Patch on Lymphatic Drainage After ALND for Breast Cancer, Axillary lymph node dissection remains an integral part of surgical treatment of primarily node-positive invasive breast cancer. In order to reduce the incidence of clinically relevant seroma a suction drain is routinely placed into the axillary cavity after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) by a separate stab incision. The pathogenesis of seroma involves the collection of lymph fluid caused by dissection of lymph vessels and exudate. All coagulation and fibrinolytic factors are produced and secreted by lymphatic endothelial cells and are involved in the sealing of lymphatic capillaries. Local hemostyptic agents may therefore reduce postoperative secretion from lymphatic fistulas caused by ALND. We propose to conduct a multicenter prospective randomized control trial in Switzerland to evaluate the impact of TachoSil® a ready-to-use absorbable surgical patch (consisting of an equine collagen sponge coated with human fibrinogen and human thrombin) on axillary drainage after ALND for breast cancer. We hypothesize that the use of TachoSil® significantly and relevantly reduces the volume and duration of axillary drainage after ALND. This has the potential to increase patients' quality of life as well as to shorten the length of hospital stay and reduce hospital costs.    ,NCT02311543
Breast Cancer,Therapeutic Nipple Sparing Mastectomy., This is a phase III multicentric single arm study with a sequential design using the exact conditional Poisson test. The primary objective of this prospective study is to evaluate whether selected breast carcinoma patients could be treated with nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM) with an acceptable low local recurrence rates. 450 patients will be included over a period of 4 years and will be followed for a 5 years period (twice a year). All patients must have a complete preoperative evaluation (bilateral mammography bilateral breast ultrasonography +/- MRI) and a histopathological diagnostic proof of carcinoma (invasive or in situ all histopathological types first treatment or relapse). The study procedure is represented by nipple areola skin-sparing mastectomy followed by immediate breast reconstruction. After surgery early and late complications including specific complications (suffering of the nipple-areolar complexe and suffering of the skin flaps) will be evaluate. An esthetic evaluation (by patient and clinician) and a quality of life evaluation will be realized throughout the study. A complementary study prospective non-interventional will be proposed to patients who will benefit from the same surgical technique (NSM) followed by immediate reconstruction but in the context of preventive surgery (prophylactic surgery for patients mutated or high genetic risk). The aim of this complementary study which will include a maximum of 60 patients is to evaluate associated morbidity in prophylactic NSM. Data will be collected over a 3 months period after surgery.    ,NCT02311959

Breast Cancer,Fluorescence Imaging in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Breast Cancer and Melanoma, The NIR light source of our device is based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs) which can deliver sufficient light to biological tissues and induce fluorescence emission to meet the needs of the planned clinical studies. It should be noted that the light source is still well under the US FDA recommended limit for NIR exposure and ANSI standard. In addition the light source is not laser-based which is significantly safer than other optical imaging systems utilizing laser technologies. The fluorescence signals will be received by the detector portion of our device. Gain-settings could be easily adjusted during operation to optimize the contrast between high fluorescence areas (tumors) and low fluorescence areas (normal tissues). Real-time fluorescence video will be displayed in the goggle eyepiece as well as on a secondary monitor to facilitate viewing by other surgeons in the room.    ,NCT02316795
Breast Cancer,Amyloid Plaque Deposition in Chemotherapy-Induced Cognitive Impairment, The initial goal of the investigators interdisciplinary group of imagers oncologists neurologists neuro-psychologists and biostatisticians is to obtain proof of concept pilot data for eventual submission of a National Cancer Institute Quick-Trial for Imaging and Image-Guided Interventions: Exploratory Grant (R10) depending on the results of this pilot study. The overall objective is to use [18F]Flutemetamol FDG-PET and MRI to better understand CICI which effects up to 16 -50% of individuals receiving long-term adjuvant chemotherapy.23 To date there have been few studies examining this problem using multi-modality imaging techniques to better understand this complex and significant problem. FDG-PET and MRI are routinely used in clinical practice for the evaluation of cognitive dysfunction in older populations complaining of memory dysfunction. It is well recognized that FDG-PET can assist with the differentiation and characterization of various cognitive disorders due to unique patterns of cerebral metabolism caused by various cognitive and dementia-causing disorders.4-6 FDG-PET has been studied extensively in dementia research and has a high reliability in detecting Alzheimers disease (AD) many years before it can be diagnosed reliably using clinical criteria.4 To the investigators knowledge there has been only a single small study using FDG-PET and bolus water activation paradigms in cancer patients complaining of memory problems.7 To date there have been no studies using Flutemetamol as a PET imaging agent to assess the possibility of increased amyloid plaque burden as a potential contributing factor to the cognitive deficits and complaints seen in patients experiencing CICI. The novel feature of this project is in the combined use of Flutemetamol-PET FDG-PET and anatomic MRI to study a poorly understood but common problem: cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. If Flutemetamol FDG-PET and MRI can provide information on the pathophysiology of this disorder it will be an important step in better understanding the etiology of this phenomenon and possibly other conditions resulting in cognitive dysfunction. These imaging assessments will make it possible to explore any altered changes in cerebral structure metabolism and amyloid deposition that may be responsible for CICI. This may help to predict which individuals may be affected by this problem and provide information for eventual therapeutic strategies to treat this common cancer-associated disorder.

Breast Cancer,Initial Evaluation of Ultra FAST Breast Magnetic Resonance in Breast Cancer Screening: Comparative Study With Mammography and Ultrasound., Mammography remains an imperfect screening test especially in women with extremely dense breast tissue missing biologically aggressive cancers especially in younger population and picking up indolent cancers that do not need treatment. The most sensitive test for breast cancer detection at our disposal is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The preliminary study of Dr Kuhl provide strong arguments that Ultra FAST Breast Magnetic Resonance is suitable for breast cancer screening with high sensitivity and specificity values. Data clearly demonstrates that FAST breast MRI could be the standard for breast cancer screening: it is safe does not induce cancers and can find more cancers than mammography. However this study was performed in women with low to moderately increased risk.The value of FAST Breast Magnetic Resonance in normal screening population has to be assessed before a modification of current strategy of breast cancer screening with mammography.    ,NCT02324894

Breast Cancer,Age-related Changes in the Immune System and Their Impact on Elderly Breast Cancer, This research project aims to study this intriguing relationship between ageing and breast cancer biology and more specifically the changes that occur within the tumor microenvironment with increasing age. Furthermore it will focus on the link between these microenvironmental changes and organismal ageing (as measured by chronological age geriatric evaluation of elderly patients and circulating biomarkers of ageing) since it seems logical that age-related changes in the stromal part of a tumor (fibroblasts immune cells endothelial cells fatty cells ?i.e. host cells) are due to the ageing process of the entire body. Most particularly the amount and type of infiltrating immune cells might reflect the degree of immunosenescence of the host. More and more research points out the crucial role of the immune system in tumorigenesis and progression and at the same time the immune system is one of the most affected components in the process of ageing. .    ,NCT02327572

Breast Cancer,A Phase 2 Randomized Double-blind Trial Evaluating the Effects of Chloroquine in Breast Cancer," Chloroquine (CQ) is a well known well tolerated medication that has been used for many years traditionally for arthritis lupus and malaria. It has anti-inflammatory properties but is often the drug of choice for arthritis and malaria due to its few side effects. Recently laboratory investigations have proven that CQ may potentially have anti-cancer properties by inhibiting a process which allows cancers such as breast cancer to continue to grow (a process known as ""autophagy""). Therefore this study will look at how well CQ can inhibit the growth of breast cancers in patients while waiting for surgery.    ",NCT02333890

Breast Cancer,Pre-operative Zoledronate in Triple Negative Breast Cancer, Recent evidences suggest that zoledronate (zol) one of the most used bisphosphonates (BPs) in the clinical setting for the prevention and treatment of bone metastasis in cancer patients may have antitumor activity in early breast cancer in terms of improved disease free survival overall survival and better response in BPs treated patients. BPs are mevalonate pathway inhibitors and one of the most intriguing hypothesis supporting their anticancer activity relies on the modulation of the mevalonate downstream metabolism. Biologically active mevalonate metabolites are involved in tumour cell proliferation and invasion and selected cancer subtypes may present a more pronounced mevalonate activity able of maintaining an aggressive phenotype. The mevalonate pathway has deep impact on the function of YAP/TAZ transcriptional regulators of tumour growth and preclinical evidences suggest that BPs are able to interfere with YAP/TAZ expression via mevalonate pathway. This study addresses the clinical role of BPs in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients selected by the level of mevalonate pathway regulation namely the p53 expression. This study is a multicenter single-arm phase II study primarily aimed at assessing the anti-tumor activity of pre-operative zol measured through its effect on the Ki67 proliferative biomarker in TNBC patients classified according to the p53 expression (high vs low p53 expression). Patients with newly diagnosed untreated operable TNBC intended to definitive breast surgery and suitable for pre-operative therapy with zoledronate will receive a pre-operative single administration of zol (4mg i.v.) 7 days before definitive breast surgery. Ki67 levels will be assessed in tumor samples collected at the time of diagnosis and after zoledronate treatment at the time of definitive surgery. The secondary objective of the study is to investigate the effect of zoledronate on critical genes/proteins related to p53 and mevalonate pathways p53/PIN1 and YAP/TAZ analyzed in the tumor tissue collected at the time of diagnosis and at definitive surgery. Zol safety profile will be evaluated by the NCI-CTCAE scale version 4.0 and by the occurrence of serious adverse reactions. The total number of patients required is forty. The overall duration of the project is 32 months (30 months for accrual followed by 2 months of follow-up after the recruitment of the last patient).    ,NCT02347163

Breast Cancer,Oocyte Recovery During Tamoxifen Adjuvant Therapy, Survival in young patients with cancer has increased and also have increased the adverse long-term side effects of chemotherapy there is a large number of women who experience loss of ovarian function without accomplishing their reproductive desire due to gonadotoxic treatment. The ovarian reserve determine the response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in fertility preservation treatments as well as in assisted reproduction techniques. Improving this reserve by avoiding its depletion during the process could result in increase fertility rates after cancer treatment. Collecting follicles during tamoxifen treatment would increase the number of cryopreserved oocytes and thus rise the potential ovarian reserve in these patients which is reduced due to age chemotherapy and length of treatments. The aim of this study is to retrieve viable mature oocytes during adjuvancy with tamoxifen in breast cancer patients to improve the probability of subsequent pregnancy.    ,NCT02355600

Breast Cancer,Dose-confirmation Study of ASLAN001 Combined With Weekly Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Advanced Solid Tumours Followed by a Study in Patients With Stage I-III HER2 Positive Breast Cancer, The current standard of care for stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer is adjuvant chemotherapy combined with 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in early stage breast cancer has the advantages of i) tumour downsizing ii) higher breast conservation rates and iii) enabling the evaluation of tumour biology. Pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be an independent strong predictor of outcome in operable HER2-positive breast cancer. The addition of neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy to chemotherapy results in a 2-3 fold increase in pCR rates in operable HER2-positive breast cancer. However the optimal neoadjuvant regimen has not been defined in HER2-positive breast cancer. The investigators recently completed a phase II study of neoadjuvant lapatinib combined with weekly paclitaxel/ carboplatin in stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer. Preliminary analysis suggested that the utility of the regimen might have been limited by its unfavourable efficacy/ toxicity ratio. ASLAN001 is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against HER1 HER2 and HER4. Preclinical data have shown ASLAN001 to be more potent than lapatinib and neratinib in inhibiting HER1 and HER2 and early phase clinical studies have demonstrated superior pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic target inhibition compared to lapatinib. Furthermore ASLAN001 has demonstrated a better safety profile than lapatinib in early phase studies. ??The investigators hypothesize that ASLAN001 combined with paclitaxel/carboplatin will induce favorable pathological complete response (of at least 30%) in stage I-III HER2 positive breast cancer with a more favourable safety profile than lapatinib combined with paclitaxel/carboplatin.    ,NCT02396108

Breast Cancer,Eribulin as 1st Line Treatment in Elderly Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer, Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women world-wide the leading cause of cancer mortality. One of the strongest risk factors for developing breast cancer is age with a prevalence approaching 7% in women >70 years; more than 40% of breast cancer patients are older than 65 years. Although the survival rate has increased in the last years about one third of patients will relapse with distant metastases. Treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer is palliative therefore maintaining or improving quality of life. The use of taxanes and anthracyclines as first line chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer is widely accepted. Both taxanes and anthracyclines have considerable side effects especially in elderly patients. Eribulin a synthetic analogue of a chemotherapeutically active compound derived from the sea sponge Halichondria okadai acts as an inhibitor of microtubule dynamics. It is registered as palliative chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer after anthracyclines and taxanes. Studies with eribulin treatment have shown similar efficacy compared to anthracyclines and taxanes but less toxicity. Those studies showed that often the dose of eribulin had to be reduced during treatment due to toxicity without compromising the efficacy of the treatment. The main objective of the trial is to explore the efficacy of a reduced starting dose of eribulin as first-line treatment in elderly metastatic breast cancer patients. The secondary objective of the trial is to investigate the safety of eribulin in those patients. Eribulin mesilate 1.1mg/m2 i.v. will be administered intravenously every 3 weeks on day 1 and day 8 until progressive disease.    ,NCT02404506

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of a Physical Activity Program in Overweight Breast Cancer Patients," Patients diagnosed with breast cancer generally have a fairly well prognosis with estimated average survival rates of 73% and five year survival rates of 89% in developed countries. However women who are obese at the time of breast cancer diagnosis seem to be at risk for a worse breast cancer related and overall survival as compared to their normal weight counterparts. In addition weight gain after diagnosis might be negatively associated with prognosis. Weight gain is a common phenomenon among breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy as well as receiving adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy. While sufficient physical activity and limitation of the amount of weight gain is important for all breast cancer patients it surely is for overweight and obese patients. The recently published national guideline oncological rehabilitation provides exercise goals for physical training based on the Dutch PA guideline ""Nederlandse Norm Gezond Bewegen (NNGB)"". It recommends to engage in moderate-intensity exercise (e.g. brisk walking) for at least 30 minutes a day on at least 5 days a week. For people who are overweight (Body Mass Index ??25 kg/m2) it is recommended to exercise at least 60 minutes at a moderate-intensity level equal or more than 3 Metabolic Equivalent Task Hours (> 3 MET/h) on at least 5 days a week. However only 61% of the general population meets these guidelines (8) and among cancer patients this percentage is even less. This study aims to increase the percentage of overweight breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy that reaches the goal of the NNGB by the oncological rehabilitation program with 20%.

Breast Cancer,European Celecoxib Trial in Primary Breast Cancer, It has been found that the chemical changes that take place in a patient's body during the development of inflammation may provide an environment which stimulates cancer cells. One step in the development of inflammation is the production of certain chemical substances which are important in the formation and spread of tumours. These are called prostaglandins. Cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-2) is an enzyme (a substance that speeds up chemical changes in the body) involved in the production of these prostaglandins and although it is not usually present in most tissues it is made at the sites of inflammation. Celecoxib is a selective Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) which works by blocking the action of the COX-2 enzyme leading to a decrease in the production of prostaglandins and a reduction in inflammation. The purpose of this study is therefore to find out if celecoxib can be used after breast cancer treatment (chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy) to reduce inflammation and thus reduce the ability of new tumours to grow and survive. 2590 women with primary breast cancer will be recruited in this study from several locations in the United Kingdom and Germany. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated a treatment group which can be celecoxib or placebo. Both treatments are taken orally (celecoxib 400mg daily placebo 2 tablets daily) for a total of 2 years. In addition hormone receptor positive patients will receive endocrine treatment as per local practice. Patients will prematurely discontinue treatment with celecoxib/placebo if disease progression is confirmed or if patients experience unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be seen every 6 months for the first 3 years and then off treatment follow-up is carried out annually. Participating patients will also be given the option to take part in the pathology sub-study by donating a sample of the tumour tissue collected at the time of the primary surgery.    ,NCT02429427

The tracer has the potential of identifying the invasive cancer phenotype thereby distinguishing between aggressive and less aggressive tumors. This is a first in human study to test the radiotracer in cancer patients. The biodistribution and tumor uptake will be evaluated by repeated PET imaging (10 minutes 1 hour and 2 hours post injection).    ,NCT02437539
Breast Cancer,Feasibility Study of Intraoperative Imaging in Breast Cancer, For most breast cancer patients surgery is the primary treatment. When patients undergo a lumpectomy it is difficult for the surgeon to determine the extent of the tumor which results in incomplete tumor removal as determined by a positive margin assessment several days after the initial surgery is completed. Most patients with positive margins will undergo a second or even a third surgery to complete the tumor removal. The investigators hypothesize that the LUM Imaging System can reduce the rates of positive margins and thus the rates of second surgeries by identifying microscopic residual cancer in the tumor bed. This is a non-randomized open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intraoperative imaging system the LUM Imaging System (LUM015 in conjunction with LUM 2.6 Imaging Device) in identifying residual cancer in the tumor bed of female breast cancer subjects. The study is composed of a Feasibility Trial divided into two phases: Phase A (15 total subjects) and Phase B (up to 50 total subjects). During Phase A 15 subjects will be evaluated to collect additional patient safety data select the dose of LUM015 for Phase B and evaluate the device function. During Phase B subjects will be injected with LUM015 at the dose determined during Phase A to preliminarily assess the performance of the detection algorithm against pathology margin assessment. In Phase B the surgeon will perform standard of care surgery and then use the LUM Imaging System to guide the removal of additional cavity shavings as indicated by the LUM Imaging System.    ,NCT02438358
Breast Cancer,Cost-Effectiveness of Abdominal-based Autogenous Tissue vs Tissue Expander-Implant Reconstruction - A Feasibility Study," It is estimated that about 25% and 40% of health care expenditures in Canada and USA respectively are wasted because of inefficiencies and not practicing evidence-based medicine. As health care resources are scarce it behooves all of us to use these in a cost-effective manner. The term ""cost-effective"" is used in the health care literature often but erroneously. Investigators compare a ""novel' intervention to a ""prevailing"" one and if the novel intervention is less costly it is labeled ""cost-effective"". In a methodologically correct cost-effectiveness study however investigators need to integrate both the effectiveness and costs of the competing interventions and calculate an incremental cost-effective ratio. If this ratio falls within acceptability thresholds the novel intervention is labeled cost-effective. There are many techniques of breast reconstruction. The two most common approaches are the Autologous Abdominal Tissue (AAT) and the Tissue Expansion / Implant reconstructions. In this study these two most common breast reconstruction approaches after mastectomy due to cancer performed in the Hamilton/Niagara/Haldimand/Brant and Waterloo/Wellington LHINs will be investigated with a cost-effectiveness analysis coupled with a methodologically robust observational study.

Breast Cancer,Laser Therapy for the Prevention of Radiodermatitis in Breast Cancer Patients, Up to 90% of the radiotherapy patients will develop a certain degree of skin reaction at the treated area also known as radiodermatitis (RD). Currently there is a wide variety of strategies to manage RD including creams gels ointments wound dressings. However up to now there is still no comprehensive evidence-based consensus for the treatment of RD. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a promising non-invasive technique for treating RD. In a recent pilot study conducted in our research group LLLT prevented the aggravation of RD and provided symptomatic relief in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer after breast-sparing surgery. This pilot study was the first prospective study investigating the potential of LLLT for RD. In the current study we want to investigate the efficacy of LLLT as a tool for the prevention of radiodermatitis in breast cancer patients.    ,NCT02443493

Breast Cancer,Topical Doxepin for Radiation-induced Dermatitis, Radiation dermatitis is one of the most common side effects of radiotherapy approximately occurring in about 95% of patients receiving radiotherapy . Acute injury due to structural tissue damage generation of free radicals irreversible double-stranded breaks in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and initiation of an inflammatory response in the epidermis and dermis occurs within hours to weeks after radiation exposure. Radiation dermatitis due to pain and discomfort has an adverse impact on the quality of a patient's life.The radiation toxicities such as radiation dermatitis encountered in clinical practice are typically managed with a variety of topical agents such as water-based moisturizing creams or lotions topical steroids antiinflammatory emulsions and wound dressings. Pharmacologic interventions for the prevention and treatment of these toxicity can be used to protect skin against radiation damage.Currently there is no standard treatment for the prevention of radiation-induced dermatitis with demonstrated effectiveness.The aim of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the effectiveness of topical doxepin for the prevention and management of radiation-induced dermatitis during postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer.    ,NCT02447211

Breast Cancer,Assessment of Functional Status of Estrogen Receptors in Breast Cancer by Positron Emission Tomography, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the uptake of a radioactive tracer 21-18F-fluoro-16α17α-[(R)-(1'-α-furylmethylidene)dioxy]-19-norpregn-4-ene-320-dione (FFNP) uptake which binds to breast cancer progesterone receptors (PgRs) on a PET/CT scan before and after administration of estradiol for one day (estrogen challenge) to determine if the change in uptake is a predictor of response to endocrine therapy (ET) in patients with hormone-sensitive estrogen receptor positive (ER+) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. Estradiol is the most potent of the naturally occurring estrogens and can be administered to treat menopausal symptoms and also sometimes to treat metastatic breast cancer. The investigators propose to study patients with biopsy-proven newly diagnosed locally advanced metastatic or recurrent breast cancer who are going to be treated with endocrine therapy (ET) (tamoxifenaromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant as standard of care therapy. Subjects will undergo a total of two FFNP-PET/CT scans; one before and a second one immediately following the one day estradiol challenge before the start of standard of care ET. The estradiol challenge will consist of administering a total of 6 mg of estradiol orally (three doses of 2 mg each) given at approximately 8 hour intervals and over a 24 hour period.    ,NCT02455453

Breast Cancer,Tissue Procurement Protocol for Patients Undergoing Treatment for Early-Stage Breast Cancer, Through the investigators' Breast Care Center at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center the investigators treat approximately 75 patients per year with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The majority of the remainder of patients with stage II and III disease undergo treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy either on a clinical protocol or as standard of care. There is a subset of women with ER positive disease who do not receive chemotherapy because of favorable tumor characteristics. This tissue procurement protocol is designed to systematically collect tissue urine and blood specimens on patients undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy serially following treatment and/or at the time of disease recurrence in order to investigate mechanisms underlying development of metastatic disease to identify predictors of response and resistance to therapy and to test potential new therapies for breast cancer using a combination of patient-derived xenograft creation and new microfluidic technologies.    ,NCT02455882
Breast Cancer,Study of the Outcomes of Intraoperative Margin Assessment With MarginProbe, The combination of breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) with radiation therapy has been shown to result in equivalent overall survival rates compared to mastectomy for the local treatment of breast cancer. As a result the majority of patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States undergo lumpectomy as their primary surgical therapy. Multiple studies have demonstrated the association between positive lumpectomy margins and an increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence even with postoperative radiation. Studies report 20-40% of lumpectomy procedures result in one or more involved (positive) surgical margins leading to the need for further surgery emotional distress poorer cosmesis delay to adjuvant treatments and increased cost. Current available intraoperative margin assessment techniques include specimen Xray gross pathology frozen section and touch prep cytology. To reduce the incidence of positive margins the MarginProbe (Dune Medical Devices Caesarea Israel) was developed to provide real-time intraoperative assessment of the presence of tumor at the lumpectomy margin. In the current study the investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of MarginProbe as an adjunctive tool to standard practice for intraoperative identification of tumor at lumpectomy margins and its ability to reduce positive margins and decrease the need for additional surgical procedures.    ,NCT02456649
Breast Cancer,Women's Triple-Negative First-Line Study: Liposomal Doxorubicin Bevacizumab and Everolimus (DAE) in Patients With Localized Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) With Tumors Predicted Insensitive to Standard Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if receiving 4 cycles of experimental chemotherapy before surgery can help to shrink the size of tumors in the breast and/or lymph nodes before they are removed through surgery. The safety of this combination will also be studied.    ,NCT02456857
Breast Cancer,A Multi-Institutional Registry for CyberKnife Stereotactic Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (CK-SAPBI), This study is a registry to monitor quality of life and clinical outcomes in patients with clinically localized breast cancer who have received stereotactic accelerated partial breast irradiation via CyberKnife.    ,NCT02457117
Breast Cancer,2-weeks of Adjuvant Radiotherapy in Patients With Breast Cancer, The investigators at PGIMER have been practicing hypofractionation radiotherapy with a dose of 35Gy/15#/3wks to the chest wall in post mastectomy and 40Gy/16#/3wks in breast conservation in breast cancer patients for the last 4 decades. It is also a routine practice in UK and few centers in Canada. Hypofractionation reduces treatment time to half while maintaining cosmesis and gives control rates equal to conventional fractionation. As breast cancer is a leading cancer in females and radiation therapy is an important part of its local management hypofractionation help the radiation centers worldwide to meet the growing need for radiation in breast cancer particularly in developing countries where resources are limited. It also reduces the financial burden on the patient and family. In this study the investigators want to reduce the treatment duration from 3 weeks to 2 weeks. The study will include 20 patients with breast cancer post mastectomy or after breast conservative surgery to be treated with a radiotherapy dose of 34Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. Patients will be assessed for acute radiation toxicity weekly during treatment and after one month of completion of treatment.    ,NCT02460744

Breast Cancer,Effect of PPARγ2 Polymorphism and NSAIDs on Acute Alcohol-induced Changes in Serum Estrogens Among Post-menopausal Women, Postmenopausal women stratified by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 (PPARG) polymorphism were given the following treatments in a random order with a 5w wash-out period: a 400mg ibuprofen tablet or a placebo tablet; both treatments were followed after 30min by a single acute dose of 0.4g alcohol per kg bw. Serum estrogen levels were measured before and at three timepoints after alcohol intake. It is hypothesized that the acute decrease in estrogen sulphate and other markers of estrogens after alcohol intake is modulated by ibuprofen and by PPARG genotype.    ,NCT02463383
Breast Cancer,Breast-Conserving Therapy in Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer, RATIONALE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype shown to have a high risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR) and distant metastasis (DM). The equivalent impact of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and mastectomy on disease-free survival in patients with early breast cancer has been established by a number of large randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis. However ongoing dispute exists on whether TNBC is a good candidate for BCT. PURPOSE: This prospective randomized open single-center Phase III clinical study is conducted to compare efficacy and safety of breast-conserving therapy and mastectomy in treating Chinese patients with early TNBC.    ,NCT02464774

Breast Cancer,Comparison of Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Versus no Axillary Surgery, Although there is no doubt that the presence of lymph node metastases worsens prognosis of a patient unambiguous evidence to support lymph node dissection is still lacking. For many solid tumors the role of lymph node dissection is yet controversial and may depend on the tumor type and the stage of patient presentation for diagnosis. Axillary surgery for breast cancer is now considered as staging procedure that does not seem to influence breast cancer mortality. Women with breast cancer have benefitted greatly from a series of carefully performed randomized controlled trial focusing on axillary surgery. The objective of INSEMA is to show that less axillary surgery is better in that oncological outcomes are the same and less surgical intervention will result in fewer surgical complications.    ,NCT02466737

Breast Cancer,Physical Training and Cancer-a Multicenter Clinical Trial, Excessive tiredness (fatigue) is a common problem in cancer patients and can affect quality of life negatively. There is limited knowledge about the physical mechanisms that cause fatigue and there is no medical treatment. Physical activity can reduce the inconvenience but the investigators need to learn more about the type and intensity of exercise that works the best as well as how to motivate patients to exercise. The overall aim is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of individually tailored high (H) and low/medium (LM) intensity physical training with or without behavioural medicine (BM) support strategies during adjuvant oncological treatment on; Cancer Related Fatigue (CRF)Quality of Life (QoL) mood disturbance adherence to the cancer treatment adverse effects disease outcome return to a daily life after completed treatment and return to work. The investigators will also describe changes in inflammatory markers and cytokines related to physical training and gene expressions following training to investigate whether these serve as mediators for the effects of physical training on CRF and QoL. This will be evaluated in newly diagnosed breast colorectal and prostate cancer patients during adjuvant therapy at three different centres in Sweden; Uppsala Lund/Malmö and Linköping. A 2x2 factorial design will be used 600 patients will be randomised to H H+BM LM or LM+BM. Patients will train two times per week during 6 months. This project will give; new knowledge about aspects for individuals to gain improved well-being and quality of life facilitated return to work and possibly reduced risk of cancer recurrence. This in turn would result in lower burden on the health care system reduced societal costs and have a positive impact on public health. Implementation of the results into clinical practice will be facilitated by the close collaboration between researchers and clinicians and the fact that the study is performed in clinical settings.    ,NCT02473003

Breast Cancer,Endocrine Treatment Alone for Elderly Patients With Estrogen Receptor Positive Operable Breast Cancer and Low Recurrence Score, Multiple neoadjuvant endocrine trials demonstrate that women with good prognosis tumors can be identified. These trials have also demonstrated that there are not adverse effects on overall outcome if women are treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for several months prior to definitive treatment. A new standard of care needs to be defined for elderly women with good prognosis estrogen receptor (ER)+ tumors since these women may benefit from endocrine therapy alone to treat their cancer without compromising local and distant control. The investigators hypothesize that endocrine therapy alone provides adequate local and systemic control of breast cancer in a subpopulation of women 75 or older with ER+ breast cancer and low Ki67 scores.    ,NCT02476786
Breast Cancer,Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) Study, The aim of this study is to determine if the addition of Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) to standard diagnostic imaging results in a decision regarding patient management - discharge follow-up surgery or treatment - being made sooner than it would if the patient had followed the standard course of investigations and review. The investigators also intend to compare CESM with MRI. Images and pathology results from patients who undergo both CESM ans MRI will be reviewed retrospectively for detection of abnormality and identification of type of abnormality i.e. is it a cancer or not?    ,NCT02479100
Breast Cancer,Pilot Trial of Type I-Polarized Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccine Incorporating Tumor Blood Vessel Antigen-Derived Peptides in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, This pilot clinical trial studies the safety of a dendritic cell vaccine when given with gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast and local lymph nodes to other organs in the body. The vaccine is made up of natural cells found in the blood called dendritic cells and peptides or small fragments of protein which are loaded onto the dendritic cells. This combination may help activate the immune system against stromal cells which are cells that help cancer cells survive in the body. Gemcitabine hydrochloride is a chemotherapy drug that is given before the vaccine to help shrink the tumor and control cells that may interfere with the activity of the vaccine. Interfering with the stromal cells that help support the growth of cancer cells may lead to the death of the cancer cells.    ,NCT02479230

Breast Cancer,Clinical Application of Dual Sentinel Lymph Node Staining Method in Breast Cancer Patients, This study aimed to compare detection rate between dual sentinel node staining method using mixture of indocyanine green (ICG) with radioisotope(RI) and RI only. To identify the first lymph node(s) along the lymphatic drainage pathway from the primary tumor in the breast cancer using RI only has several disadvantages such as invisibility interference. As ICG can be visualized with a fluorescence imaging system we expects dual sentinel lymph node staining method had better outcomes.    ,NCT02479997
Breast Cancer,Cognitive Sequelae of Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for the Treatment of Breast Cancer in Older Women, Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women with the majority receiving an endocrine therapy (ET) in the adjuvant setting. ETs dramatically reduce recurrence and improve survival but given the aging population and increased survivorship there are growing concerns regarding the cognitive effects of ETs since estrogen is neuroprotective. A critical unanswered question is whether there are differences in cognitive decline between the two classes of ETs selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs - tamoxifen) and aromatase inhibitors (letrozole and anastrozole) in older women at greater risk of hormone receptor breast cancer and cognitive decline. Before a large multicentre observational study can be undertaken the investigators are proposing a feasibility study to establish metrics on participation retention and adherence rates and parameter estimates to inform sample size calculation required to detect cognitive differences between the two ET classes. A convenience sample of chemotherapy-naïve patients aged 65 and older with early stage disease 25 on a SERM and 50 on an aromatase inhibitor will be assessed cognitively at baseline and after one year.    ,NCT02480218

Breast Cancer,Pilot Study of Biomarkers and Cardiac MRI as Early Indicators of Cardiac Exposure Following Breast Radiotherapy, Patients with breast cancer receive low doses to smaller volumes of the heart but they also have an excellent long-term survival so it is crucial to study the effects of low dose radiotherapy. Indeed a recent study suggests that these effects can be seen within the first 5 years after treatment and that there is no dose threshold. The investigators wish to develop imaging and blood biomarkers of cardiac exposure as a first step to identifying patients at increased risk for cardiac effects. These patients can then be targeted for close monitoring and early intervention potentially with statins or ACE inhibitors. Additionally by characterizing a time-course and radiation dose-volume relationship potentially real-time modifications can be made to radiotherapy (RT) field design for patients sensitive to RT effects. Finally this information can be incorporated into better designs of treatment plans for future patients.    ,NCT02494453

Breast Cancer,Biomarkers and Cardiac MRI as Early Indicators of Cardiac Exposure Following Breast Radiotherapy, Radiotherapy plays an integral role in breast cancer therapy. Multiple randomized studies have demonstrated decreased local-regional recurrence rates and decreased breast-cancer mortality. However balanced with this survival benefit is the potential toxicity of the treatment itself. In particular cardiac effects of radiotherapy have been a concern and an area of research for the past 20 years. From long-term follow up of patients with lymphoma it is known that radiotherapy can lead to increased risk of myocardial infarction valvular dysfunction systolic and diastolic function abnormalities and heart failure among cancer-survivors. Patients with breast cancer receive lower doses to smaller volumes of the heart but they also have an excellent long-term survival so it is crucial to study the effects of low dose radiotherapy. Indeed a recent study suggests that these effects can be seen within the first 5 years after treatment and that there is no dose threshold. This study aims to develop imaging and blood biomarkers of cardiac exposure as a first step to identifying patients at increased risk for cardiac effects so they can be targeted for close monitoring and early intervention potentially with statins or ACE inhibitors. Additionally by characterizing a time-course and radiation dose-volume relationship potentially real-time modifications can be made to RT field design for patients sensitive to RT effects.

Breast Cancer,A Data Collection Study for the Evaluation of a Novel Infra-red Breast Imaging System for Risk Assessment, Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging (3D MIRA) is a new infrared imaging technology using the Real Imager 8 (RI8) developed by Real Imaging. This technology generates 3D metabolic maps of the breast and based on sophisticated machine learning technology provides objective risk assessment for the presence of malignant tumor in the breast. The procedure is non-invasive comfortable and does not involve ionizing radiation. It is based on acquiring infrared images of the breast. Those images are processed and analyzed by computers to provide the objective risk assessment. The technology is intended to be used as a screening tool for breast cancer and emerges as highly useful in women for whom screening mammography is sub-optimal such as women with dense breast. 3D MIRA is unaffected by breast density and is therefore ideal for evaluating patients with mammographically dense breasts. Real Imaging is continuously developing the technology including image acquisition hardware and objective analysis of the imaging biomarkers.

Breast Cancer,Late Toxicity in Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Breast-conserving Surgical Procedures and Radiotherapy Using the Simultaneous Integrated Boost Technique, In summary breast conserving therapy (BCT) is an effective save and widely used treatment technique for early breast cancer. Radiotherapy has shown to give better local control and survival benefit and is an integrated part of BCT. The simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique is a new treatment technique in breast irradiation. In this technique the whole breast is irradiated simultaneous with boosting the tumour bed as part of BCT. Late radiation-induced toxicity has not been investigated in patients treated with radiotherapy using this technique. Proposed study will study the late radiation-induced toxicity describe patients-rated complaints quality of life survival and local control curves in patients treated for early breast cancer with breast-conserving surgery in combination with radiotherapy with the SIB technique as compared to sequential radiotherapy treatment.    ,NCT02505906

Breast Cancer,Microwave Radiometry for the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Breast Cancer, A malignant tumor has higher temperature than normal tissue and the temperature of the tumor is dependent on the tumor growth rate. Thus tumor temperature is the universal indicator of tumor activity. The temperature changes begin in the stage of atypical hyperplasia and increased proliferation and this opens up the possibilities for detection of patients with high risk lesions. Microwave radiometer (RTM-01-RES) allows measurement of temperature changes of internal tissue at the depth of several centimetre and allows visualization of the temperature on the thermogram and temperature field. It is noninvasive and the measurement of internal temperature is based on receiving natural electromagnetic radiation from the tissue in the gigahertz (GHz) frequency range. The device is absolutely harmless and has no risk because it does not emit any radiation. It can be used repeatedly as a method of monitoring. Microwave radiometry has successfully completed seven clinical trials of more than 1000 patients in different countries. Microwave device (RTM-01-RES) is used in more than 300 medical centers in 30 countries. Medical technology of microwave radiometry is included in the nomenclature of medical services in the Russian Federation the Ministry of Health and is part of the standard of care for patients with malignant tumors of the breast. This method of microwave radiometry is recommended by leading Russian mammalogists in the National guidelines of breast care. The investigators would like to use the device in clinics in Scotland and later United Kingdom (UK) for breast diagnosis and monitoring treatment. During 3 months the investigators aim to examine 150 patients with breast cancer and 150 patients without cancer who will be the control group. The results of temperature measurement will be compared with the results of histology in particular tumour cellulants p53 expression and other gene expression data for metabolic biomarkers and other tumor indicator. Statistical analysis of data will be performed. The device and initial training will be provided by RES Company (device producer).    ,NCT02514837

Breast Cancer,Study to Validate a Model of Surgical Deescalation in Atypicals Breast Lesions, Routine screening mammography has increased the non-palpable suspicious lesion detection rate requiring histopathological evaluation. The discovery of atypical lesions on the breast biopsy is associated with two interrelated risks:   1. The risk of underestimating the severity of the lesion biopsied currently leads systematically to achieve a surgical resection for these patients while a breast cancer (BC) will finally identified at surgery in 10 to 25% of cases. Thus unnecessary surgeries will be performed in 75 to 90% of cases (no cancer).   2. These breast lesions confer long-term increase in the subsequent risk of breast cancer (cumulative incidence of 15 to 25% at 25 years). Thus women identified with atypical lesions are then followed using clinical and mammographic annual evaluation. The goal would be to get a model to assess the risk and no longer operate those patients at high risk of BC. Several groups have attempted to identify predictors of concurrent or secondary BC associated with the discovery of an unusual lesion at biopsy. However they are often focused on a subtype of atypia (eg atypical metaplasia atypical ductal hyperplasia atypical lobular hyperplasia) and no prediction model has been validated in prospective multicenter. Based on a large retrospective study at Gustave Roussy a prediction model (Nomat) has been developed common to all atypical lesions which can predict the presence of a BC at excision surgery (risk of concurrent BC). This model is based on the age of the patient the disappearance of radiographic abnormalities (microcalcifications in general) after the biopsy and initial radiological lesion size. This model has good performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72. In previous series with a BC high-risk threshold of 20% negative predictive value was 90% and this model would have prevented the surgery in 51% of patients (low risk patients by model). It is essential to validate this model by forward-looking and in different centers to ensure its relevance. This is a multicenter prospective validation of the model on 300 patients operated for atypical lesions in 20 centers. All patients with atypical breast lesions have a routine surgery. The clinical data imaging and histological data will be collected prospectively. The main objective of this study is to validate the model Nomat.    ,NCT02523612
Breast Cancer,Relationships Among Cognitive Function Lifestyle and Exercise After Cancer Treatment, The purpose of this study is to examine relationships among lifestyle behaviors (i.e. physical activity sleep) cognitive function (i.e. memory processing speed and executive function) and quality of life in breast cancer patients and survivors across time. The investigators will compare the strength of these relationships across age cohorts and time since treatment and diagnosis. Participants will complete a battery of questionnaires and a set of cognitive tests on an iPad app specifically tailored for this study. A subset of participants will also wear an accelerometer for seven days. Data will be collected at baseline and 6-month follow-up. This research is critical to identifying potentially important approaches to improving health outcomes and quality of life in breast cancer patients and survivors. Previous research provides evidence of the influence of lifestyle behaviors on cognition and quality of life in healthy aging populations. However despite data indicating cancer's negative impact on lifestyle behaviors cognition and quality of life very few studies have investigated interactions among these factors in cancer patients and survivors.    ,NCT02523677

Breast Cancer,Effectiveness of DIM Supplements to Increase 2-OHE1/16 Ratio, Breast cancer is a public health problem in Mexico and its incidence rises when the woman is still premenopausal. Estrogen metabolism has been linked to breast cancer. Several studies reported that high concentrations of 2 hydroxyestrone (2OHE1) in urine have a protective effect for this neoplasia whereas high concentrations of 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone (16αOHE1) in urine have the opposite effect further has been reported that women with a ratio of estrogen metabolites 2OHE1:16αOHE1 in urine (REMU) less than 0.9 have ten times the risk of developing Breast Cancer than those women with an RMEU equal or more than 0.9. Other studies have showed that the active compounds of cruciferous vegetables indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its dimer 3'3'diindolylmethane (DIM) induce benign pathway of metabolism of estrogens producing 2OHE1. Several studies evaluate the pharmacokinetics and effect of I3C supplementation finding that 300 to 600 mg of this compound are well tolerated and able to promote formation of 2OHE1 in women when supplemented for one month. In the case of DIM only a pilot study has explored its effect in postmenopausal women with personal history of breast cancer in early stages reporting an increase in the concentrations of 2OHE1. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation with DIM to increase urinary RMEU in premenopausal women at risk of Breast Cancer (RMEU less than 0.9). A clinical randomized double-blind study was performed with women attending on the urogynecology service of Institute National of Perinatology. Subjects were premenopausal women over 34 years who were healthy. The inclusion criteria's was had a RMEU less than 0.9 and were excluded for any medical condition medication or dietary or lifestyle habit that might interfere with estrogen metabolism. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one received orally at a daily dose of 75 mg of DIM for a period of 30 days and other group received orally at a daily placebo for a period of 30 days. All urine samples were collected from the women before DIM or placebo ingestion after 30 days of DIM or placebo ingestion and finally after another 30 days once suspended supplementation. Analysis of the 2OHE1 and 16αOHE1 were determined using a commercially kit ESTRAMET?? The change in metabolites median concentrations and RMEU was assessed through the Wilcoxon test and these differences between groups through U Mann-Whitney test.    ,NCT02525159
Breast Cancer,Continues Cicatricial Perfusion of Ropivacaine Versus Placebo After Mastectomy : Rehabilitation After Treatment, The acute pain care in particular after breast cancer surgery must be early and quickly effective because a severe postoperative pain increases the risk of chronic pain and exposes to a risk of important embarrassment for the realization of simple daily movements. Associated to conventional analgesics administered by systemic way a local anesthesic (ropivacaine) can be continuously infused (Continues Cicatricial Perfusion CCP) in the operating wound by a multi-drilled catheter by means of a elastomeric diffuser set up in the surgical unit by the surgeon at the end the surgical procedure. Besides the control of the postoperative acute pain the local anesthesic could intervene in the prevention of the chronic pain the early recovery the reduction of the neuropathic pains and the decrease of needs in morphine after mastectomy. The duration of hospitalization being lower than 48 hours for this type of surgery the investigators envisage an immediate follow-up in the Units of Care then at home what will require a training of the hospital actors and at home (patient family visiting nurse general practitioner). Although proposed for several years the CCP after breast surgery is still a little spread technique and few works had evaluated the pain at rest and at mobilization after mastectomy the early rehabilitation and to spread its use towards home that is why we propose a randomized double-blind study ropivacaine / placebo in patients after mastectomy.    ,NCT02525211

Breast Cancer,Feasibility Study of Cavity Radiofrequency Ablation in ex Vivo Mastectomy Breast Tissue, The purpose of this study is to build a device that will consistently ablate (destroy or remove) cavitary breast tissue after a formal breast cancer resection in order to mimic the tissue that is now irradiated after breast cancer lumpectomy. The device would be easier to handle perform the ablation in less time and by so ablating this margin would avoid the need in many for reoperation to obtain negative margins and based on preliminary data avoid the need for radiation. This would be especially important in poor and rural patients and would lead to decreased costs of treatment in patients with favorable breast cancer.    ,NCT02525913
Breast Cancer,Nipple Delay Prior to Nipple Sparing Mastectomy: A Pilot RCT, The goal of nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) with immediate breast reconstruction is to reconstruct a breast mound with preservation a patient's natural skin envelope. Preservation of the nipple and areola complex during mastectomy and breast reconstruction is associated with improved quality of life and a better cosmetic result. However this surgical technique relies on tenuous blood supply to maintain the nipple and areola. Therefore a certain proportion of women will actually lose their preserved nipple-areolar complex due to vascular insufficiency. Furthermore some women may find out after a nipple-sparing mastectomy that cancer had invaded the nipple-areolar complex and would require another operation to completely remove the cancer. Despite these devastating complications there have been no controlled studies to investigate mechanisms to reduce the chance of their occurrence. Our research study will use a pre-operative minor procedure to enhance blood flow to the nipple-areola complex prior to standard nipple sparing mastectomy among eligible women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer or risk reduction. A secondary objective is to test how many women actually have active cancer in their nipple at the time of this minor surgical procedure prior to standard NSM. The investigators hypothesize that our innovative and novel nipple-delay procedure will reduce the risk of loss of the nipple due to vascular insufficiency and may be of benefit to identify the small proportion of women with nipple-areola complex involvement in order to optimize the ultimate cancer ablation. For this study the investigators propose to undertake a Pilot RCT as the first step in the evaluation of a delay procedure prior to NSM and the results will be used to determine the feasibility and inform the optimal design for a definitive RCT. This study question has the potential to set a new standard of care in the management of women seeking NSM for the management of their breast cancer.    ,NCT02526719

The purpose of this research study is to see the benefit this three month vaginal estrogen tablet Vagifem has on the bladder vaginal symptoms and health. The investigators also want to monitor whether the bones might be impacted by estrogen or its absence. If there is an effect on bones it means that some estrogen may be absorbed from the tablet to affect other places in the body. The investigators are hoping to prove this is not the case. The investigators will also be measuring the quality of life of women participating in the study.    ,NCT02528383
Breast Cancer,Choices for Latinas and Clinical Trials," ""Increasing Access of Latinas into Breast Cancer Clinical Trials"" aims to develop and pilot test a multi-communications approach - using a culturally relevant computer video a tailored booklet and a patient navigator (PN) - to empower Latinas to make informed decisions about breast cancer clinical trials (BCCTs). Latinos represent 15% of the U.S. population but only 5.6% of participants in National Cancer Institute (NCI) treatment clinical trials resulting in disparities in cancer outcomes and jeopardizing the generalizability of trial findings.

Breast Cancer,Neoadjuvant Lenvatinib Combined With Letrozole in Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer, Background: Endocrine therapy is the standard treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer. However both primary and acquired resistance occurs and better strategies to improve treatment outcome and overcome resistance are urgently needed. There is known cross talk between RET and ER and preclinical studies have suggested that combining a RET inhibitor with endocrine therapy may improve cell kill in breast cancer cell lines. Aim: To determine the safe dose of lenvatinib that can be co-administered with letrozole in a phase Ib study followed by a phase II study to determine the efficacy of lenvatinib + letrozole in post-menopausal patients newly diagnosed with hormone receptor positive breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. Methods: Eligible patients will be treated with 2 weeks of single agent lenvatinib followed by 12 weeks of lenvatinib + letrozole. Blood and tumor samples will be obtained from the patient serially to study tumor and host factors that may influence drug efficacy and toxicity. Importance of the proposed research: The combination of lenvatinib + letrozole may improve the treatment response in some ER+ breast cancers. The study will seek to identify biomarkers (eg tumor RET expression) that may select patients most likely to benefit from the combination therapy. Potential benefits and risks: The combination may improve treatment response. Adding lenvatinib may increase treatment risks but these will be monitored closely. Pharmacokinetic analyses will also be performed to determine the drug levels achieved in the patients and correlate that with treatment toxicity and efficacy.    ,NCT02562118

Breast Cancer,Research and Analysis of the Mechanisms Involved in the Emergence of Breast Cancer Stem Cells (RepriM), From a cellular perspective breast cancers appear to develop hierarchically from a small contingent of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The presence of CSCs in tumor tissue is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and metastasis as well as a worse prognosis. Thus these CSCs exhibit resistance to conventional anti-tumor treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Moreover these treatments would favor the emergence of these CSCs and the reprogramming of non-CSCs in CSCs. It has been demonstrated in neoadjuvant that the proportion of CSCs before any treatment is correlated with chemoresistance and that a resurgence of CSCs after chemotherapy is correlated with a poor prognosis. However the mechanisms involved in the emergence of CSCs by reprogramming of non-CSCs are not yet known. The Oscar Lambret Center proposes a monocentric prospective interventional study based on the cellular and molecular analysis of the tumor serum and circulating cells before during and at the end of the treatment for each patient receiving a neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. The identification of the mechanisms contributing to the enrichment of CSCs resistant to chemotherapy could lead to therapeutic solutions.    ,NCT02570100

Breast Cancer,Behavioral Weight and Symptom Management for Breast Cancer Survivors and Partners, The objective of the study is to develop and test the feasibility acceptability and initial efficacy of a novel couples-based behavioral weight and symptom management intervention for obese breast cancer survivors and their partners. The proposed project consists of two phases. Phase I will include intervention development and refinement. Intervention development will be guided by the research team's prior work the interdependence model of communal coping and behavior change and information obtained from couples participating in focus groups. The intervention protocol will then be tested with 5 couples to assist with refinement of intervention content. During phase II the feasibility acceptability and initial efficacy of the intervention will be examined. Obese breast cancer survivors in the first year following treatment and their overweight or obese partners will receive 6 weekly and 6 biweekly sessions for a total of 12 sessions spaced across approximately 5 months. The intervention will be provided in a couples-based format where each couple will meet separately with the therapist. Couples will be assessed at pre- post- and 3-months post-treatment. Study outcomes will be weight symptoms (i.e. pain fatigue distress) eating behavior and physical activity. Exploratory outcomes examine biomarkers (i.e. insulin IL-6 IL-8 TNF-alpha adiponectin) associated with health outcomes for cancer survivors and their partners. It is hypothesized that the intervention will be feasible (i.e. completed sessions) and participants will find the intervention acceptable as assessed by a measure of treatment acceptability. It is also hypothesized that participants will evidence decreased weight and improvements in symptoms (i.e. pain fatigue distress) eating behavior and physical activity and their change in weight will covary with change in symptoms eating behavior and daily physical activity. Finally it is hypothesized that participants with greater weight loss will evidence improved functioning in insulin IL-6 IL-8 TNF-α adiponectin and heart rate.    ,NCT02574507

Breast Cancer,Walking Affecting Immunology and Quality of Life of Breast Cancer Patients, Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women worldwide. The incidence of breast cancer is increasing probably due to the prolonged life expectancy and a variety of environmental factors. Fortunately breast cancer outcome and survival are improving due to early detection and new treatment modalities. After making first strides against breast cancer i.e. undergoing ablation surgery most breast cancer survivors still have to go through a series of chemotherapy which could prolong their survival but almost inevitably downgrade their quality of life due to grueling side effects such as lack of energy and vulnerability to infection. Numerous medical interventions have been tried by healthcare providers to alleviate these side effects but some of them are expensive and therefore become another burden for the cancer-afflicted patients. Previous studies have already indicated that exercise generated long-term benefits to breast cancer survivors including improved physical functions elevated maximal oxygen intake decreases in lethargic symptom increase in both immune function and quality of life. Among a variety of exercises walking is the least costly easy-to-follow type. Through a simple predesigned walking regimen the investigators expected that the breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy could cost-effectively reap some benefit either physically or psychologically. Cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3+) presenting at all stages of T-cell development is a useful maker to identify T-cells. (Cluster of differentiation 4)CD4+ T cells also known as T helper cells play an assistant role in the immunologic process such as maturation of B cells activations of macrophages or cytotoxic T cells. Cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+) T cells known as cytotoxic T cells responsible for destroying virus-infected cells and tumor cells. Generally the counts of CD3+ T cells CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells could be a reflection of immune system health. Short-Form 36(SF-36) a patient-reported survey is a widely adopted tool to evaluate patient's individual health status. By means of serial blood sample collections and the delivery of SF-36 survey this study aimed to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the effects of aerobic walking on the breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.    ,NCT02581956

Breast Cancer,Tomosynthesis Versus Digital Mammography in a Population-based Screening Program, Preliminary results from prospective screening trials show that Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is more sensitive and more specific than conventional digital mammography (DM). However large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to confirm these promising results. Furthermore potential side effects of DBT in the screening setting have to be properly evaluated. In particular the major concern is about overdiagnosis and its consequences; overdiagnosis refers to the detection of cancers at screening which would not have become clinically apparent in the woman's lifetime. This RCT was designed to compare benefits and harms of DBT in a population-based screening program with conventional DM. The primary outcome parameter will be the difference between the two tests in rates of advanced cancers detected at the subsequent round and interval cancers (within the first two years after the study screening round). Secondary outcomes measures will be diagnostic performance indicators for organised breast screening (i.e cancer detection rate recall rate false positive rate positive predictive value) parameters used in cost-effectiveness analysis pathologic and biological characteristics of screen-detected cancers.    ,NCT02590315

Breast Cancer,Activity & Cognition After Treatment for Breast Cancer, This study addresses an important public health concern; impoverished cognitive function associated with treatment of breast cancer. Due to increased awareness of breast cancer combined with advances in medical care there are over 2.8 million women living with a history of breast cancer in the U.S. alone. Chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy to remove cancerous tissue can result in deficits in attention speed of processing memory and quality of life. Physical activity has been associated with a number of health benefits for breast cancer survivors including improvements in cognitive function. However most of the literature is cross-sectional and it is unclear whether acute (single) bouts of physical activity affect cognition and if they do how long this effect lasts. This study will be the first to the investigators' knowledge to examine the effects of an acute bout of aerobic exercise on cognitive functioning in breast cancer survivors. Specifically the investigators will determine the effects of a 30-minute moderate intensity aerobic exercise session (treadmill walking) on immediate and one hour follow up changes in measures of processing speed memory and executive function. Additionally accelerometer cut-points for physical activity intensities in breast cancer survivors will be assessed. Finally the investigators will examine the association of cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity with changes in cognitive function. Findings from this study will allow researchers to determine whether any acute effects of exercise on cognition are retained over time and therefore have real meaning in the context of one's daily life.    ,NCT02592070

Breast Cancer,Effectiveness of a Psycho-educational Group (PEG) Intervention on Supportive Care and Survivorship Issues in Early-stage Breast Cancer Survivors Who Have Received Systemic Treatment, As cancer mortality rates improve in Asia there is an increasing focus on patient-reported outcomes and survivorship issues. In view of the numerous medication and psychosocial issues that are commonly faced by early-stage breast cancer survivors it deems important to develop and conduct specific interventional programs to mitigate these problems. In the literature it is well recognized that psychosocial interventions are effective to manage emotional distress and quality of life with the evidence clearly clustered in studies on female patients with breast cancer. One meta-analysis suggested that psycho-oncologic interventions including individual psychotherapy group psychotherapy psychoeducation relaxing training can produce positive effects on emotional distress anxiety and depression and health-related QOL. The investigators hypothesize that a significant reduction in anxiety improvement of cognition and improvement of health-related quality of life among those who receive psycho-education in comparison to those in the usual care. Hence this randomized trial is designed to assess the effectiveness of a psycho-educational group (PEG) intervention on supportive care and survivorship issues which include anxiety depression cognitive function toxicities management of cancer- or treatment- related physical symptoms and health-related quality of life in early-stage breast cancer patients.    ,NCT02600299

Breast Cancer,The Andromeda Study.Predictive Value of Combined Criteria to Tailor Breast Cancer Screening., Some women have a higher risk than others of developing breast cancer. Unhealthy lifestyles high breast density family history obesity the presence of biomarkers associated with early neoplastic changes (considered alone or in combination) are just some of main factors that can increase the risk of breast cancer. Women with a higher risk may need to undergo more intensive screening activities which include more frequent inspections and the possibility of experiment different types of tests. Instead low risk women could be screened at longer intervals in order to reduce the screening harms (false positive results overdiagnosis radiation exposure discomfort caused by the test itself etc.) The ANDROMEDA Study aims at creating the possibility to customize the screening paths through a combined analysis of the above mentioned risk factors. Women consenting to be involved in the study will be asked to provide information on their lifestyle habits and reproductive history. Furthermore a blood sample will be collected for further bio-molecular analysis purposes.    ,NCT02618538

Breast Cancer,Neoadjuvant Run-In Study With TAK-228 Followed by Letrozole/TAK-228 in Women With High-Risk ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer, Millennium has developed TAK-228 which is a novel highly selective orally bioavailable adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase referred to as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). TAK-228 (formerly INK128 or MLN0128) targets 2 distinct multiprotein complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. TAK-228 selectively and potently inhibits mTOR kinase (IC50 = 1.1 nM) inhibits mTORC1/2 signaling and prevents cellular proliferation. The mTOR complex (mTORC) is an important therapeutic target that is generally stable (i.e. low tendency to mutate) and is a key intracellular point of convergence for a number of cellular signaling pathways. Inhibiting mTOR may inhibit abnormal cell proliferation tumor angiogenesis and abnormal cellular metabolism thus providing the rationale for mTOR inhibitors as potential agents in the treatment of a number of indications including solid tumor and hematological malignancies as either monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Like rapamycin several newly approved rapalogs (temsirolimus and everolimus) are specific and allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1 and only partially inhibit mTORC1 signaling pathways. They do not directly inhibit mTORC2 which has shown to be an emerging target in cancer research. TAK-228 was developed to address the incomplete inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapalogs. Eligible subjects will have a research biopsy and baseline blood and urine studies done within two weeks prior to start of study treatment. Subjects will then be treated with TAK-228 for 10 days and a repeat biopsy and pharmacokinetics will be done on day 11. The subject will then be treated with the combination of TAK-228 and letrozole for an additional 110 days before undergoing resection of the primary tumor. Subjects will be treated at the recommended Phase II dose of TAK-228 of 3 mg once daily and a dose deescalation to 2 mg daily will be performed if dose-limiting toxicity is seen in 1/3 or more of the subjects at the first dose level. The maximum tolerated dose cohort will be expanded to include six to ten subjects.    ,NCT02619669

Breast Cancer,PErsonalized TREatment of High-risk MAmmary Cancer - the PETREMAC Trial," Breast cancer is an optimal ""model disease"" for studying personalized medicine. Breast cancer was the first malignancy for which a predictive factor forecasting response to therapy was identified nearly 50 years ago; the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER). Furthermore breast cancer is by far the malignancy in which prognostic and predictive factors have been most extensively studied. Primary medical treatment (pre-surgical medical therapy) offers a unique setting to explore predictive factors due to the fact that primary breast cancers are easily accessible to repeated tissue sampling and evaluation of therapy response both clinically and radiologically. For many years the investigators have studied predictive factors in primary medical treatment of breast cancer. In the present project the investigators will implement a new trial concept where the current knowledge from previous trials with respect to predictive markers (hormone receptors HER2; TP53 CHEK2 and RB1) will be combined with massive parallel sequencing (MPS). Thereby the investigators aim to design the ""next-generation"" primary medical treatment where 1) therapy regimens are individualized based on a limited number of known predictive factors and 2) MPS is used to explore additional predictive factors and their co-regulators in order to fully identify the mechanisms of drug sensitivity / resistance across individual tumours and pave the way for further personalized breast cancer therapy in the future. As for the new era of ""genomic medicine"" the current trial concept will allow individual tumours to be characterized by their unique gene mutation / epigenetic modification profile upfront to allocate patients to their optimal personalized medicine as compared to ""classical"" drug testing through phase II/III trials.

Breast Cancer,Multicenter Prospective Cohort of Informal Caregivers in Burgundy and Franche-Comté, Medical progress and modification of lifestyles have prolonged life expectancy despite the development of chronic diseases. The support and care are often provided by a network of informal caregivers composed of family friends and neighbors. They became essential to help maintening the elderly persons to live at home. It has been demonstrated that the importance and the diversity of informal tasks may jeopardize their own physical mental and social well-being. The aim of the Informal Carers of Elderly Cohort is to define through a longitudinal study of their life course the profiles of caregivers of patients with a diagnosis of one of the following diseases: cancer (breast prostate colon-rectum) neuro-degenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's and similar diseases) neuro-vascular diseases (Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)) Age-related Macular Degeneration(AMD) and heart disease (heart failure) aged ??60 years old and living in Burgundy or Franche-Comte. By following the different phases of the caregiving relationship from the announcement of the diagnosis it will be possible to assess the quality of life of caregivers and evaluate the implementation of a pragmatic social action to help informal caregivers through a randomized intervention trial nested in the cohort. Thanks to an analytical and longitudinal definition of the profiles of informal caregivers this study could gather precise information on their life courses and their health trajectory by identifying the consequences associated with the concept of their role of aid in care. In addition the randomized intervention trial will explore the efficacy in terms of quality of life and efficiency of a social action to support the caregivers. These data will allow to identify strategies that could be used to improve the existing sources of aid and to propose new approaches to help caregivers. This study will provide the opportunity to identify the most relevant means of support and to give an impulse for new healthcare policies.    ,NCT02626377

Breast Cancer,Mifepristone for Breast Cancer Patients With Higher Levels of Progesterone Receptor Isoform A Than Isoform B., -  Seventy per cent of breast cancers express estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) and respond to endocrine treatment.   -  Actual therapy targets ER.   -  There is enough evidence that progestins participate regulating breast cancer growth.   -  Antiprogestins block cell proliferation and increase apoptosis in breast cancer models which express high levels of PRA.   -  Antiprogestins have been used to treat breast cancer patients that failed to other treatments; benefits were seen in selected patients.   -  Mifepristone (MFP) is currently used for medical abortion and for the treatment of Cushing disease.   -  MFP might exert agonistic effects when PRB isoform is activated by cAMP. This makes mandatory the evaluation of the PR isoform ratio in breast cancer patients in which MFP is a therapeutic possibility. Main Goal To evaluate if therapeutic doses of MFP exert beneficial effects on breast cancers expressing levels of PRA higher than those of PRB evaluated as an inhibition in proliferation markers and/or an increase in apoptotic markers.   -  Eligibility   -  Postmenopausal women (one year after menses stop).   -  Women with tumors showing ratios of PRA/PRB higher than 1.5 and PR higher than 50%.   -  Women without previous treatment.   -  All clinical stages with tumors larger than 1.5 cm.   -  Patients without autoimmune diseases and/or asthma.   -  Study design   -  Open Interventional.   -  Twenty women will take MFP (200 mg) p.o. once /day during 14 days. As for preliminary studies to reach this number the investigators will have to evaluate 80-100 patients.   -  Surgery is performed 14 days after treatment initiation 24 hs after last dose.   -  PR isoform ratio will be evaluated by western blots (WB) in one core biopsy. Additional cores will be used for diagnosis immunohistochemistry (IHC) of PR Ki-67 and other markers.   -  At surgery samples will be frozen for molecular studies and fixed and processed for pathological evaluation.   -  Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to evaluate differences in biomarker expression between core biopsy and surgical samples of each patient.   -  Blood will be collected before treatment initiation and prior to final surgery.   -  Mammographic and echographic studies will be carried out before and after treatment.    ,NCT02651844

Breast Cancer,Reproductive Health Survivorship Care Plan, The investigators propose to test the efficacy of the Reproductive Health Survivorship Care Plan (SCP-R) a novel survivorship care tool to meet the reproductive health needs of young breast cancer survivors (YBCS). Most YBCS undergo chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy treatments that impair ovarian function and result in significant reproductive health late effects. These late effects include symptoms of estrogen deprivation such as hot flashes fertility concerns limited contraception options and sexual problems. Together they have a major negative impact on quality of life. Despite substantial research treatment guidelines and clinical expertise on these issues most YBCS and their healthcare providers have limited guidance on how best to manage these reproductive health late effects. The research team has generated a practical accessible evidence-based reproductive health survivorship care plan (the SCP-R) for YBCS and their providers to address this deficit in survivorship care. This clinical trial will test if YBCS who receive the web-based SCP-R are more likely than controls to improve on at least one of these reproductive health issues: hot flashes sexual health fertility concerns and contraception.    ,NCT02667626
Breast Cancer,Investigating the Use of Drains and (Internal) Quilting Sutures on Seroma Formation Following Mastectomy, Seroma formation is a common complication following breast and axillary surgery for breast cancer. The use of drains is commonplace in practice after mastectomy although there is evidence to suggest that they do not affect the incidence of symptomatic seroma formation. Methods have been adopted in attempts to decrease seroma formation to varying results which include the use of deep sutures. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of drains and quilting sutures on the incidence of seroma formation. Patients undergoing mastectomy and axillary surgery for breast cancer will be eligible. Patients will be randomized to either receive a drain no drain or no drain with quilting sutures. The primary outcome measure will be the incidence of symptomatic seroma. Secondary outcome measures will be postoperative length of stay and postoperative pain scores.    ,NCT02668263

Breast Cancer,Developing a Healthy Lifestyle in Breast Cancer Survivors, At this time no study has examined the effect of a lifestyle intervention with a reduced Sedentary Behavior (SB) prescription on overall physical activity weight loss metabolic dysfunction and inflammation in breast cancer survivors. Thus in collaboration with University of Tennessee Medical Center's (UTMC) Cancer Institute investigators propose to randomize 30 female breast cancer survivors (history of breast cancer stages I [> 1 cm] II or III) with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 45 kg/m2 who are sedentary (engage in > 8 hours a day of SB) and inactive (engage in < 100 min/wk MVPA) to one of three 3-month conditions:   1. lifestyle intervention (Lifestyle) (increase MVPA to > 200 min/wk);   2. lifestyle intervention with a reduced SB prescription (Lifestyle+SB) (increase MVPA to > 200 min/wk and reduce SB by 2 hrs/day); or   3. weight management education materials provided via mailed newsletter (Newsletter). Lifestyle and Lifestyle+SB will receive a standard dietary (low-calorie [1200-1500 kcal/day] low-fat [<30% calories from fat]) prescription that emphasizes intake of fruits vegetables and whole grains and a cognitive behavioral intervention to assist with meeting activity and diet goals. Dependent variables measured at 0 and 3 months include objectively measured SB LPA MVPA and total activity via accelerometry; self-reported SB; percent weight loss; insulin and glucose and leptin and C-reactive protein (CRP) (biomarkers of cancer prognosis that have been found to be positively related to SB and/or adiposity); diet; body composition; and fitness.    ,NCT02677857
Breast Cancer,Rate of Histological Response After Mastectomy and Mammary Reconstruction at the Close of Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy, At present it is widely admitted not proposing immediate mammary reconstruction when an adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated because of the significant change of the cosmetic result (profit) and it whatever is the technique of reconstruction adopted. This is true all the more as it is about a reconstruction by prosthesis because of the prothetic died risk of hull(shell). Teams proposed immediate mammary reconstructions to expanding (carrier) patients of carcinoma infiltrating sometimes locally moved forward. For these patients was not brought back(reported) by increase of the risk of local or remote relapse. Two studies estimated afterward the feasibility of the mastectomy with immediate mammary reconstruction at the close of the chemotherapy and of the radiotherapy. The rate of morbidity is judged as acceptable. The rate of local second offense(recurrence) was similar to the patients benefiting from the classic therapeutic plan. During an other study ( M-RIC) it was shown that the inversion of therapeutic sequence is possible and that by prescribing the chemotherapy and the radiotherapy before immediate mammary reconstruction the morbidity is acceptable. It is acquired that the chemotherapy néoadjuvant is equivalent to the post-operative chemotherapy as regards the global survival. On the other hand the rate of histological answer according to subgroups is very different. This rate can vary of 9 % for tumors RH + negative Her2 in 45 % for tumors RH- Her2 over expression. There are 33 % for the RH + Her2 + and of 35 % for triple-negative. The purpose of the investigators study is to estimate the rate of histological response during the inversion of therapeutic sequence to make sure of the oncologic safety(security) in particular by molecular subgroups considering the heterogeneousness of the results(profits) after chemotherapy néoadjuvant only. Sataloff and Chevallier Classifications is the references and will be used here but the investigators can also use Symmans classification in addition. The rate of local and metastatic second offenses(recurrences) will also be estimated.    ,NCT02679040

Breast Cancer,Olaparib in Locally Advanced ER PgR and HER2 Negative (Triple Negative) and in Locally Advanced Germline BRCA Mutation-positive Breast Cancer Patients, Treatment selection for breast cancer is still largely empiric and guided by large randomized clinical trials on populations of patients. This approach is inadequate for the selection of individualized chemotherapy regimens. Estimates of benefits for individuals are extrapolations from the effects seen in these large trials and do not necessarily apply to individual patients. The revolution in genomics promises to transform oncology care. By better defining cancer subtypes a better understanding of breast cancer biology should help to guide treatment. The up-front phase we have decide to adopt play a pivotal role as it is useful for testing a targeted therapeutic drug such as olaparib wich also requires development of new biomarkers which may be useful for future studies. With this approach it could be possible to demonstrate drug target or biomarker effect in clinical setting and models the relationship between the pharmacodynamics and the pharmacokinetics. Additional benefits of this approach include the following:   -  It could facilitate rational drug selection identify therapeutic failures early and compress timelines for anticancer drug development.   -  It could provide initial rationale and guiding principles for further drug development based on studies in humans (rather than xenografts where tissues of one species are transplanted to another species).   -  As it focuses on extensively characterizing how a drug works and whether it hits its intended target (including molecular imaging studies) in a limited number of patients it could yield results that would optimally inform and expedite the subsequent development of molecularly-targeted agents    ,NCT02681562

Breast Cancer,Addition of PD-L1 Antibody MEDI4736 to a Taxane-anthracycline Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer, To date no targeted agents are available to treat TNBC. Therefore chemotherapy is the only treatment option. TNBC often has a high amount of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. Stimulating the immune cells of TNBC might therefore be an option for these patients to increase the pathological complete response. pCR is highly correlated with outcome in TNBC. Therefore the addition of a checkpoint inhibitor in addition to chemotherapy might be an additional option for these patients.    ,NCT02685059

The cardiac biomarkers that will be tested are effective in the diagnosis risk-stratification and monitoring of heart failure.    ,NCT02688166
Breast Cancer,Assessing Treatment Response in Breast Cancer With Functional Imaging, Patients with large primary operable breast cancers are offered chemotherapy prior to surgery to shrink the tumour and enable breast conserving surgery. Conventional assessment of response to chemotherapy relies on a change in tumour size which does not always correlate with the change in amount of viable tumour. Newer techniques such as functional MRI microbubble and optoacoustic ultrasound offer the potential to detect responses to chemotherapy by evaluating functional changes in tumour vascularity and oxygenation. Neither modality utilises ionising radiation. Although MRI is widely used for detecting breast cancer its ability in assessing functional responses to chemotherapy prior to surgery has not been fully exploited. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI has a sensitivity around 90% and provides quantitative measurements of blood volume and flow. Other functional techniques detect variation in tissue oxygenation: this is called the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) mechanism. The BOLD technique uses a special magnetic resonance (MR) sequence called T2* to measure the weakly magnetic effect of deoxygenated haemoglobin. The investigators wish to develop and validate T2* measurements which relate to oxygenation of a tumour. The investigators also want to validate other MR sequences including diffusion weighted (DW) MRI which quantifies microcirculation of blood in the capillary network and the diffusion of water within tissues. Microbubble ultrasound is an established technique that utilises an intravenous contrast agent comprising tiny microbubbles of gas that can increase the reflectivity of blood and enhance spectral and colour Doppler signals obtained from routine ultrasound imaging. Optoacoustic imaging is new technique where the output signal depends on the oxygenation of the tissues under study. It utilises a light signal input and measures ultrasound signal output. The investigators want to correlate our imaging findings with histopathology after surgical resection of the tumour.    ,NCT02688257
Breast Cancer,Post-Mastectomy Surveillance to Detect Recurrence in Breast Cancer Patients, Currently there is no standard recommendation for using imaging studies to check patients for breast cancer recurrence who have been treated with mastectomy. The investigator proposes performing in-office ultrasound examinations of these patients to determine if this would be helpful in identifying an expected 5-7% of patients with breast cancer recurrences following mastectomy.    ,NCT02688725
Breast Cancer,Multicentre Study to Determine the Feasibility of Using an Integrated Consent Model to Compare Three Standard of Care Regimens for The Treatment of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer in the Neoadjuvant/Adjuvant Setting (REaCT-TNBC)," Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a term applied to breast cancer cases that have <1% expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) and do not over express HER2. TNBC is diagnosed in 15-20% of breast cancer cases and tends to occur in younger women and have biologically more aggressive high grade disease. Clinically patients with TNBC have a poorer prognosis compared to patients diagnosed with other breast cancer subtypes. Because of the aggressive phenotype and due to observations that systemic chemotherapy offers significantly higher benefit in ER negative disease current treatment guidelines from provincial and other organizations recommend that patients receive adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for any TNBC greater than 0.5 cm in greatest diameter or node positive independent of primary tumor size. Currently there is no world-wide standard recommended chemotherapy regimen for the management of TNBC in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting with treatments varying from region and institution. As physicians do not know what the ""best"" treatment for patients is genuine uncertainty (""clinical equipoise"") exists. Physicians will choose between different ""standards"" in their personal practice using idiosyncratic decision making processes without the physician or the patient knowing the optimal option. This is not good for patients physicians and society as a whole. Determining the optimal treatment remains an important medical issue for patients physicians and society. This study will survey opinions on a novel method to allow comparisons of established standard of care prophylactic treatment using the ""integrated consent model"" as part of a pragmatic clinical trial and attempt to compare head to head standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with TNBC.

Breast Cancer,An Integrated Consent Model Study to Compare Two Standard of Care Schedules for Monitoring Cardiac Function in Patients Receiving Trastuzumab for Early Stage Breast Cancer," Several large adjuvant trastuzumab trials have demonstrated improved overall survival in participants with early stage breast cancer with a 33% decrease in risk of death. However retrospective analyses of participant outcomes in these trials have demonstrated increased risk of cardiotoxicity (i.e damage to the heart) in a small number of patients (4-8%). At this time investigators are unable to predict which participants are at increased risk of cardiac-related treatment complications. Currently all patients receive regular cardiac imaging throughout their one year of trastuzumab treatment. At this time the optimal monitoring schedule for trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity remains unknown and several published consensus guidelines are currently in use as ""standard of care.

In turn the activities of these immune cells could work with anti-cancer therapies to make them more or less effective.    ,NCT02696759
Breast Cancer,FDHT PET and Bicalutamide in Metastatic Breast Cancer, Rationale: The purpose is to evaluate whether non-invasive in vivo imaging of androgen receptor (AR) presence in metastatic breast cancer patients by means of 18F-fluoro-dihydrotestosterone positron emission tomography (FDHT-PET) can be used to predict (early) treatment response to and optimal dosing of the anti androgen bicalutamide. The ultimate goal is to contribute to optimal selection of breast cancer patients for anti androgen treatment. Objective: Feasibility to detect a diffrence in uptake on 18F-FDHT scan after 6 weeks of treatment with bicalutamide in metastatic breast cancer patients. Secondary Objectives: to describe whether changes in 18F-FDHT tracer uptake after six weeks associates with response to bicalutamide to describe whether changes in AR availability are different for breast cancer subgroups during treatment with bicalutamide and to describe whether 18F-FDHT tracer uptake is influenced by the amount of AR tumor expression. Study design: This is a single arm one stage feasibility study which will be executed in the University Medical Center Groningen The Netherlands. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the difference in 18F-FDHT uptake in tumor lesions after 6 weeks of bicalutamide treatment in patients with AR-positive metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be treated with bicalutamide until progression or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. Study population: The investigators will include 20 postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients with an AR positive HER2 negative tumor. Patients should be restaged clinically with bone scintigraphy and CT scan within a 6 week timeframe of the PET examinations. Intervention: All patients will receive a baseline FDHT-PET scan and start with bicalutamide treatment 150mg daily. During follow-up patients will receive one FDHT-PET scan after 6 weeks. Treatment with bicalutamide will continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. Main study endpoint: The percent difference in 18F-FDHT uptake in tumor lesions after 6 weeks of monotherapy bicalutamide. A minimum decrease of 20% in 18F-FDHT uptake after 6 weeks compared to baseline uptake with an α of 0.05 and a power of 80% is considered clinical significant.    ,NCT02697032

Breast Cancer,Role of Geriatric Intervention in Treatment of Older Patients With Cancer (PREPARE), Randomized trials have already demonstrated that geriatric intervention was able to improve survival in the general elderly population but only a few have been performed in cancer patients. At the end these data are not sufficient to consider geriatric intervention as validated in this setting. Case Management coordinated by a geriatrician and a trained nurse could improve prognosis of elderly patients with cancer. This approach can be integrated in daily oncology practice. This strategy will be compared to usual oncological management in a randomized phase III trial.    ,NCT02704832
Breast Cancer,Imaging the Patterns of Breast Cancer Early Metastases, Currently once a distant breast metastasis has been diagnosed 65% of patients will succumb to their cancer within 2 years and 80% will succumb by 5 years. The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer do not recommend surveillance imaging for earlier detection of distant metastases even for high-risk breast cancer patients. Whereas the standard-of-care treatment of the small isolated (few in number) breast cancer metastases is to perform surgical resection or locally ablative radiation therapy however the follow-up of breast cancer patients (including those with a >= 30% risk of developing metastases) is to wait for clinical symptoms to appear before using a dual positron emission tomography (PET) and diagnostic quality computed tomography (CT) PET/CT scan magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) computed tomography (CT) or a bone scan to identify the site and extent of spread. Unfortunately once metastases become symptomatic they are often too large and/or numerous to treat with curative intent. The current national care guidelines that advocate against intensive surveillance for distant metastases are based on two studies performed in Italy from 1985-1993 that concluded that the available imaging and treatment tools of the day did not prolong 5-year survival. Since then however there have been major improvements in imaging and treatment technology. To be treatable the metastases must be limited in number and limited in size typically 6 or fewer metastases each of size 5 centimeter or less. This state of metastatic presentation is called oligometastases. Numerous pilot studies have achieved dramatically improved overall and disease-free survival when oligometastases are treated using a combined systemic plus locally-ablative therapy of each oligometastasis. A scientific concern with the aforementioned research studies involving ablation of isolated oligometastases was that they were not carried out with consistent use of surveillance imaging. Instead these studies effectively preselected patients for enrollment based upon having an existing oligometastatic presentation. The primary objectives of the research study are to: (1) determine the feasibility of the stated interventions in a multi-institutional setting; (2) document the patterns of early metastatic spread of breast cancer; (3) document the proportion of high-risk breast cancer patients that have an oligometastatic presentation within this proactive imaging protocol and (4) provide a basis to determine how to optimize future surveillance imaging protocols with respect to the time to progression rate of tumor growth and organs that are affected.    ,NCT02706964

Breast Cancer,Prospective Study Evaluating the Use of PROSPECT to Reduce Insomnia in Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer, Women with early stage breast cancer may experience difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. If this occurs for more than 4 weeks these participants may have chronic insomnia. Chronic insomnia can lead to difficulty coping with stress changes in mood increased use of medications for sleep and an overall decrease in quality of life. The investigators have developed an internet-based website that is designed to help people manage symptoms typically experienced by breast cancer survivors including insomnia fatigue pain and overall poor quality of life. The investigators want to learn whether this type of treatment can reduce chronic insomnia and improve the way subjects feel using both questionnaires and a special form of a wrist watch. This information may help the investigators better manage sleep difficulties in subjects who experience these symptoms after diagnosis of their breast cancer.    ,NCT02712437

Breast Cancer,Body Composition and White Adipose Tissue Inflammation, The investigators want to find a better way to predict the risk of having fatty tissue inflammation by using a different approach to finding out body fat composition. In this study the investigators want to estimate the body fat composition using a DEXA scan. DEXA stands for dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. It is the standard and established test to determine bone mineral density (how strong the bones are) to diagnose osteoporosis. This test can also be used to determine the body composition including percent body fat and lean mass. The investigators will compare the participants DEXA scan results for body fat composition to the inflammation found in the breast tissue from the mastectomy to see if there is a relationship. If successful this may help us predict which patients may be at risk for breast cancer in the future. In addition the investigators will compare the participants DEXA scan results for body fat composition and inflammation found in the fat tissue from the mastectomy or prostatectomy to the level of exercise activity as measured by a short questionnaire to see if there is a relationship. The investigators will also measure the participants waist to hip ratio. Finally at the time the participant has blood drawn for their standard presurgical testing the investigators will also test the blood for prediabetes using a blood test called hemoglocin A1c. The investigators will also measure for the participants waist to hip ratio and a Hgb A1c blood drawn will be take at the time of presurgical testing. If not feasible Hgb A1c can be drawn at a separate visit prior to the DEXA scan. If successful this may help us predict which patients may be at risk for breast cancer in the future.    ,NCT02713022

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Impact of Nitrous Oxide on PONV in Breast Surgeries, Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is considered one of the most unpleasant postoperative discomforts and lead to serious complications of aspiration of gastric contents suture dehiscence esophageal rupture subcutaneous emphysema or pneumothorax. The incidence of PONV is 30-40% in normal population and touches a peak of 75-80% in certain high-risk groups. PONV is associated with delayed recovery and prolonged hospital stay and is associated with significant morbidity. It may also result in delayed discharge which is particularly significant after potentially ambulatory surgery. Women are 2 to 3 times more susceptible to PONV than men and breast surgery which is primarily done in an outpatient setting is associated with high incidence of PONV ranging between 15% and 84% in the absence of prophylactic treatment. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has analgesic and sedative properties but may potentially increase the incidence of PONV. N2O might increase the incidence of PONV by several potential mechanisms: (1) increase in middle ear pressure (2) bowel distension (3) activation of the dopaminergic system in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and (4) interaction with opioid receptors. N2O has been demonstrated to increase the incidence of PONV in some studies but not in others. The present study is undertaken to evaluate the effect of nitrous oxide- free general anesthesia on the undesirable clinical outcome of PONV.    ,NCT02736604

Physical activity interventions have shown effectiveness in helping breast cancer survivors increase physical activity during treatment but limited evidence-based physical activity interventions have been incorporated into the clinic and community. To address this limitation the investigators are partnering with the UTMB breast cancer support group to conduct a 12-week physical activity intervention Pink Warrior. The goal of this study is to compare an intervention that uses active games versus an intervention uses pedometer to encourage physical activity such as walking within breast cancer survivors in active cancer treatment. The study will include breast cancer survivor between the ages of 18 - 70 whom currently gets less than 150 minutes of planned physical activity per week and received a breast cancer diagnosis within 0 to 6 months. Participants will be randomized to participate in the support group using the active video game-based physical activity intervention (Wii and Xbox active games) or to participate in the existing UTMB breast cancer support group with pedometers (Digi-Walker CW-700/701). The investigators hypothesize that by engaging in active video gaming breast cancer survivors will be motivated to initiate and maintain physical activity during treatment. This will ultimately increase functional capacity and prevent functional disability in breast cancer survivors.    ,NCT02750241

Breast Cancer,Study of Apatinib Combined With Oral Vinorelbine in Metastatic HER2 Negative Breast Cancer, Apatinib is an orally administered second-generation blocker of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). A prospective open label phase II multicenter trial of apatinib in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer demonstrated that the daily dose of apatinib 500 mg/day is active in pretreated metastatic TNBC with encouraging rates of disease stabilization and PFS. Vinorelbine is a highly active drug in the treatment of MBC both as a single agent or in combination regimens and is well tolerated with a low incidence of severe toxicity. Clinical trials demonstrated oral NVB provided comparable effectiveness to iv NVB. and oral availability allows using different schedules. The NCCN guideline introduces that combination chemotherapy is one of the standard treatment options in metastatic breast cancer especially in patients with visceral metastases and/or need of rapid symptom or disease control. Theoretically anti-angiogenesis regimen combined with chemotherapy may present increasing therapeutic effect. Related researches are urgently needed to find optimal combined therapy.    ,NCT02768415

Breast Cancer,Primary Radiotherapy And DIEP flAp Reconstruction Trial, Many women with breast cancer now live for decades after their breast cancer treatment. In view of this modern breast reconstruction surgery after mastectomy for breast cancer aims to reproduce as natural a breast shape as possible. Keeping a natural breast appearance has been shown to be very important to a woman's emotional and psychological recovery. Breast cancer treatment often includes a combination of surgery chemotherapy radiotherapy anticancer tablets such as Tamoxifen and newer targeted drugs such as Herceptin. Radiotherapy is usually given after surgery. However radiotherapy after mastectomy and breast reconstruction can damage the 'new' breast giving a less good breast shape and appearance in the longer term. Also if recovery is slow following surgery the radiotherapy is delayed which may reduce its effectiveness. Changing the order of treatments has been shown to be safe and effective for chemotherapy Herceptin and anticancer tablets but we have very little information on giving radiotherapy before breast cancer surgery. The investigators want to find out if giving radiotherapy before mastectomy and reconstruction alters surgical complication rates and they want to evaluate the appearance of the reconstructed breast when radiotherapy is given before surgery.    ,NCT02771938
Breast Cancer,Generation of Heart Muscle Cells From Skin Cells of Breast Cancer Patients, The purpose of this study is to investigate whether cells from a biopsy taken from the patient skin can be transformed into cardiomyocytes the changes in cardiomyocyte (heart muscle cells) when grown in a special culture medium outside of the body. The structure and function of these cells will then be studied to determine why some patients with breast cancer who are treated with chemotherapy including anthracycline (e.g. Doxorubicin) and anti-HER2 therapy (e.g. Herceptin) develop decreased heart function.    ,NCT02772367
Breast Cancer,Shave Margins vs. Standard Partial Mastectomy in Breast Cancer Patients," Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women in the US. Surgical management is the mainstay of therapy and in general consists of resection of the primary tumor with either a partial mastectomy (aka ""lumpectomy"") or a total mastectomy. The investigators hypothesize that routine shave margins during partial mastectomy will significantly reduce positive margin rate. A positive margin means that cancerous cells were detected at the edge of the excised area. This generally mandates a return to the operating room for re-excision.    ",NCT02772731
Breast Cancer,Prospective Study Assessing EndoPredict® Genomic Test Impact on Shared Decision of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With ER-positive Her2-negative Early Breast Cancer, The trial population of this study is composed of women aged more than 18 who have developed a newly node-negative (or pN1mi) Estrogen Receptor (ER)-positive Her2-negative invasive breast cancer with uncertainty on the indication of adjuvant chemotherapy using standard assessments. Obtaining material for test is at no risk as done from the surgery material. Tumor molecular EndoPredict (EP)clin analysis will allow to obtain information on the expression of 8 breast cancer related genes and will provide important prognosis indications. Clinical validation studies have demonstrated that molecular assays are useful for stratifying patients into risk categories and helpful in making clinical treatment decisions in ER+/node-negative breast cancer patients.    ,NCT02773004
Breast Cancer,Does Intra-operative MarginProbe Use Reduce Re-excision Rates?, The new device we are looking at is called the MarginProbe. It is a disposable probe which measures the margins of tissue removed to check they are clear of cancer cells during breast conservation surgery. After specimen radiology allows the Surgeon to remove further tissue if necessary during the same operation if any involved margins are identified. This minimises the need for further repeat operations. Previous studies carried out elsewhere in the world (USA and Israel) have identified that the probe reduces re-excision rate but there has never been a study in the UK. The trial involves randomly allocating patients once they are in theatre to either the MarginProbe procedure after breast conserving surgery and radiology has been completed or not.    ,NCT02774785
Breast Cancer,Reducing Dexamethasone Around Docetaxel Infusion, The manufacturer recommends two different regimens of prophylactic dexamethasone to prevent hypersensitivity and fluid retention reactions caused by docetaxel: a 3-day regime of dexamethasone 8mg twice a day starting the day before chemotherapy for breast cancer and for prostate cancer 3 times 8mg dexamethasone on the day of docetaxel infusion given the concurrent use of prednisone 2dd5mg. There is little evidence that supports this high dose regimen used nowadays. There is need to re-evaluate this high dosage of dexamethasone for three main reasons. First dexamethasone can give side effects such as manifestation of latent diabetes mellitus immunosuppression personality changes irritability euphoria or mania and mood swings. Second dexamethasone is an immune suppressor which might inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and compromise the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. Third dexamethasone is a CYP3A4 inducer which might increase docetaxel clearance. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of reducing prophylactic of dexamethasone around docetaxel infusion.    ,NCT02776436
Breast Cancer,A Study of the MIRA System for Evaluating Women at High Risk of Breast Cancer, The purpose of the study is to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of cancer detection when the MIRA technology is combined with mammography in women above 30 years old who are undergoing screening mammography or are scheduled for image-guided needle biopsy due to lesions detected by other imaging modalities. The hypothesis is that breast cancer screening based on functional imaging will result in the early detection of breast cancers at times predating mammographic conspicuity. In addition breast cancer screening based on functional imaging will be unaffected by breast density. therefore the combination of anatomic screening (mammography) and functional imaging based screening (MIRA) will result in significantly higher breast cancer detection rates in women with dense breast tissue by indicating the need for additional breast imaging technology usually MRI.    ,NCT02777164

Breast Cancer,Talimogene Laherparepvec in Combination With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to determine if an oncolytic virus called Talimogene laherparepvec (a modified herpes simplex 1 virus that can specifically destroy cancer cells while leaving normal cells alone) injected directly into the tumor during chemotherapy prior to surgery can enhance the elimination of triple negative breast cancer tumors. The natural herpes simplex 1 virus typically causes cold sores around the mouth but the talimogene laherparepvec version of the herpes virus has been changed to prevent it from reproducing in normal tissue. However it can still attack and break open cancer tissue which is why it is used as a treatment for cancer. It is thought that this virus can also help recruit the participant's immune system to attack the cancer cells during their treatment and possibly destroy the tumor tissue more effectively than chemotherapy alone. This virus is already FDA approved to treat melanoma skin tumors so investigators want to determine if this virus can achieve a similar benefit in women with triple negative breast tumors.    ,NCT02779855

Breast Cancer,BrUOG 308: Efficacy of wPCbTP and Switching to an AC in Non-responding Patients as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Clinical Stage I-III HER2-positive Breast Cancer., Neoadjuvant therapy is given to breast cancer patients whose cancers are relatively large or have spread to lymph nodes or both. The primary goal of this treatment is to prevent the cancer from coming back (recurring) elsewhere in the body but if it makes the cancer in the breast and lymph nodes shrink it might be easier to remove. This could allow a patient to have a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy and reduce the number of lymph nodes that the surgeon has to remove. In some cases the neoadjuvant therapy works so well that it kills all of the cancer in the breast and lymph nodes. This is referred to as a pathologic complete response (pCR). Patients who achieve a pCR have a much lower risk of the cancer recurring elsewhere in their bodies. Investigators aren't sure which chemotherapy drugs work best with the HER2-targeted drugs and what combination of these drugs causes the fewest side effects.Thus this study has two main goals:   1. To find out if treatment with wPCbTP weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin given with trastuzumab and pertuzumab every 3 weeks leads to as many pCRs as TCHP in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer but has fewer side effects.   2. To find out if HER2-positive patients whose cancers are not responding well after 12 weeks of wPCbTP get a better response when they are switched to a doxorubicin-containing regimen called AC for 4 cycles (8-12 weeks).    ,NCT02789657
Breast Cancer,Dose-dense Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide With Intermittent Low-dose Sunitinib in Breast Cancer Patients, Background: The investigators previously studied the addition of low-dose short-course sunitinib to pre-operative chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with measurable primary breast tumor in a phase Ib/II study at the National University Cancer Institute Singapore. These data showed that the addition of sunitinib improved tumor vascularization as hypothesized with enhanced short-term treatment response. However pathological complete response rate after 4 cycles of chemotherapy was not superior to standard chemotherapy and may be attributed to dose delays from increased myelosuppression with the addition of sunitinib. The investigators hypothesize that this promising regimen may be further optimized with the use of growth factor support. The investigators thus plan to study the addition of low-dose shortcourse sunitinib to dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (ddAC) administered every 14 days supported by pegfilgrastim. Aim: To confirm that the addition of 12.5mg sunitinib for 5-7 days can be added before each cycle of ddAC (delivered every 14 days supported by pegfilgrastim) without compromising dose intensity in phase II open label single arm part of the study followed by a phase II randomized study to compare the pathological complete response rate of ddAC versus sunitinib + ddAC in stage I-III HER2 negative breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Methods:A single-centre study comprising two phases: a. Phase II open label single-arm study that will enroll newly diagnosed stage I-IV HER2 negative breast cancer patients receiving either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (stage I-III patients) or first-line palliative chemotherapy (stage IV patients). All patients will be treated with 4 cycles of ddAC at standard doses (60/600mg/m2) every 2 weeks supported by subcutaneous pegfilgrastim 6mg to be administered 24-36 hours after each dose of chemotherapy. Low dose sunitinib at 12.5mg daily orally will be administered for 7 days prior to cycle 1 ddAC and for 5 days prior to each subsequent cycle of ddAC. b. Phase II randomized study that will enroll newly diagnosed stage I-III HER2 negative breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy before definitive breast cancer surgery. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to 4 cycles of ddAC with or without intermittent sunitinib in patients with measurable primary breast cancer who are receiving preoperative chemotherapy.    ,NCT02790580

Breast Cancer,Exercise Program in Cancer and Cognition, This randomized control trial will examine whether a well-controlled and monitored site-based exercise intervention initiated before beginning aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy improves cognitive function in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer and will explore whether neuroimaging metrics of brain health pro-inflammatory biomarkers and symptoms (fatigue sleep problems depression anxiety) mediate the effects of exercise on cognitive function. Furthermore the study will explore whether the magnitude of the improvements in cognitive function are modified by estradiol levels.    ,NCT02793921
Breast Cancer,The HeartSpare Study (Stage I), Radiotherapy (RT) has a major curative role in women with early breast cancer and is recommended routinely after lumpectomy and selectively after mastectomy. It has contributed to a halving of breast cancer mortality in the UK over the last 2 decades despite ever-rising cancer incidence. RT in women with left-sided tumours often exposes the underlying heart to a damaging dose. The heart is very sensitive to RT and there were 1-2 deaths from heart disease for every 100 breast cancer patients treated during the 1960s-70s. The situation has improved in recent years but standard RT techniques still deliver significant radiation doses to heart tissue. Two potentially simple techniques reduce heart dose. In one women are taught to breathe in deeply and to hold their breath for about 20 seconds while RT is given. The downward movement of the diaphragm pulls the heart away from the RT beam. In the other technique women lie on their fronts instead of on their backs as they normally do for breast RT. In this position the breast falls away from the rib cage and reduces exposure of the heart. Neither technique is routinely available to women receiving breast RT in the UK for reasons that this research aims to address. The investigators need to: 1) confirm that patient position can be reproduced with millimetre precision every day using these techniques 2) minimise costs of equipment time and personnel required to support such techniques 3) select the most appropriate technique for different patients and 4) train staff in centres across the UK to deliver techniques safely and effectively. By addressing all of these issues the study aims ultimately to make heart-sparing RT available to all UK women that might benefit from treatment thereby significantly reducing the burden of heart disease in breast cancer survivors.    ,NCT02794324

Breast Cancer,Monitoring of Breast Cancers Treated by Neoadjuvant Therapy Via Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the method of choice in breast cancer to perform the loco-regional staging and direct the treatment. European Guidelines (EUSOMA) currently recommend MRI for initial evaluation and assessement of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response for breast cancer. The standard of care consists of realizing a MRI before the start of the NAC and another one after it's ended six months later. There is currently no consensus on the realization of an interval MRI for early assessment of the chemosensitivity of the tumor. It would allow though alterations in the therapeutic regimen in the event of a non response. Similarly there is no consensus on when this interval MRI should be performed. Some recent studies suggest that Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging is interesting for the evaluation of the early response. However these are preliminary studies with quantitative measures realized by the region of interest (ROI) method. A response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in elevated values of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC). The investigator's goal for this study is to evaluate the reliability of diffusion as tumor biomarker. Therefore they will study the quantitative analysis of the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance sequences in the pre-therapeutic assessment and the early and late follow-up of breast cancers under neoadjuvant treatment (chemotherapy hormonotherapy...) within the CHU Brugmann hospital. The results of this analysis will be compared with the MRI results obtained at the end of the treatment and with the histology of the initial biopsy and the surgical specimen. The expected benefits are:   -  to establish correlations between apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) values and histology   -  to observe changes in the ADC according to the type of response: ADC increase in the event of partial response ADC stability in the event of non response ADC decrease in the event of a progression absence of restriction in the event of a complete response.   -  to confirm that diffusion weighted MRI within a short interval (after one cure at one month) has a predictive value for the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response.    ,NCT02798484

Breast Cancer,ME-344 in Early HER2-negative Breast Cancer With Antiangiogenic-induced Mitochondrial Metabolism, Prospective randomized open label two arms phase 0 clinical trial. HER2-negative breast cancer patients recently diagnosed will be screened for trial participation. A biopsy will be scheduled the week prior to or the same day as the FDG PET. Paraffin-embedded tumor samples will be used to evaluate the stainings of Ki67 cleaved caspase-3 and microvessels and frozen tumor samples will be used to evaluate SDH staining. The FDG-PET will be followed by the bevacizumab dose (15 mg/kg IV single dose). After one week the PET will be repeated in order to detect the patients that have experienced FDG uptake decay. Right after treatment with ME-344 (arm 1) or no treatment (arm 2) will start. ME-344 will be administered at 10 mg/kg on day 8 15 and 22. Surgery will be performed on day 28 (thus 4 weeks after the bevacizumab dose which is considered a safe window for antiangiogenics). Fragments of the surgical specimen will be collected. Paraffin-embedded tumor sample will be used to repeat (and compare) the stainings of Ki67 cleaved caspase-3 and microvessels and frozen tumor sample will be used to repeat (and compare) SDH staining.

Breast Cancer,Dried Blood SPOT Analysis of Everolimus in Cancer Patients (SPOT-study), Everolimus shows a large interpatient variability with fixed dose administration. These very different exposure levels between individuals can result in supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic exposure levels and consequently in over- or undertreatment respectively. Dose individualization based on the measured drug concentration could theoretically result in less toxicity and more efficacy. Nowadays everolimus exposure is determined by everolimus concentration in whole blood. Therefore a vena puncture is always necessary. This is invasive and requires patients to come to the hospital. It would be convenient for patients to have their everolimus blood concentration determined by dried blood spot (DBS) analysis. With DBS only a single drop of blood from the finger is necessary which can be done at home and sent by regular mail for analysis. Previous studies have shown the feasibility of this approach. In patients with cancer treated with everolimus 10mg once daily the correlation between everolimus DBS concentrations and whole blood concentration is yet unknown. Therefore the investigators want to determine the everolimus concentration collected with DBS from a finger prick with everolimus concentration from whole blood and everolimus concentration collected with DBS from whole blood. In addition possibly a relatively high everolimus concentration in saliva could be correlated with the incidence and severity of oral mucositis. Determination of drug concentration in saliva has also been proven to be feasible before. Therefore in this study the investigators want to determine whether the everolimus concentration in saliva correlates with the incidence of oral mucositis and how everolimus concentration in saliva correlates with everolimus concentration in whole blood.    ,NCT02809404

Breast Cancer,Diffusion Tensor Breast MRI (DTI), The breast MRI is used in the preoperative scenario to evaluate the extension of a newly diagnosed breast cancer and to screen the contralateral breast. The scan consists of a series of images taken after the use of intravascular contrast media that may detect areas of enhancement that look malignant but are actually benign tissue producing a false positive result. The investigators aim to evaluate a novel MRI sequence of images that does not use contrast diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Addition of DTI sequence does not add significantly to the time of standard breast MRI exam. This novel technique provides improved detection of tissue microstructure and is able to differentiate malignant from benign tumor. Hence the investigators hypothesize that DTI may decrease the false positive rate when compared with standard dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI.    ,NCT02812589

Breast Cancer,PECI/SPB vs Intercostal Nerve Block for the Management of Postoperative Pain in Latissimus Dorsi Flap Reconstruction," Regional Anesthesia is a procedure in which numbing medication is injected around nerves that transmit pain from areas involved in a surgery. The objective is to block the nerves so a patient does not feel pain after surgery. Regional nerve blocks offer many advantages over traditional anesthetic techniques including faster recovery time fewer side effects and a dramatic reduction in post-surgical pain. The use of regional anesthesia in breast reconstructive surgery such as the latissimus dorsi flap has led to major improvements in patient care. Today the most common regional anesthetic used in latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction is the intercostal nerve block where numbing medication is injected around the nerves supplying the chest wall. While intercostal nerve blocks have been used successfully in breast surgery they do not provide a complete nerve block to the chest wall as there are some nerves that are unaccounted for in the block which can contribute to a patients pain after surgery. The mixed pectoral one / serratus plane block (PECI/SPB) block is another regional nerve block that has been successfully used by anesthesiologists at The Ottawa Hospital and offers a more complete pain blockade than the intercostal nerve block as it includes more nerves that supply the breast. In addition to this the intercostal nerve block is a so-called ""blind-technique"" compared to the PECI/SPB block which is more accurately guided by ultrasound. Blind techniques are associated with higher failure rates. Both the intercostal nerve block and the PECI/SPB nerve block have been used successfully at the Ottawa Hospital. In this study the investigators propose a prospective double blinded randomized controlled head to head comparison of the PECI/SPB and intercostal nerve block to determine which block is associated with the best pain blockade and patient satisfaction in lattissimus dorsi flap surgery.

Breast Cancer,Randomized Short-term Pre-surgical Study to Assess the Effects of Abemaciclib (LY2835219) in Early Breast Cancer Patients, Cyclins CDK4 / 6 are extensively involved in the proliferation and growth of numerous cancers including breast cancer. The objective of this study is to identify if a new preoperative oral treatment abemaciclib directed against the CDK / 6 compared to no treatment inhibits tumor growth or induced senescence (aging) tumor. This early study is offered to women who are going to be operated on for breast cancer with expression of hormone receptor (ER and / or PR). These women will have 3 chances to receive one for up to 14 days in the waiting period of their surgery abemaciclib as tablets. Other patients do not receive treatment. The decision to receive or no treatment will be done by a random computer draw. The drug's effectiveness will be evaluated primarily on the biological parameters of the tumor itself when comparing surgery to before treatment. These results biomarkers will allow us to better know how this treatment and eventually will be used in future to identify patients for whom treatment with abemaciclib more efficiency.

Breast Cancer,The Impact of Intravenous Anaesthesia on Angiogenesis in Patients With Breast Cancer (TIVA/TCI-BC), Because neoplastic disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and breast cancer is one of the most frequent neoplasia among women the possibility of influencing the evolution of patients starting from the moment of surgical intervention using a perianesthesic intervention is a scientific topic of high interest. The study will compare two anesthetic techniques and their efficiency in lowering the factors that can favorize the dissemination of neoplasia and their role in the prevention of postoperative pain. The serum level of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) will be determined before and after the surgical intervention after using two different types of anesthesia (inhalational and intravenous) and the immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) will be determined on the excised tissue. For the two different types of anesthesia a continuous infusion of lidocaine 1% will be associated. The study will compare the short-term and long term-outcome of the patients assigned the two different types of anesthesia and their immediate postoperative evolution .    ,NCT02839668
Breast Cancer,Utrecht Cohort for Multiple Breast Cancer Intervention Studies and Long-term Evaluation - The UMBRELLA Cohort, Due to better treatment options and earlier detection survival rates of patients with breast cancer continue to increase. As such (late) treatment toxicity (long-term) quality of life and the cosmetic outcome are becoming more important. Also many competing experimental interventions (e.g. treatment lifestyle interventions) for breast cancer are being developed all in need to be properly evaluated before being implemented in routine clinical care. Randomized Controlled Trials are the gold standard to do so but they have shown many challenges especially when applied in a cancer setting. The 'cohort multiple Randomized Controlled Trial (cmRCT)' design is a promising design for multiple (simultaneous) randomized evaluations of experimental interventions with potential for increased recruitment comparability and long-term outcomes as a standard. By setting up UMBRELLA as a prospective cohort according to the cmRCT design the investigators aim to:   -  provide an infrastructure for efficient fast and pragmatic evaluation and implementation of experimental interventions   -  gain insight into short and long-term treatment response toxicity complications quality of life and survival of patients with breast cancer.    ,NCT02839863

Before during and after the 8-week intervention participants will be asked to complete surveys.    ,NCT02840344
Breast Cancer,Osteopathy and Prevention of Gastrointestinal Side Effects in Women Treated for Breast Cancer, Adjuvant chemotherapy with the protocol 3 cure of 5-FU + Epirubicine + Cyclophosphamide (FEC100) and 3 cure of Taxotere is a standard treatment in the management of patients with breast cancer and in adjuvant situation. The efficacy of 3 FEC100 and 3 Taxotere protocol in adjuvant situation for women treated for breast cancer is associated with several invalidating side effects for the quality of life of patients. 92% of women treated will present gastrointestinal toxicities of any grade. 11% will present nausea and vomiting of grade 3-4. Current treatments to prevent these gastrointestinal toxicities include Emend from Day 1 to Day 3 in association with setrons at Day 1 and corticosteroids from Day 1 to Day 3. Despite the marked improvement in gastrointestinal toxicities with preventive treatments 83% of patients would use alternatives medicine: homeopathy herbal medicine acupuncture hypnotherapy and / or osteopathy. Osteopathy is a method of care and unconventional therapeutic approach. In France the professional title of osteopath is recognized. It aims to prevent and treat functional disorders especially those related to adverse effects of treatment. In oncology this discipline may have additional support for the patient by limiting the mechanical and physical constraints of sensitive areas to the toxicity of the treatment. In the case of gastrointestinal toxicities of myofascial and musculoskeletal techniques are used in abdominal areas to relieve symptoms. The investigators hypothesis is that osteopathy could have an interest in the management of gastrointestinal toxicities related to chemotherapy in women with breast cancer and in adjuvant treatment situation.    ,NCT02840890
Breast Cancer,Evaluation and Modeling of the G-CSF Effect on the Evolution of Neutrophils During Chemotherapy Based on Eribulin, The anti-cancer cytotoxic chemotherapy is often the cause of neutropenia of grade IV or febrile neutropenia. Those neutropenia in addition to being a comorbidity factor result in dose reductions and/or temporary or permanent stop of chemotherapy thus impacting clinical response. To avoid those episodes or to shorten the duration and reduce the associated risk administration of Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) is recommended. Recombinant G-CSF reproduces the physiological effects of endogenous G-CSF by increasing the proliferation of granulocytes progenitors. Different forms of G-CSF are available: daily administration (such as filgrastim lenograstim) and a single administration (pegfilgrastim). Various international learned societies offer recommendations for primary care secondary or curative neutropenia induced by chemotherapy based on G-CSF. However guidance on the ideal time for the administration of growth factors and duration of administration are not very clear. If it seems clear that the treatment should not be initiated within the first 24 hours following administration of chemotherapy summaries of the characteristics of different products do not provide evidence to optimize the administration day depending on the kinetics evolution of neutrophils. In addition no information is given as to the choice of a formulation with respect to the other. The pilot study the investigator propose aims to model the effect of exogenous G-CSF on the evolution of neutrophil function of time and explain the pharmacodynamic variability during the administration of chemotherapy based on eribulin. The description of the evolution of neutrophils when growth factors are administered give the opportunity to streamline administration regimens of these factors and to provide guidance on the circumstances in which they should or should not be given while weekly chemotherapy. Expected benefits and foreseeable risks With the exception of surplus withdrawals during the first 2 cycles of treatment this study will have no impact on the care of patients.    ,NCT02841722

Breast Cancer,Feasibility of Quality of Life Assessment in Routine Clinical Oncology Practice at the University Hospital of Besancon, Symptoms related to the disease and/or treatment are common in cancer patients and can affect patient health-related quality of life (HRQol). Unfortunately these symptoms can be underestimated and underreported by the physician. Measure of the HRQoL has been significantly developed in clinical trials and has become a key endpoint to assess clinical benefit of new therapeutic strategies and as prognostic factor of overall survival for several cancer as in women breast cancer glioblastomas metastatic colorectal cancer prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover a recent study conducted in patients receiving routine outpatient chemotherapy for advanced solid tumors showed that clinical benefits were associated with symptom self-reporting during cancer care including the improvement of the overall survival. The aim of the QOLIBRY project is to introduce the collection of HRQoL of cancer patients in daily clinical practice in the University Hospital of Besançon. Indeed the goal is to make the HRQoL data accessible and exploitable in real time to physician to help medical professionals to optimize their practices by adopting a holistic and personalized approach based on the perception of the patients of their HRQoL and symptoms.    ,NCT02844608

Breast Cancer,Improving Adherence to EHT Among Breast Cancer Patients, Adjuvant endocrine hormonal therapy (EHT) is highly effective and appropriate for nearly all breast cancer patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors which represent 75% of all breast cancer diagnoses. Long-term use of EHT reduces cancer recurrence rates and cuts the risk of death nearly in half during the second decade after diagnosis research shows. Despite the proven benefits about 33% of women who are prescribed EHT do not take their medication as prescribed (less than 80% take their daily dosage) and are thus at higher risk of recurrence and death. This educational randomized controlled study will develop and pilot-test a bilingual culturally tailored personalized interactive mobile application (app) in combination with patient navigation to promote and improve adherence to endocrine hormonal therapy (EHT) among breast cancer patients.    ,NCT02850939

Breast Cancer,Feasibility Study of Accelerated Preoperative Radiotherapy for Early Breast Cancer, The standard treatment for women with a relatively small breast cancer without arguments for involvement of the axillary lymph nodes is breast conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy of the whole breast often with a complementary dose to the operated area (boost). A delay of 3-4 weeks after surgery is advisable for allowing wound healing before the start of radiotherapy. Historically whole breast radiotherapy plus boost are delivered in 6-7 weeks. This treatment can be associated with temporary fatigue and decrease in quality of life. Randomized trials have shown that shorter schedules delivering slightly more dose per day during 3 weeks are equal to the long schedules. In an earlier clinical study the investigators have tested such a short schedule and shown that it is equally safe and equally well tolerated as the conventional schemes. Other hospitals have examined (and still are examining) the safety and tolerance of even shorter schedules delivering radiotherapy in 1 week. This clinical study involves delivering radiotherapy in 1 week and before the surgery in stead of following surgery. In the postoperative setting it is often debatable which volume should be included in the boost. Often boost-volumes remain large because of uncertainties in delineation. Preoperative radiotherapy has the advantage that the tumor is visible on imaging. This can result in smaller boost volumes. The surgery will follow shortly after termination of the radiotherapy resulting in a very short treatment period. This study is an open study investigating the effect on quality of life of a very short preoperative radiotherapy for early breast cancer.    ,NCT02858934
Breast Cancer,Collaborative Network to Take Responsibility for Oral Anticancer Therapy, This study aims to develop implement and evaluate a care pathway for patients with cancer who are treated with oral anticancer drugs (OACD). The care pathway will be developed in six hospitals in Flanders and will be adapted to the local setting and situation. The investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a care pathway will increase the quality of the drug therapy the communication between health care professionals (HCPs) and patients and will lead to an improved level of self-management and adherence. Moreover the invesitgators hypothesize that the care pathway will facilitate the communication between HCPs in the hospital setting and in ambulatory care and will improve counseling skills self-efficacy and self-confidence of HCPs. At the end of the study a roadmap for the nation-wide implementation of a similar care pathway will be constructed based on the experiences of the participating hospitals. This roadmap will certainly include an e-learning platform for healthcare professionals.    ,NCT02861209
Breast Cancer,Individualised Versus Standard Care for Breast Cancer Patients at High-risk for Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting The ILIAD Study, The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether adding olanzapine 5mg to standard antiemetic medication can significantly reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy regimens such as anthracycline with cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. To help clinicians prescribe antiemetic medications in a more patient-centered evidence-based and cost-effective manner we've developed the world's first validated risk-stratification tool for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and because of this it is now possible to perform a trial of personalized precision antiemetic therapy for breast cancer patients. Despite widespread antiemetic use chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains among the most feared and expected side effects of chemotherapy for breast cancer. Inadequately controlled CINV can significantly reduce a patient's quality of life impair functional activity lead to chemotherapy dose delays and reductions and even discontinuation of treatment. The merit of current antiemetic medications is based on their ability to control chemotherapy-induced vomiting but not necessarily nausea and nausea is the major issue for breast cancer patients. With olanzapine demonstrating significant promise in preventing acute and delayed nausea the investigators are proposing to evaluate guideline-recommended aprepitant-based triple regimen compared to the same regimen plus olanzapine (5 mg) for patients at high personal risk for CINV. For patients at low personal risk for CINV the investigators will also evaluate guideline-recommended double antiemetic regimen compared to the same regimen plus olanzapine (5 mg).    ,NCT02861859

Breast Cancer,From the Characterization of the Cholesterol-epoxide Pathway Deregulation to New Therapeutic Perspectives in Breast Cancers," The main objective of our project is to further characterize the deregulation of CE (Cholesterol Epoxides) metabolism in different moleculars subtypes of BC (BC=Breast Cancer) (luminal A and B HER2+ and triple negative). We will study not only the level of expression of the enzymes involved in this pathway by immuno-histochemistry all the enzymes involved were identified in our preclinical work (GSTA1 (Glutathione S-Transferase A1 ) DHCR7 D8D7I 11βHSD2 (11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of type 2 )) but also the metabolite rates of CE (hydrolyses cholesterols-56-epoxide ) CT (into cholestane-3β 5α 6β triol ) DDA (Dendrogenin A)and OCDO (6-oxo-cholestan-3β 5α-diol ). Our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of these dosages. We will also establish whether these deregulations are i) correlated with different histo-prognostic parameters (pN (N= Node) pT (T= Tumor)  EV TIL?? but also clinical ii) an independent prognostic parameter of BC in terms of disease-free survival metastasis-free survival and overall survival. The cohort consists of 350 cases of BC treated between 2009 and 2011 as well as all relevant clinical informations. In parallel we will continue our preclinical work by characterizing the targets and mechanisms of action of OCDO. Our preliminary results indicate that OCDO is a modulator of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) which could be target to inhibit this pathway. On the other hand we will characterize in the same manner as in human tumors the deregulations of the CE metabolism in vitro and in vivo (including xenografts in mice of human tumors in collaboration with Roman-Roman S) on a representative panel of BC molecular subtypes sensitive or not usually administered in clinical treatment and study the anti-tumor effect of various ""anti-OCDO"" therapies (therapies preventing its production such as Tam (tamoxifen) or DDA inhibitor of the enzyme producing OCDO or an inhibitor of the GR (glucocorticoid receptor )) alone or in combination with conventional therapies    ",NCT02863900
Breast Cancer,Feasibility Study of Breast MRI in Decubitus Position, Breast MRI is performed in prone position which causes a number of questions. Indeed the correlation with mammography and echography and the identification of preoperative lesions can be complex as echography and surgery are carried in supine position while mammography is performed in standing position. Moreover the prone position is often considered as uncomfortable by the patients. However there is few publications in the literature on breast MRI in decubitus position.    ,NCT02865239

Breast Cancer,Interest of Self-compression Technique on Tolerance of Mammography, Mammography is used for screening diagnosis therapeutic evaluation and monitoring of local cancer breast. It is sometimes poorly tolerated by some patients who complain of an uncomfortable examination or pain. Breast compression by the manipulator aims to reduce the thickness of the breast during mammography; This act is an important factor of pain or discomfort felt by the patient. But it is also an image quality factor. This study aimed to compare self-breast compression by the patient to the compression standard technique carried out by the manipulator.    ,NCT02866591
Breast Cancer,Evaluation of the Efficacy of Estramustine in Patient With Breast Cancer Progression After Treatment With Aromatase Inhibitor., Despite advances in early detection and treatment strategy about 25 to 40% of patients treated for breast cancer develop metastasis. Some patients are in a therapeutic impasse situation. It is therefore necessary to consider all possible options. The Estramustine showed encouraging results in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Given the clinical data the answer rate of Estramustine and its impact on progression free survival deserve to be studied in earlier clinical situation. This Phase II study evaluated the efficacy of Estramustine in women with breast cancer and metastates already treated with aromatase inhibitors and for whom this treatment has failed.    ,NCT02866955
Breast Cancer,Hypofractionated Radiation by CyberKnife as a Mean of the Tumor Site's Radiation After Conventional Breast Radiation., The CyberKnife (CK) has been developed recently. This is a linear accelerator carried by an industrial robot. It has due to its tumor tracking capabilities and high accuracy an interest in irradiation (boost) of tumor site after conventional irradiation. The radiation boost is currently issued by electrons protons or brachytherapy. These techniques require several fractions and are associated with cutaneous toxicities and aesthetic problems. CK has an interest in reducing the number of fractions and a reduction of dose delivered to the skin. CK has been used in a phase I protocol (CYBERNEO) with concomitant chemotherapy for inoperable breast tumors and has proven its effectiveness and safety of treatments. The investigator is considering conducting a Phase II protocol to a single dose of 8 Grays issued by CK for boost to the tumor site after conventional breast irradiation. The results in terms of local control will be evaluated on clinical monitoring.    ,NCT02867423

Breast Cancer,Does the Wording of Text Message Reminders Improve Uptake in Breast Screening?, Breast screening is a service offered by the NHS to help detect breast cancer and precancerous changes early at a time when treatment is more likely to be curative. An effective service must reach the 'at risk' but asymptomatic population. Breast screening uptake in London consistently falls below the national target and is well below the national average. Uptake in West London is particularly low with boroughs in Inner North West London having the some of lowest uptake rates in the country. Routine text message reminders have proven effective at improving uptake of breast screening appointments. However little attention is paid to the content of the messages. Previous studies of text message reminders in other clinical areas have shown that the content of these messages matters and some text messages are more effective than others. This protocol describes the design of a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of differently worded text messages on the engagement with breast screening in West London. Two intervention arms were designed taking into consideration results of a 1000 woman survey to highlight the behavioural barriers that most predict attendance. The survey tested 15 behavioural constructs and the two that most strongly predicted history of attendance were used to inform the text message content of the intervention arms for this trial. To this end this randomised controlled trial (RCT) will test the current standard practice text message reminder against two intervention text message trial arms informed by the above described survey. The setting is West of London Breast Screening Service and women aged 47-73 who are due for screening will be randomized to receive one of the three trial arms. The primary outcome is the difference in uptake between trial arms. Further statistical analysis will analyse the difference in uptake by age group deprivation score and previous attendance status. Result will inform how small changes to the word content may have significant effects on attendance at screening mammogram appointments.    ,NCT02872363
Breast Cancer,A Cohort Study to Evaluate Genetic Predictors of Aromatase Inhibitor Musculoskeletal Symptoms, Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers with 207090 new cases of breast cancer and 39840 deaths in women predicted for 2010 in the United States. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are used as first-line adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer. The effectiveness of current therapy is widely recognized to be compromised by poor compliance because of aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) a syndrome that affects up to 40-50% of women who take these medications. The syndrome that was not recognized during the registration trials for this class of drugs it can lead to discontinuation in up to 24% of women over 2 years. Knowledge that can be used to prevent discontinuation of these important agents because of severe AIMSS is urgently needed.    ,NCT02874222

Breast Cancer,Prospective and Retrospective Breast Cancer Database, In order to accelerate border crossing between basic research and clinical research in breast cancer it is necessary to easily use clinical and biological data. That is the reason why it is very important to create a clinical biological and pathologic beast cancer database mainly prospective but also retrospective. All data are from patients treated in Toulouse Centre. The scientific community will easily have access to clinical and biological informations through a centralized structured database  leading to optimize patients with breast cancer treatment.    ,NCT02884284
Breast Cancer,Cystic Breast Masses by Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS), The overarching goal of the proposed research is to evaluate whether qualitative and quantitative parameters in real time contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can aid in assessing suspicious indeterminate cystic appearing breast masses and ultimately determine whether or not an ultrasound guided biopsy is necessary. The underlying hypothesis is that breast masses (given BIRADS 4) that lack enhancement on CEUS will have a benign histology obtained by ultrasound guided core biopsy and/or surgery. Then in the future these non-enhancing cystic lesions can be followed and do not need biopsy intervention.    ,NCT02887937

Breast Cancer,Hong Kong Breast Cancer Study, Introduction: With population ageing and increasing Westernization breast cancer continues to be important health conditions among women in Hong Kong. Greater collaborative research efforts are needed to examine the questions about population screening for breast cancer the aetiology of such lesions and outcomes of breast cancer during survivorship period. There is a lack of locally-relevant models for assessing breast cancer risk. Contribution of novel genetic factors to breast cancer identification of the key and functional alleles in gene regions associated with risk of breast cancer as well as gene-environment interaction requires further investigation in Chinese population. Prognostic research studies in the West may not be readily applicable to the Chinese population. Objectives: We aim to investigate the aetiology and outcomes of breast cancer in local Chinese by using case-control and cohort study design in the health care setting in Hong Kong. We aim to examine potential risk factors/biomarkers (both traditional and novel) and to build infrastructure and biobank for breast cancer surveillance. We will follow up cases prospectively as a survivor cohort. Methods: A hospital-based case-control study and a prospective survivor cohort study will be conducted. Consecutive incident breast cancer and DCIS cases (n=3500) within a 24-month period in Hong Kong will be recruited from public hospitals private hospitals and private practices; and controls will be selected by frequency-matching on factors such as age and hospital/clinic setting. Cases will be prospectively followed up over a 2-year period and data collection will occur at baseline (within 24 weeks of diagnosis) 6 months 1 and 2 years following baseline assessment. Biologic samples (including both blood and tumour and normal breast tissue samples from the cases and blood samples from the controls) will be collected for later genetic and molecular study including WGS GWAS gene-environment interaction and molecular functional studies. Depending on availability of pathology samples and resources additional studies such as tissue microarray block production will be considered and performed in future. Data will be analysed by traditional regression EWAS and genetic association methods whenever relevant. Public Health Implications: The repository of clinical radiological and biological materials assembled through this case-control study will serve as a common publicly accessible platform for subsequent functional analysis and scientific interrogation. The case-control findings would offer an improved understanding to the state of the science on aetiology of breast cancer in Chinese women. In the genomics analysis potential refined classification of breast tumours may enhance our understanding detection and follow-up of such lesions as well as enable us to have more informed targeted and personalized treatment selection for our women population. The cohort study findings are important for developing an effective strategy for the improvement of overall survival and quality of life for the cancer survivors in Chinese population.    ,NCT02889458
Breast Cancer,Preservation of Fertility by Ovarian Stimulation Associated With Tamoxifen Prior Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer, The rates of patients with spontaneous pregnancies reported after breast cancer is between 3 and 7% particularly because of these treatments. Therefore it is essential to anticipate this problem by proposing the use of fertility preservation techniques for these young patients prior to any gonadotoxic treatment. PRESAGE study offers to patients fewer than 40 to preserve their fertility before neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of ovarian stimulation emergency order not to delay the start of treatment. This stimulation combined gonadotropin and tamoxifen followed by an oocyte retrieval. The patient may receive an oocyte vitrification and / or embryonic. This procedure is already done in many countries and by some French teams by combining tamoxifen or letrozole to the classic gonadotropin stimulation.    ,NCT02890082
Breast Cancer,Persistent Organic Pollutants and Breast Cancers (POPCASE), Exposure to certain classes of chemical contaminants including certain persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with a character of endocrine disruptors could be one of the factors that lead to increase incidence of breast cancer in the Western world . However the causal role of POPs in the onset of breast cancer remains nowadays unproven. Preliminary epidemiological studies on the impact of these environmental factors in breast cancer etiology have ignored the critical periods of exposure. Similarly they have considered a limited number of pollutants (not including possible joint or synergistic effects between individual compounds) and did not distinguish the different breast cancer subtypes may have different etiologies or even of genetic susceptibility factors (POP polymorphism of detoxification enzymes). Thus POPCASE study examines the association between the presence of breast cancer and the levels and exposure profiles to a group of POPs measured in adipose tissue (AT) and blood in particular using spectrometric methods developed by the team LABERCA (Nantes France). These internal levels of POPs (organochlorine pesticides dioxins PCBs brominated flame retardants) will be measured both quantitatively (tissue concentrations) and qualitative (relative proportions of different pollutants sought).    ,NCT02890095

Breast Cancer,Compare Outcomes Between Two Acellular Dermal Matrices, This study will evaluate the performance of Alloderm RTU medium (LifeCell) vs. Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis (RTI Surgical® Inc.). These are the thinnest versions of acellular dermal matrices (ADM) offered by both vendors and can be used for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. Alloderm RTU medium has a thickness of 1.6±0.4 mm while Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis has a thickness of 1.0±0.2 mm. In the context of breast reconstruction these ADMs are used in the same manner. They may be inserted with a tissue expander immediately after skin- or nipple-sparing mastectomy. The investigators will examine breast-reconstruction associated complication rates pre- and post-operative patient reported outcomes using the Breast Q and physician reimbursement as well as direct hospital costs. The endpoint will be either exchange of the tissue expander for a permanent breast implant or autologous flap explantation due to patient preference development of a complication or less common reasons. The investigators propose that Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis and Alloderm RTU will have equivalent complication and patient reported outcome rates as well as physician reimbursement but that direct hospital cost will be less with Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis.    ,NCT02891759

Breast Cancer,Longitudinal Study of Behavioral Changes Economic and Sociological After CAncer," Generally French studies concerned with the quality of life of cancer patients focus on the period of treatment (up to 2 years post diagnosis). However studies about quality of life ""after"" cancer are relatively rare (= long-term quality of life or from 5 years post diagnosis). These studies mainly concern the most common cancers (breast and prostate). Or changes in quality of life after treatment could be different depending on the type of cancer. In addition there is a significant influence of sociodemographic variables on the quality of life in remission. Similarly using remote diagnostics quality of life questionnaires related to health must be reassessed because too often developed for situations in process. Based on these findings ""ELCCA II"" study proposes to study for five years the evolution of the impacts of two types of cancer (breast and melanoma) on quality of life (overall and related to the subjective health) socioeconomic status and behavioral and emotional dimensions (post-traumatic development coping anxiety-depression) of those treated.

Breast Cancer,Chemotherapy Effect on Brain Structure Neurophysiology and Psychomotor Behavior in Breast Cancer Patients, Some cancer patients report experiencing mild problems with thinking during or following chemotherapy. Symptoms include problems concentrating slow thinking some gaps in memory and difficulty performing complex or multi-tasks. These symptoms often soon disappear after treatment. However for some patients they may persist for years and this can have a significant effect on their quality of life. The reasons for these symptoms are not well understood. This study proposes to examine the effects of chemotherapy on the brain and how the changes in the brain affect one's ability to move one's arms and fingers. By better understanding the negative consequences of chemotherapy on the brain and nervous system the hope is to help pharmaceutical companies develop safer cancer treatment drugs.    ,NCT02896504

Breast Cancer,Trial of Neoadjuvant Docetaxel ± Metronomic Capecitabine/CTX Followed by FEC in Women With Operable Triple Negative Breast Cancer, This multi-center open-label phase II randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy of docetaxel(T) combined with metronomic cyclophosphamide/capecitabine (mCX) followed by fluorouracil /epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) versus T followed by FEC as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in treating women with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and to study the anti-tumor immune effect of metronomic neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 186 stage M0 TNBC patients who had a primary tumor > 2cm by imaging or an axillary lymph node > 2cm by imaging are randomly enrolled to receive neoadjuvant T combined with mCX (3 cycles) followed by FEC (3 cycles) or T (3cycles) followed by FEC (3 cycles) before surgery. The primary end point is pathological complete response (pCR) rate and the secondary end points include: clinical response rate toxicities breast-conserving rate Ki67 and CD31 reduction rate changes in the percentages of peripheral blood or tumor microenvironmental regulatory T cells (Treg) T helper cells (Th) CD8+ T cell and tumor-specific CTL and changes in tumor microenvironmental immune cytokines. Once there is a significant statistical difference in terms of pCR rate between two groups 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and 3-year overall survival (OS) will be included in the secondary end points. The aims of this study are to determine whether the neoadjuvant T combined with metronomic CX followed by FEC can significantly increase the pCR rate in TNBC with acceptable toxicity and to explore the anti-tumor immune effect of metronomic neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    ,NCT02897050

Breast Cancer,Imaging Evaluation of the Therapeutic Response of Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis (EMOS), Breast cancers are among the cancers that metastasize the most to the skeleton. The appearance of bone metastasis whether they are initials or during a relapse is a turning point of the disease due to the additional morbidity they imply (pain pathologic fractures hypercalcaemia neurological compression etc.). A specific treatment of these metastasis is often undertaken usually a chemotherapy or hormone therapy. It is important to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment in order to know whether to continue or change it depending on the response observed. But there is no consensus at this time on paraclinical examinations enabling this monitoring. Also if some criteria for assessing bone metastasis in imaging and nuclear medicine (MDA PERCIST EORTC) have been published in the literature none is formally validated and evaluation in routine practice remains subjective. The main objective of our study is to determine if the PET-CT and the whole-body MRI are in agreement on the status of bone metastasis (stability progression partial response complete response).    ,NCT02900118
Breast Cancer,Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Program Combined With Endurance Exercise Training: a Help in Treatment for Breast Cancer?, Integrative approaches to promote wellness and reduce the distress associated with cancer are considered as essential components of cancer care. In case exercise training has been shown to produce many positive physiological and psychological benefits. Mindfulness-based stress reduction program shows similar beneficial effects and especially in emotional distress management. The aim of the study is to examine the cumulative effect of an 8 week-exercise-training program combined with an MBSR program on cardio-respiratory fitness and quality of life in women with breast cancer. These effects are thought to be mediated in part through changes in underlying brain processes that investigators will be put in light. Through telomerase activity oxidative stress mitochondrial respiration and blood cytokine level measurements investigators could expect to better understand the effect of these combined training in breast cancer.    ,NCT02900326

Breast Cancer,Ontario-wide Cancer TArgeted Nucleic Acid Evaluation, Substantial progress has been made in the treatment of cancer through the use of targeted therapies but what works for one patient might not work for another patient. Certain drugs are now being developed that target specific molecules in the body that are believed to be part of the disease. Biomarkers are specific characteristics of the cancer that may help provide prognostic information (e.g. how well patients will be regardless of the treatments given) or help predict sensitivity or resistance to a specific treatment. The study will collect archival tumor samples (previously collected biopsy or surgical tumor samples) to provide biomarker data about a patient's cancer which may help their physicians to identify which clinical trials of new drug treatments may be most appropriate for the patient in the future and may also guide the use of approved treatments that may potentially benefit the patient. Another goal of this study is to develop a province-wide registry of targeted gene sequencing testing results that will be made available to cancer researchers. Additional tumour tissue and blood samples collected from all study participants will also be stored in a biobank at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research for future research. The study will also look at linking data from this study to other health care databases to further collect information about the health care the patients received including medical tests clinic visits or procedures both before and after participating in this study. Having more information about patient health to relate to the DNA sequences may provide new insights into cancer and its treatment.    ,NCT02906943

This study will look at the efficacy of the drug crofelemer in preventing diarrhea in breast cancer patients.    ,NCT02910219
Breast Cancer,Pilot Study Evaluating the Oncogramme: Analysis of Response to Induction Treatment of Patients With Breast or Ovarian Cancer., The choice of treatments for cancers by systemic way - chemotherapy hormone therapy and targeted therapies - is currently defined by criteria for population groups and not to an individual. These expensive treatments - in financial terms and quality of life - will be effective for some and administered unnecessarily for other because there is no predictive test of response for a given individual. For breast cancer the usual treatment includes the first surgery and adjuvant therapies (chemotherapy hormonal therapy ...) whose effectiveness will be assessed after many years as the occurrence or not of a recurrence or metastases. These systemic treatments can also be administered before surgery to reduce the tumor volume and secondarily allow less mutilating surgery: it is the principle of treatment neo adjuvant. In this case the efficiency will be evaluated more quickly. In practice a patient with breast cancer suspicion has a biopsy which confirms the diagnosis and defined the parameters (hormone receptors cytological grade receptor monoclonal antibodies ...) that guide to the most appropriate type of treatment. Tumor size is evaluated in neo adjuvant pre-treatment by imaging: mammography ultrasound and MRI. At the end of this medication the evaluation of the response is achieved by radiology and surgery. Pathological examination evaluates and precise response by the criteria of Chevallier and / or Sataloff. An ex vivo test for predicting the response of cells to different chemotherapy regimens the oncogramme was developed by Oncomedics a young company whose technology is derived from the University of Limoges. Clinical response and / or histopathological could be compared in a reasonable time (2-6 months) the results of the oncogramme proposed by Oncomedics whether the efficiency obtained in vivo is that predicted by the ex vivo test. It is the same in the metastatic setting when there is an available target for biopsy and assessment of response. The management of ovarian cancer in advanced stages can also benefit from a radiological and histopathological evaluation strategy before and after systemic treatment to compare the in vivo results with those predicted by ex vivo by Oncomedics.    ,NCT02910622

Breast Cancer,Pre- Versus Postoperative Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation, Most of the local recurrences (LR) found after breast-conserving therapy are within or close to the tumor bed. This pattern of recurrence was confirmed by studies of breast conserving surgery without adjuvant irradiation and by the update of the NSABP B-06 trial. In the EORTC boost trial however 29% of all LR were found outside the area of the original tumor. Still a recent review of Breast Conserving Therapy (BCT) trials showed that the site of local recurrences after BCT was mostly in the tumor bed with less than 10% of LR elsewhere in the breast. This led to the concept of partial breast irradiation. With accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) a limited volume of breast tissue is irradiated allowing for a higher dose per fraction compared to whole breast irradiation (WBI) which is favorable considering the low alpha/beta ratio and thus higher sensitivity to high dose per fraction.    ,NCT02913729

Breast Cancer,Monitoring of Breast Cancers Treated by Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy Via Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the method of choice in breast cancer to perform the loco-regional staging and direct the treatment. European Guidelines (EUSOMA) currently recommend MRI for initial evaluation and assessement of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response for breast cancer. The standard of care consists of realizing a MRI before the start of the NAC and another one after it's ended six months later. There is currently no consensus on the realization of an interval MRI for early assessment of the chemosensitivity of the tumor. It would allow though alterations in the therapeutic regimen in the event of a non response. Similarly there is no consensus on when this interval MRI should be performed. Some recent studies suggest that Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging is interesting for the evaluation of the early response. However these are preliminary studies with quantitative measures realized by the region of interest (ROI) method. A response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in elevated values of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC). There is'nt any published data on the potential interest of breast MRI after a radiotherapy treatment and before the surgical treatment. Therefore the expected benefits of this study are:   -  to monitor the early modifications of the perfusion and diffusion parameters at the level of the tumor after radiotherapy and correlate them to the histology of the surgical monster.   -  to assess if MRI is able to objectivate the early signs of response after a radiotherapy neo-adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,The Development of a Personalized Decision Aid: Perspectives of Patients and Health Care Professionals on Shared Decision Making and Informational Needs on Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer, Background: The Dutch guideline on breast cancer treatment shows several grey areas where no clear recommendation is given on the radiotherapy options but where the advice is to discuss the treatment of choice with the patient. Currently patients are exposed to different information given by the professionals' personal styles of informing patients. The challenge for all oncological professionals is to give clear structured and neutral information on the pros and cons of the treatment option(s) in the context of the natural course of the disease to the patient; to elicit patients' needs and preferences. How and which information should be shared in a decision aid is up for investigation as well as how this should best be implemented. Research goals: Qualitative assessment of patients' and health care professionals' informational needs and perspectives on breast cancer radiotherapy and shard decision making. Methods: Semi-structured interviews will be held with both breast cancer patients and health care professionals. To reach as heterogeneous groups as possible patients of different ages with different education levels and who underwent different treatments or chose not to get radiotherapy at all will be selected . Data will be collected til saturation is reached. Interviews will be transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis.

Breast Cancer,Impact of Adapted Physical Activity on Cognitive Functions in Breast Cancer, Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women in western countries. The improvement of therapeutic management associated to the developement of supportive care allows patient to live longer in better conditions. But several studies have showed the deleterious impact of treatment such as chemotherapy on cognition. To limit these damages non therapeutic approaches such as Adapted Physical Activity (APA) have been developped. The goal of this study is to evaluate the benefit of APA program on cognitive functions in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.    ,NCT02934880
Breast Cancer,A Study on Optimizing Follow-up for Postmenopausal Women With Breast Cancer Treated With Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy, Background: In February 2015 the Danish Health and Medicines Authority published new clinical guidelines describing how cancer patients should be followed. It is recommended that patients receiving specific oncological treatment such as endocrine therapy be followed at the department of oncology responsible for the treatment and providing the medication. There is no evidence that routine examinations improve overall survival after breast cancer. Mammography is the only specific examination to be offered to asymptomatic women after treatment for breast cancer Aims of the study: Our hypothesis is that individualized follow-up with the introduction of Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) data will help postmenopausal women regain control of their health related self-care and encourage them to a larger extent to take part in their follow-up after cancer treatment. We believe this will improve the health related quality of life and increase the positive experience of the follow-up program. Design: Patients are randomly assigned to the department's standard control program or an individualized solution in the context of shared decision making. PRO data will be used to evaluate the patient's need for consultations. Primary outcome: Evaluation of the experience and feasibility of PRO data in connection with individualized follow-up of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Systematically applying PRO data we will uncover patient needs empower the patients to take part in shared decision making and improve the current follow-up in the sense of a more patient-centered care and tailored follow-up.    ,NCT02935920

Breast Cancer,Implementing Systematic Distress Screening in Breast Cancer, Many breast cancer patients experience psychological distress during their cancer care journey. There are effective treatments for breast cancer patients experiencing distress such as individual or group therapy health education and medication. Unfortunately clinicians may not be aware of the symptoms of distress in their breast cancer patients and some breast cancer patients who could benefit from referral to behavioral health specialists are overlooked. New guidelines recommend that all cancer patients be regularly screened for distress. However there are unanswered questions about the impact of distress screening conducted on such a large scale. Few studies have evaluated the impact of distress screening on important outcomes in breast cancer patients such as patient experience symptom management and use of health care services as compared to the usual care offered by the health care organization. In addition oncology clinicians are uncertain about the benefits of large-scale distress screening and pilot screening programs have not been uniformly successful particularly in the community oncology setting. The overarching goals of this study are to assess the effectiveness of implementing a guideline-recommended distress screening program for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients on improving identification and referral to treatment for highly distressed breast cancer patients to assess patient-reported outcomes health services utilization and implementation outcomes of the program. This study will address two main research questions: 1) Is a community-oncology based large-scale distress screening program more effective than usual care on improved identification of distressed patients referral to behavioral health services and patient-reported outcomes for breast cancer patients? 2) What are the barriers facilitators and other implementation-related outcomes related to distress screening in the community oncology setting?    ,NCT02941614

Breast Cancer,Care Coordination for Complex Cancer Survivors in an Integrated Safety Net System," Nearly 70% of people living with cancer are ""complex patients"" with multiple chronic conditions who must deal not only with effects of their cancer but also continuing diseases such as diabetes depression hypertension or heart disease. Care coordination strategies shown to be effective in improving outcomes for common medical conditions seen in primary care include: systematic transitions for patients to and from specialty care; intensive case management; and a team-based approach to comprehensive care. Despite an Institute of Medicine report suggesting these strategies as potential ways to improve care for cancer survivors their implementation has not yet been evaluated for cancer survivors. Parkland Health and Hospital Systems will be implementing care coordinator strategies as part of as quality assurance/quality improvement activities which Aim 2 and Aim 3 (research components) will evaluate. This protocol has been organized to reflect this distinction between the aims. The investigators expect no more than 1500 patients to be included in these study aims.    ",NCT02943265

Breast Cancer,Economic and Social Disparities and Breast Cancer, Precariousness is a multifactorial concept that can be broken down in the form of economic insecurity and / or social insecurity and / or territorial insecurity. Precariousness has an impact on health that is difficult to assess precisely because it also impacts on other factors that may themselves influence health. Therefore the understanding of the impact of precariousness on health involves studying individuals in their context. Our study is designed to assess the impact of precariousness on the history of breast cancer on care pathways on treatment and rehabilitation in a multidisciplinary contextual analysis. Indeed the socio -economic and geographical inequalities affect the history of breast cancer treatment and its delay and post- treatment rehabilitation. The main objective of this project is to compare the stage of disease at diagnosis (according to the TNM classification) in deprived and non deprived patients. The secondary objectives are to compare in the two groups - the socio-economic and geographical inequalities - the direct and indirect costs related to the management the out-of pocket costs and to describe based on individual inequalities identified the pathway of care of the patient. These objectives will be pursued in the framework of an observational cohort study prospective multicenter (Ile de France) comparative exposed / unexposed category. Each precarious patient will be matched to a non- precarious patient in the same age group regardless of the center. The study will include any patient resident in Ile de France seeking treatment for breast cancer regardless of the stage.    ,NCT02948478

Breast Cancer,A Home-Based Study to Enhance Activity in Breast Cancer Survivors, There is a well-documented association between physical activity & risk for breast cancer development and recurrence. It is known that exercise interventions have been effective at increasing physical activity levels in breast cancer survivors. Knowing that breast cancer survivors are less active than non-cancer patients a less active lifestyle places them at risk of obesity and poor overall health which in turn also increases risk of cancer and cancer recurrence. Not all the reasons for the risk reduction are clear however it is known that hormones and other inflammatory markers play a role. This study has three goals:   1. To investigate the feasibility of a home intervention designed to reduce sedentary behavior.   2. Describe the effects of the intervention on levels of sedentary behavior physical activity and symptoms.   3. Assess cost of the intervention.    ,NCT02969291

Breast Cancer,Exercise Interventions for Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, The BENEFIT-Study is a randomized controlled 3-arm intervention trial investigating the currently discussed hypothesis that exercise concomitant to chemotherapy (CTx) may have a beneficial effect on cancer prognosis by boosting the anti-tumoral effect of the cytostatics or by enhancing therapy compliance. This hypothesis is based on pre-clinical and exploratory clinical trials. Breast cancer patients scheduled for neoadjuvant CTx will be randomized to either a resistance training or an aerobic training concomitant to the neoadjuvant CTx or a waiting list control group that will get no exercise intervention during neoadjuvant CTx (i.e. usual care) but will exercise after breast surgery. The primary study endpoint is the clinical-pathologic stage (CPS-EG) score which has been shown to be a valid prognostic factor with respect to survival after neoadjuvant CTx and is routinely assessed after breast surgery. Further the effects of resistance and aerobic exercise on the pathological complete response (pCR) tolerability and compliance to CTx physical fitness patient reported outcomes such as fatigue sleep problems quality of life depressive symptoms anxiety and pain and selected biomarkers will be investigated. First an internal pilot phase of n=33 patients will be conducted. Upon the recruitment rate overall feasibility and funding it is planned that the study thereafter will directly continue as phase III trial (anticipated sample size n=342) possibly after some adaptions based on the experiences gained in the pilot phase. No interim analysis or unblinding of the pilot data is planned so that the pilot data can be integrated in the phase III study. A confirmation of the study hypothesis would be a strong argument for patients to engage in exercise as early as during neoadjuvant CTx. The trial will also provide evidence-based guidance for patients regarding type and timing of training.    ,NCT02999074

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of the Short Message Service Effectiveness in the Screening Invitation Strategy for Breast Cancer (USIMaPI), Each year in France breast cancer affects about 48000 women and is the first cause of cancer death in women with 11900 deaths estimated. Since 2004 there is a national organized breast cancer screening (OBCS) programme for asymptomatic women aged 50-74 and with a medium-risk. Every two years the local cancer screening department sends a personalized invitation mail to eligible women to perform a mammogram and a breast clinical examination. One to two reminder mails are sent to women who have not done the screening after an initial invitation. Despite this programme almost 47% of women in France do not participate to organized breast cancer screening. The Short Message Service (SMS) is an innovative communication tool in the field of health immediate reliable delivery low cost and ecological. The use of SMS could be an innovative low-cost personalized and ecological way to support the OBCS invitation strategy. The overall objective of this study is to preserve or even better increase participation in organized breast cancer screening while decreasing the associated costs by including SMS in our screening invitation procedure. Two SMS interventions will be tested which will correspond to different phases of the OBCS invitation procedure. This sequence of interventions leads us to perform three interlinked trials: a trial of superiority for the first phase (intervention 1: sending an SMS a few days before the initial mail invitation) then two non-inferiority trials for the second phase ( two trials=one for each context of phase 1 _ intervention 2: sending an SMS in place of the first postal reminder).    ,NCT03000920
Breast Cancer,To Evaluate the Safety Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of GDC-0077 Single Agent in Participants With Solid Tumors and in Combination With Endocrine and Targeted Therapies in Participants With Breast Cancer, This is an open-label multicenter Phase I study designed to evaluate the safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0077 administered orally as a single agent in participants with locally advanced or metastatic Phosphatidylinositol-45-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha (PIK3CA)-mutant solid tumors including breast cancer and in combination with standard-of-care endocrine and targeted therapies for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic PIK3CA-mutant hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,Alternative Dosing Schedule of Palbociclib in Metastatic Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer, The investigators propose to conduct a study to test an alternative dosing schedule of palbociclib. With the current three-week on and one week off schedule a significant number of patients develop grade 3 or higher degree of neutropenia and require dose reduction and sometimes discontinuation. This potentially compromises the efficacy of the drug. In addition as the half-life of palbociclib is 27 hours 1 week break with the standard 3 weeks on and 1 week off dosing schedule could potentially lead to recovery of Rb phosphorylation during the off week. Hence the investigators propose a 5 days on and 2 days off schedule each week without any weeks off drug. Although the cumulative doses each 28-day cycle is roughly the same with this schedule compared to conventional dosing the bone marrow is not exposed to the drug continuously for 21 days and rather gets frequent breaks from therapy. The investigators hypothesize that the 5 days on and 2 days off schedule is more tolerable with less frequent high grade neutropenia and dose interruption/reduction. In addition this schedule also provides for a more continuous drug delivery to the patient since there is not a week's break in therapy which could ultimately prove to be more efficacious.    ,NCT03007979

Breast Cancer,Tomosynthesis (TS) or Ultrasound (US) in Mammography-negative Dense Breasts (TOMUS). National Multicenter Trial, Breast cancer remains a worldwide big killer with a rate of deaths compared with newly diagnosed cases not lower than 20%. Mammography is the primary imaging modality for the early detection of clinically occult breast cancer. Mammography is established as the primary investigation for population-based breast cancer screening. Advances in mammographic technique regarding both hardware and software applications are still not sufficient to overcome mammography's limitation with regard to both sensitivity and specificity. Depending on several factors such as age and breast density mammography screening is associated with a false-negative rate of 10-20 %. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (TS) is a novel technique that is able to study the breast using 3D reconstructions of the tissue from multiple low-dose digital mammographic images acquired in several planes in a 15 to 50 degree angle. This process aims at a increasing the number of lesion visible due to the reduction of overlapping breast tissue. In TS to overcome these limitations a digital mammography (DM) unit is modified to allow the X-ray tube to move through a proscribed arc of excursion acquiring a fixed number of discrete projection images while the breast remains in compression. The individual projection images are extremely low in dose so the composite dose incurred during a TS acquisition may be similar to that of a standard 2D mammography. The radiologically dense breasts are associated with decreased sensitivity of mammography both in the clinical and screening setting as well as its established association with breast cancer risk. The systematic application of ultrasound (US) in women with radiologically dense breasts and negative mammogram has been shown to be associated with an additional cancer detection rate [789]. Incremental ultrasound detection of cancer may be considered in the range of 0.27% to 0.52% of ultrasound-screened women in different density categories [10]. In addition the main limitation of US in breast screening is represented by false- positive findings. These findings result in additional investigation or unnecessary surgical biopsy [10].    ,NCT03033030
Breast Cancer,Everolimus TDM to Predict Long Term Toxicity, Metastatic (HR-positive HER2-negative) breast cancer (BC) advanced or unresectable neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic (pNET) gastrointestinal or lung origin and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) are diseases with poor outcome. Everolimus increases patients' median progression-free survival (PFS) with 4.6 months in metastatic BC (mBC) 7 months in (p)NET and 3 months in mRCC. However serious adverse events (AEs) occur frequently. This reduces effectiveness of everolimus because AEs are managed with dose reductions treatment interruptions or even complete discontinuation of everolimus. Therapeutic-drug-monitoring (TDM) is used to adjust the prescribed daily dose to maintain effective everolimus whole blood concentrations with the lowest possible risk of AEs. While everolimus TDM has been common in transplantation medicine it has not been implemented in oncology. The importance of TDM in oncology is supported by previous research which showed that a 2-fold increased everolimus whole blood trough concentration was associated with a short-term risk of grade ??3 pneumonitis stomatitis and metabolic events. Moreover an exposure-toxicity relationship of everolimus in patients with thyroid cancer was observed since initial everolimus concentrations could be associated with early toxicity (< 12 weeks e.g. stomatitis). However the association between initial everolimus measurements and long-term AEs (??2 weeks e.g. pneumonitis anorexia and anemia) of any grade and the need for everolimus dose reductions could not be made. Since levels ±>18 µg/L were associated with toxicity the investigators assume that the upper therapeutic window of everolimus in the oncologic setting will be ±18 µg/L. Similarly a tendency to improved PFS and overall survival was observed when Cmin in steady state was above 14.1 μg/L. This seems to be the lower limit of the therapeutic window. Before consensus about the feasibility of everolimus TDM in the oncologic setting can be achieved a number of questions (the knowledge gaps) need to be answered: 1. It is unknown whether everolimus whole blood trough levels (over time) predict long-term AEs. 2.

Breast Cancer,The Effects of Anthracycline-based Chemotherapy on Peripheral Vascular Function, The overall goal of this project is to determine the effects of anti-cancer chemotherapy on reflex control of blood pressure and vascular function. Recent data have demonstrated that cardiovascular disease-related mortality is the 2nd cause of morbidity and mortality for 7-year cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy. This anti-cancer treatment-mediated cardiotoxicity is a progressive process that begins at the molecular level progresses to myocardial injury and left ventricular dysfunction cumulating as heart failure and cardiovascular disease-related mortality. In parallel to these cardiac-specific changes chemotherapy has also been shown to increase the risk for vascular-related abnormalities. However the impact of adjuvant treatments on the function and structure of the peripheral vascular system remains poorly understood. With normal aging two of the most important vascular adaptations to arteries which strongly contribute to the increased risk of vascular-related and general cardiovascular disease are an increase in large artery stiffness and dysfunction of the vascular endothelium. Therefore the overall goal of this project is to determine the effects of anthracycline-based chemotherapy on large and small artery function and structure. The central hypothesis is that this type of cancer therapy results in negative vascular consequences as determined by non-invasive evaluation of spontaneous blood pressure control carotid artery stiffness and vascular endothelium-dependent vasodilation. This observational study is designed to increase our understanding of the vascular changes that occur during and following anti-cancer chemotherapy and provide insight into new methods that will decrease cardiovascular disease risk in those treated for cancer.    ,NCT03062878

Breast Cancer,Impact of Radiotherapy on Patients Undergoing DIEP Flap Breast Reconstruction," The investigators intend to undertake a study to investigate the effect of radiotherapy on deep inferior epigastric perforator flap reconstructions (DIEP). Adjuvant post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) is offered to women at high risk of chest wall recurrence. The perceived detrimental effect of radiotherapy on an immediate breast reconstruction and the ""one-off"" nature of autologous reconstruction leads some surgeons to recommend delayed reconstruction after mastectomy or to use a temporising implant with a view to planned exchange to autologous reconstruction after radiotherapy. However there remains significant uncertainty in the literature about the impact of radiotherapy on autologous reconstructions. This study is a mixed methology study using patient reported outcome measures (PROMS) applanation tonometry (measure of breast compressibility) semi-structured interviews and 3 dimensional photography analysis to compare the aesthetic and impact on quality of life on the following groups of patients: Patient groups:   1. Unilateral skin sparing mastectomy (SSM) with immediate DIEP flap reconstruction and PMRT (cases)   2. Unilateral SSM with immediate DIEP flap reconstruction and no PMRT (controls)   3. Unilateral simple mastectomy PMRT and subsequent delayed DIEP flap reconstruction (controls)   4.

Breast Cancer,Bridging the Gap: Incorporating Exercise Evidence Into Clinical Practice in Breast Cancer Care in Ontario, Breast cancer (BC) and its treatments lead to numerous side effects that affect a person's life for years after treatment has ended. Research shows that regular exercise limits many of these side effects. However less than 30% of BC survivors regularly exercise due to many barriers that include patients being unaware of the benefits of exercise health professionals facing institutional personal and patient-related barriers to promoting exercise and a lack of knowledge translation (KT) strategies within cancer institutions that focus on accessible exercise interventions and education by physiotherapists. For this project a pilot study is needed as the first step in order to assess process and resource variables before implementation of a large-scale intervention. The primary objective of this pilot trial is to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger trial to evaluate the effects of a novel KT intervention using exercise and self-management versus usual care among BC survivors. The secondary objective is to determine preliminary estimates of effects of the KT intervention of exercise plus self-management (SM) program versus usual care on (a) levels of exercise knowledge and behaviour (b) health related quality of life and (c) resource utilization among BC survivors over a four month period.    ,NCT03087461
Breast Cancer,Efficacy of Cardio-Oncology Rehabilitation Exercise for Women With Breast Cancer and Treatment Related Cardiotoxicity, Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer among Canadian women with nearly 26000 new cases diagnosed each year. Fortunately advancements in diagnostic tools and curative treatments have significantly improved overall survival. However the development of cardiac toxicity (including asymptomatic and symptomatic heart failure) associated with use of anthracycline containing chemotherapy and targeted therapies including trastuzumab limits improvements in survival for women with breast cancer. Cardiac toxicity is a life threatening complication that leads to reduced physical functioning and quality of life. The increased risk is associated with shared risk factors among cancer and heart failure and the direct influence of cancer therapy on the cardiovascular system. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) (including exercise training and education/counselling) has been shown to improve health outcomes reduce heart failure related hospitalizations and modestly improve mortality among individuals with non-treatment related heart failure and may benefit women with breast cancer and treatment related cardiac toxicity (BC-CT). Therefore this single centre randomized control trial aims to determine if participation in an exercise based CR program can improve cardiorespiratory fitness cardiovascular function/structure and health and quality of life among women with BC-CT.    ,NCT03089502

Breast Cancer,Two Regimens of SAR240550/Weekly Paclitaxel and Paclitaxel Alone as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients, Primary Objective: - to assess the pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate in the breast of patients treated in following combinations: SAR240550 twice-weekly + weekly paclitaxel SAR240550 weekly+ weekly paclitaxel and weekly paclitaxel single agent as calibrator. Secondary objectives are:   -  pCR rate in the breast and axilla   -  Radiological/clinical objective response rate (ORR) breast conservation rate disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in each treatment arm   -  Safety profiles of study combinations and of the single agent reference treatment   -  Molecular characteristics of the tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and any correlation between the biological activity of the study treatment and the disease outcome. Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.    ,NCT01204125
Breast Cancer,Oral Microencapsulated Diindolylmethane in Treating Patients With Stage II-III Triple Negative Androgen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer Who Have Undergone Chemotherapy and Surgery," This study is being done to find out whether a nutritional supplement called BioResponse-DIM (BR-DIM [oral microencapsulated diindolylmethane]) improves the survival for women who have residual cancer cells following surgery after chemotherapy for breast cancer. BR-DIM is an active ingredient in cruciferous vegetables (broccoli brussels sprouts and cauliflower). Consumption of these vegetables has been associated with a decreased risk in several cancers. Researchers also hope to find out whether different biomarkers (also called ""markers"") in the blood predict the chance of breast cancer returning. BR-DIM is thought to be effective in treating stage II-III breast cancer that is triple negative AR positive (+) and where there is residual cancer cells in the breast after chemotherapy.

Breast Cancer,The Role of Myocardial SPECT in Evaluation of Irradiation-induced Changes., Helical tomotherapy nowadays provides the most precise data on radiotherapy (RT) dose delivered to each region of the heart in left-sided breast cancer therapy which allows greater sparing of the heart from doses associated with increased complications. However heart disease shows a wide spectrum of pathologies and multiple risk factors related. The damage of the myocytes may lead to not only myocardial perfusion defects but also in functional deterioration or even in biomarkers. In this study we will monitor cardiovascular (CV) risk factors metabolism biomarkers myocardial perfusion defect patterns and cardiac functional parameters in order to delineate of RT-related effects and clinical impacts. Objective: The pilot study aims to investigate the correlation of post-tomotherapy cardiovascular effects with myocardial perfusion and cardiac functional studies. Methods: The study plans to enroll female breast cancer patients who will undergo local RT after their surgery. Patients will receive global risk scoring assessment (Framingham Risk Score FRS) blood sampling for basic biochemistry inflammatory biomarker and myocardial perfusion image (MPI) at the time points of before and after RT. The results of MPI will be analyzed in qualitative visual interpretation of perfusion patterns and functional quantitative data for cardiac functional parameters as well.

Breast Cancer,Predictors of Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy in Women With Breast Cancer, Breast cancer is the leading cancer diagnosed in women and the second cause of cancer death. Of all racial/ethnic groups in the US Black women have the highest rate of breast cancer deaths. Two-thirds of Black breast cancer patients have estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors that can be treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy. If taken for the full five years this therapy has been shown to reduce mortality by 50%. However ER positive Black women are more likely to die from their breast cancer as ER positive White women. Preliminary data suggest that non-adherence to adjuvant hormonal therapy could explain some of this disparity. To date no study has systematically examined psychosocial healthcare and biological factors that predict adherence to hormonal therapy in Black women with breast cancer. To begin to fill this knowledge gap Investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study of 422 ER positive Black breast cancer patients recruited from health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Our primary outcome is adherence to therapy at 36 months post initiation. Specific aims are to: 1) Examine psychosocial factors (e.g. health beliefs socio-cultural values etc.) that predict adherence to hormonal therapy; 2) Identify clinical (e.g. side effects) and biological (e.g. stage etc.) factors that predict adherence to hormonal therapy; and 3) Evaluate healthcare variables (e.g. communication management of side effects etc.) that predict adherence. Investigators will also explore the role of CYP2D6 genetic variations in adherence to hormonal therapy which is novel and will increase knowledge about this genetic factor in Blacks. The study is focused on the time-period (first 3 years) when women appear to be the most vulnerable to terminating treatment prematurely. A better understanding of predictors of adherence in Black women may help target interventions and ultimately improve potentially avoidable adverse breast cancer outcomes in this underserved group.    ,NCT02992730

Breast Cancer,HORIZONS: Understanding the Impact of Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment on Everyday Life, The purpose of this study is to invite all people diagnosed with cancer who meet the eligibility criteria to complete questionnaires before their treatment begins and at regular intervals over time to assess the impact of cancer and its treatment on people's lives in the short medium and long term. We will explore a range of factors to determine their role in both recovery of health and well-being and self-management. Although it is known that people who have had cancer are likely to experience a number of physical and psychological problems as a result of the disease and treatment it is not known what the 'typical' course of recovery of health and well-being looks like how long it takes and how this can be influenced. We will determine pathways to recovery of health and well-being following cancer diagnosis (initially breast cancer diagnosed <50 years Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and gynaecological cancers) and identify what factors influence this. This includes assessing the relative importance of the person's illness personal attributes perceived burden of treatment role of the environment they live in including health / social care and personal networks of support and their ability and capacity to self-manage. We will identify who is most at risk of problems and what environmental supports and resources people are able to mobilise to support their self-management. We will also explore who has the confidence and ability to manage during and beyond treatment and what factors influence this and whether this leads to earlier problem resolution and restoration of health and well-being. This knowledge will be used to develop and test future supportive interventions to enhance the rapid recovery of health and well-being - our long term aim being to design ways of helping people with cancer in areas we identify as problematic for them.    ,NCT03000192

Breast Cancer,Ketorolac for Analgesia followiNG Autologous Breast RecOnstructiOn, Background: Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has been shown to reduce breakthrough narcotic consumption following orthopaedic neurosurgical and obstetrical procedures. The morphine-sparing effect of ketorolac may reduce respiratory and central nervous system depression post operatively while still providing adequate pain control for patients. Patients undergoing abdominally based microsurgical breast reconstruction may particularly benefit from ketorolac postoperatively and ultimately be safely discharged from hospital sooner than their counterparts receiving standard of care. Research Question: In adult women post-mastectomy undergoing abdominally based microsurgical breast reconstruction does a postoperative regimen of intravenous ketorolac tromethamine in addition to standard of care reduce the length of postoperative hospital stay compared with an intravenous sham saline regimen? Study Design: A single center explanatory placebo-controlled 1:1 allocation 2-arm parallel group superiority randomized and double blinded controlled trial. Population: The study population includes all females >18 years old post mastectomy consenting to abdominally based microsurgical breast reconstruction. Intervention and Comparator: The intervention will be ketorolac 30 mg IV every 6 hours postoperatively for 72 hours. The comparator will be a sham intravenous administration of normal saline. Outcomes: The primary outcome is hospital length of stay postoperatively. Secondary outcomes include visual analog scale for pain breakthrough narcotic consumption surgical drain outputs hematoma and other complications. Sample Size: Available data provided estimates for average length of hospital stay and standard deviation. A minimally clinically significant difference of 1 day was decided on due to expert opinion.

Breast Cancer,Denosumab as an add-on Neoadjuvant Treatment (GeparX), Pharmacologic inhibition of RANKL attenuates the development of mammary carcinoma and inhibits metastatic progression in multiple mouse models. In a retrospective analysis it could be demonstrated that elevated expression of RANK was found in 14.5% of patients overall with a significant predominance in patients with hormone-receptor-negative disease. Expression of RANK was associated with a higher pathological complete response rate but with a shorter disease-free and overall survival. The ABCSG-18 study showed that adjuvant denosumab reduces clinical fractures improves bone health and can be administered without added toxicity. It appears therefore reasonable to test denosumab a clinically available antibody against RANKL in patients with hormone-receptor-negative primary breast cancer as an adjunct to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for its ability to increase pCR rate and improve outcome in relation to the expression of RANK.    ,NCT02682693

Breast Cancer,Breast Screening & Patient Navigation (BSPAN2): Evaluating a De-Centralized Regional Delivery System for Rural Underserved, The investigators will expand BSPan's reach and sustainability by systematizing how to enable counties to assume responsibility for one or two of the components while Moncrief/uTSW continues to provide centralized financial review and reimbursement as the Texas BCCS contractor. The investigators will prospectively identify which counties have the necessary program capacity then test whether implementation of BSPan tailored to a county's capacity and local needs can lead to equivalent program success in an additional 12 rural counties. Findings will be used to develop a model by which BSPan benefits can be brought to rural communities across the country. The investigators will use a readiness assessment criteria (RaC) to gauge county capacity and readiness for BSPan program implementation. The goal of our evaluation is to demonstrate whether a regional decentralized delivery (hub-and-spoke) model can be sustained and increase program reach to underserved rural women. The RaC tool serves two purposes: 1) to determine county capacity and 2) harness program data to facilitate communication during operations between a central BSPan hub and each county partner (spokes). Our evaluation will analyze county training and implementation of BSPan program components and comprehensive screening processes of the hub and spoke model. The investigators will use county site visits and selected interviews of participants and staff to gain insight into factors at the participant and county levels that facilitate adoption and implementation of comprehensive screening processes in conjunction with key quantitative metrics and process outcomes. The investigators will apply the Glasgow Re-aiM model to guide our evaluation of BSPan program component implementation in each county. Re-aiM specifies dimensions at the participant and organizational levels. Dimensions are defined as the intervention's: 1) Reach into the target population 2) effectiveness in modifying risk 3) adoption by target settings 4) consistent implementation and 5) Maintenance of its effects among participants and target settings. our mixed-methods approach will enable focus at both the individual and organizational levels and has been successfully used to assess other similar screening and health promotion programs.    ,NCT03052907

Breast Cancer,A Prototype Tri-modal Imaging Device for Breast Cancer, Breast conservation surgery (BCS) is performed on patients with breast cancer with the intent to resect and completely remove the tumour while conserving as much of the surrounding normal tissue as possible. Currently there is no way for surgeons to determine the adequacy of surgical resection in real-time during surgery; the assessment of surgical margins requires histological examination that is not available in real-time and is impractical in most clinical cases. This results in a re-excision rate of 23% among Canadian women in order to achieve optimal surgical margins. In addition the presence or absence of cancer in tumor draining lymph nodes is recognized as a key element for breast cancer staging; however lymph node dissection can be associated with overtreatment and morbidity (nerve damage and post surgical lymphedema) and histological analysis of nodes can be time consuming and thus delay subsequent procedures. In an effort to address these issues we have designed and constructed in collaboration with Sogang University Seoul S. Korea a novel imaging system that performs three complementary imaging modalities (tri-modal): ultrasound (US) photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL). This first-in-human pilot study will recruit 10 breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving surgery at Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto Canada). The study is designed to test our tri-modal (US PA FL) imaging technology in breast cancer patients. The overall goal is to obtain initial information on the technical feasibility of the tri-modal system in a peri-operative setting and to confirm the anticipated safety of the procedures. Additionally it will provide initial data on the ability of this system to detect/localize primary breast cancer lesions and cancer-involved lymph nodes prior to surgery.    ,NCT02794064

Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer Toxicity, The aims of the cohort will be to quantify impact of cancer treatments toxicities  and to generate predictors of chronic toxicity in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer. The project will include four specific aims :   1. To develop a database of chronic treatment related toxicity in a cohort of 20 000 women with stage I-III breast cancer (= non metastatic) whatever these treatments are (surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy ??   2. To describe incidence clinical presentation and outcome of chronic toxicities over a maximum of 8 years.   3. To describe the psychological the social and the economic impacts of chronic toxicities.   4. To generate predictors for chronic toxicities in order to prevent them based upon biological criteria. The expected impact of these toxicities when identified will be to improve quality of life and to decrease health cost by the early identification of patients at high risk of toxicity. Such early identification could lead to prevent toxic effect by: a. developing prevention strategies b. substituting toxic treatment by a non (less) toxic one. Also such cohort will offer a quantification of the impact of treatment toxicity that could be further used to quantify medical usefulness of strategies that aim at decreasing treatment toxicities (implementation of predictive biomarker for resistance cytotoxic-free regimen etc??    ,NCT01993498
Breast Cancer,Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Operable Premenopausal Breast Cancer Patients, The current study is a multicentre randomized open (unblended) prospective clinical trial which is sponsored by the researchers. The trial is designed to compare the effectiveness between docetaxel plus epirubicin and docetaxel plus epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable premenopausal breast cancer patients and also to compare the outcomes associated with chemo-induced amenorrhea between the two neoadjuvant chemotherapies. The investigators will randomly assign 600 premenopausal female patients with operable breast cancer to receive four cycles of docetaxel and epirubicin (TE); or four cycles of docetaxel epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (TEC). After every two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy the investigators will estimate the effectiveness of therapy. Patients will undergo modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery after four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then receive postoperative chemotherapy (two cycles) radiation therapy herceptin targeted therapy or hormone therapy according to the NCCN (2011) guideline. The follow-up will be ten years after surgeries. The primary aim is to examine whether the docetaxel and epirubicin (TE) will be as effective as the docetaxel epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (TEC) (pCR rate cCR rate PR rate SD rate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)). The secondary aim is to correlate chemo (TE/TEC)-induced amenorrhea with outcomes in premenopausal women.    ,NCT01503905
Breast Cancer,Nurse Intervention Project," The use of interventions for cancer-related distress is important to reduce this distress. Distress has a negative impact on quality of life the recovery during and after treatment and may even adversely affect survival. There is insufficient attention to the systematic approach to psychosocial problems in cancer patients in the Netherlands. A task force discussed and studied which instrument measures psychosocial problems best. The distress thermometer (""lastmeter"") had the best results. A guideline is written to use the distress thermometer for patients with cancer and will be used in hospitals in the Netherlands. However it is not clear what the effects are of the use of the distress thermometer on the psychosocial wellbeing of the patient. Furthermore it is also unknown whether the use of the distress thermometer leads to cost-effective care. The study focuses on the use of the distress thermometer in breast cancer patients. An efficiency study (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the systematic use of the distress thermometer and its discussion by a nurse as compared to the usual care provided to outpatients who are treated with curative intent for breast cancer by their treating physicians. The clinical and economic impact of the use of the Distress thermometer will be assessed in comparison with usual care.The recruitment of patients will take place in the out-patient clinic of a university hospital. Patients will be followed from diagnose until two years after finishing their treatment.    ",NCT01091584

Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer Prevention Education, We will develop and evaluate a community-based approach for disseminating comparative effective reviews (CERs) about breast cancer prevention to African American women. The specific aims of our research as shown below will target this population because of persistent disparities in breast cancer morbidity and mortality among this population. Our primary aims are:   1. To evaluate uptake of a community-based strategy for disseminating CERs about breast cancer prevention to African American women based on sociodemographic characteristics beliefs about medical research and medical history. We predict that participation in a community forum will be higher among women with greater socioeconomic resources those who have a family history of breast cancer and women who have more positive beliefs about research.   2. To evaluate the impact of evidential versus non-evidential content about breast cancer prevention on psychological and behavioral outcomes that include: knowledge of breast cancer risk factors and prevention strategies communication with individuals in their social and medical network and distrust of medical research. We predict that women who receive evidential content that is specific for African American women will report greater knowledge about breast cancer risk factors and prevention strategies will be more likely to discuss breast cancer prevention strategies with individuals in their social and medical network and will report greater reductions in distrust of medical research compared to those who receive non-evidential content.    ,NCT01299623
Breast Cancer,Phase II Study of Metformin for Reduction of Obesity-Associated Breast Cancer Risk, Overweight and obesity are well established risk factors for breast cancer that develop after menopause. The increased postmenopausal breast cancer risk in women who are overweight or obese is likely to be attributed to multiple metabolic disturbances. Metformin is a commonly used medication in diabetics to stabilize blood sugar. Association studies and laboratory studies have shown its potential to reduce the risk for development of cancer including breast cancer. Recent pilot clinical studies in breast cancer patients suggest that metformin may only be effective in overweight or obese women with metabolic disturbances. We propose to conduct a clinical study of metformin in overweight or obese premenopausal women with metabolic disturbances. Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive metformin or placebo for 12 months. The study will evaluate whether metformin can result in favorable changes in risk features that have been associated with increased breast cancer risk. The risk features that will be examined in our study include breast density certain proteins and hormones products of body metabolism and body weight and composition. The study should help determine the potential breast cancer preventive activity of metformin in a growing population at risk for multiple diseases.    ,NCT02028221

Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer Recurrence - the Accuracy of Dual-time PET/CT, The purpose of this study is to elucidate the value of dual-time-point PET/CT in the recurrence of breast cancer and to determine whether the method is better than the modalities used in the standard work up. 150 patients with suspected breast cancer recurrence will be included. All patients will undergo dual-time-point PET/CT CT of thorax and upper abdomen and bone scintigraphy. After completion of the examinations the early and the late PET/CT scan will be compared with each other the diagnostic CT-scan and the bone scintigraphy. A verification of suspicious findings will be done by biopsy if the area is accessible. If a biopsy cannot be obtained the presence of recurrence will be verified with additional imaging follow-up to ensure the highest possible confidence. Sensitivity specificity accuracy negative and positive predictive value (NPV/PPV) will be calculated for each modality (incl. early and late PET/CT).    ,NCT01552655
Breast Cancer,Patient Preference for Everolimus in Combination With Exemestane or Capecitabine in Combination With Bevacizumab, This is a clinical trial with a crossover design to determine patients' preference for capecitabine in combination with bevacizumab or everolimus in combination with exemestane for advanced breast cancer patients and to evaluate if any combination is associated with a better quality of life. To identify patients' preference for either therapy in this trial patients without disease progression or other reasons for early discontinuation will be asked for their treatment preference and their treatment satisfaction. To correlate patients' preference with other patient reported outcomes (PROs) quality of life (QoL) will be assessed at baseline and throughout the study using dedicated questionnaires. With similarly active treatment options it is of utmost importance to identify the treatment that has the least negative impact on the patients' quality of life.    ,NCT02248571

Breast Cancer,Prone Whole-Breast RadiationTherapy Versus Supine Whole-Breast Radiation Therapy Imaging, Radiation therapy to the breast has remained a standard practice for breast conserving therapy. Because of the location of the heart and lungs when patients are positioned face-up whole breast radiation therapy has been reported to increase the risk of damage to the heart a few years after treatment until at least 20 years after exposure and may affect cardiovascular mortality. Also patients receiving whole breast radiation therapy are at an increased risk for development of secondary lung malignancies. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in dose to the heart and lungs when treated in the face-down position. Similarly correcting for the movement of breathing (respiratory gating) in the face-up position has also become an available option for reducing unwanted dose to the heart and lungs particularly in left sided breast cancers. No study to date has compared these newer organ-sparing techniques head-to-head for early stage breast cancer. It is institutional policy to perform CT simulation in left-sided breast cancer patients with and without the respiratory gating (this is one CT scan) in the face-up position. It is also standard of care to perform the face-down CT simulation in large breasted women. Both of these simulations are meant to reduce the exposure of the heart and lungs to radiation. In this study all left-sided breast cancer patients that consent will receive face-up CT simulation with and without gating AND face-down CT simulation regardless of breast size; thus each patient is their own control. The treating physician will determine which of the two simulations if any offers better protection to each patients' heart and lungs. Two dosimetrists will be required to independently verify planned dosimetry with all treatment setups. Treatment will be planned in standard fashion using the best of the two plans.    ,NCT03037723
Breast Cancer,Soy Selenium and Breast Cancer Risk, There is evidence to suggest that some dietary components can reduce the risk of breast cancer. In this pilot study two such components isoflavones (compounds found in soy products) and selenium will be given to women classed as at moderate to high risk of the disease. The aim is to determine some novel biomarkers of risk and to see the effect of supplementation on them.    ,NCT00555386
Breast Cancer,Total Xenoestrogen Body Burden in Relation to Mammographic Density a Marker of Breast Cancer Rlisk, Mammographic density is sensitive to estorgen exposure and constitutes a strong intermediate maker of breast cancer risk.

Breast Cancer,The Effects of Equivalent Weight Loss With or Without Exercise Training on Breast Cancer Risk (SHAPE-2), Physical inactivity and overweight are two accepted risk factors for breast cancer. However because of their correlation it is not clear which is most relevant to risk. The investigators now set out to study whether physical activity in addition to weight loss by diet only affects sex hormone levels known to be related to breast cancer risk. In the SHAPE-2 study 250 healthy overweight/obese and physically inactive women are randomly allocated to a diet-induced weight loss group a combined exercise- and diet-induced weight loss group or a control group. The aim of the first two intervention groups is to loose 5-6 kg of bodyweight either by dieting or mainly by increased physical activity. Measurements are performed at baseline and after 21 weeks the end of the study period. The aim of this study is to provide insight into the effect of weight loss mainly driven by exercise compared to equivalent weight loss due to nutritional calorie restriction on breast cancer biomarkers.    ,NCT01511276

Breast Cancer,Trial of a Mammography Decision Aid for Women Aged 75 and Older, The aim of this study is to test whether an educational pamphlet on mammography designed for women aged 75 and older improves older women's decision-making around mammography screening. The investigators aim to show that the educational pamphlet improves older women's knowledge of the pros and cons or screening and leads to fewer women in poor health with short life expectancy being screened.    ,NCT02198690
Breast Cancer,Comparison of Whole Breast Screening Ultrasound and Contrast Enhanced Mammography for Supplemental Breast Cancer Screening, Breast tumors are often detected on mammography but may be harder to see in women with dense breasts. This is why screening breast ultrasound is sometimes used as another test in women with dense breasts. Ultrasound has been shown to detect additional cancers that are not seen on regular mammography. Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammography (CEDM) is a FDA approved form of mammography. It is essentially a routine digital mammogram performed after iodine dye (the same that is used with CT scans) is injected into a vein in the arm. Like screening ultrasound CEDM has been shown to detect breast cancers that are not seen on a regular mammogram. The purpose of this study is to compare whether CEDM or screening breast ultrasound is better at detecting cancer. Both will be done in this study and compared to one another.    ,NCT02310698

Breast Cancer,Novel Social Media Intervention For Older Br CA Patients, The number of patients 60 and older with breast cancer is increasing as our population ages. Despite the fact that the majority of breast cancers occur in patients 60 and over these patients are consistently under-represented in clinical trials. Because patients 60 and older are an under-studied group investigators do not have detailed information on the side effects and experiences for these patients receiving chemotherapy. Understanding the side effects patients receiving chemotherapy experience is an important part of this study. In addition past research has shown that having poor social support can affect quality of life mood and outcomes for people with cancer. However few studies in the past have focused on improving the quality of life and support systems that patients have while they receive treatment. This research study is evaluating how engaging in an online support community may improve the experience of older patients receiving chemotherapy.    ,NCT02639208

Breast Cancer,The Effects of Peri-Operative Pregabalin on Post-Operative Pain Following Breast Cancer Surgery With Axillary Node Dissection: A Pilot Study, Breast cancer is a devastating disease. Some women with breast cancer undergo surgery to remove the breast and lymph nodes in the axilla (armpit). Unfortunately surgery of this type is associated with pain both in the days immediately following the operation and in the long term. Pain that continues for more than three months after surgery is known as chronic pain and affects as many as 1/5 to more than ½ of patients having this surgery. Often this pain is of a particular type known as neuropathic pain. There have been studies demonstrating that the intensity of pain after surgery may be related to the likelihood of developing chronic pain. It is important to develop methods to reduce acute pain after breast cancer surgery and to reduce chronic pain for breast cancer survivors. Pregabalin is a medication used in the treatment of chronic pain. It has been shown to be effective for neuropathic pain. There has also been one study demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing pain after dental extraction. We are interested in determining whether pregabalin taken for 14 days starting the day of surgery will reduce acute (short term) pain and chronic pain from this type of breast cancer surgery. In order to test ability of pregabalin for the reduction of chronic pain it may be necessary to follow a large number of patients for up to one year after surgery. This may require studying patients in more than one institution. Prior to starting such a large study we are proposing a pilot or preliminary study. This study will follow a smaller group of participants (68) for 6 months. From the pilot study we will determine the effect of pregabalin on acute pain and logistic and statistical information required for the full study. We will randomly assign participants to receive pregabalin or placebo (sugar pills) for twice daily for 14 days starting one hour before surgery. We will monitor the participants' pain at one hour after surgery 24 hours after surgery one week two weeks three months and six months after surgery. We will also monitor for a number of other parameters such as medication side effects and the need for other pain medications. Recruitment of study participants is expected to take 6-7 months.    ,NCT00852683

This study is evaluating whether participating in a 12-week Qigong program (pronounced chee kung) an exercise program that involves gentle movements combined with breathing/relaxation techniques also known as mind-body exercise leads to improvement of pain physical function and quality of life among breast cancer survivors that have significant pain following surgery.    ,NCT02848989
Breast Cancer,Assessment of Ovarian Reserve in Female Cancer Survivors, Chemotherapy can damage the ovaries and cause premature menopause. In women treated before the age of 40 years menopause does not usually occur. We have very little information about the impact of chemotherapy on ovarian function in this particular group of women. In this study we will check hormone blood tests and ultrasound tests of the ovaries to measure the reserve of eggs left in the ovaries after treatment in young survivors of breast cancer and childhood cancer. We will do the same tests in our comparison group. We can use these results to estimate the reduction in fertility in young cancer survivors.    ,NCT01062542
Breast Cancer,Group Interventions for Breast Cancer Survivors," The purpose of this study is to compare two types of groups for breast cancer survivors: a Meaning-Centered Group and a Discussion Group. Many breast cancer survivors seek help to deal with the emotional burden of having gone through the cancer experience. Participation in groups offering support often helps cancer survivors cope with stressors of life after having had cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings. The ""Meaning-Centered Group"" is intended to teach breast cancer survivors how to maintain or even increase a sense of meaning and purpose in their lives after treatment for cancer. The ""Discussion Group"" is intended to help breast cancer survivors cope by giving them a place to get support from other breast cancer survivors. The goal of this study is to compare the benefits of these two types of group approaches for breast cancer survivors. The study is also testing the benefits and feasibility of conducting the groups virtually using a telephone and computer.    ",NCT01775085

Breast Cancer,Effects of an e-Home Based Symptom Management and Mindfulness Training Programme on QoL in Breast Cancer Survivors, Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in Singapore. Breast cancer survivors usually experience side effects/symptoms after surgery and/or adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy such as fatigue lymphedema problems with sleeping peripheral neuropathy and anxiety/depression. Currently there is no study to include both symptom management and mindfulness training components for breast cancer survivors. And given breast cancer survivors have infrequent clinical follow-up we aim to develop an e-Home based symptom management and mindfulness training programme for breast cancer survivors and to determine its effects on quality of life symptom distress psychosocial adjustment psychological morbidity and unplanned outpatient attendance or hospitalisation in breast cancer survivors. We employ a randomised clinical trial with four study arms (with 47 subjects in each arm) together with a process evaluation; group 1 (usual care) group 2 (experimental group: five weekly sessions of online symptom management + mindfulness training programme and usual care) group 3 (comparison group 1: five weekly sessions of online symptom management programme and usual care) and group 4 (comparison group 2: five weekly sessions of online mindfulness training programme and usual care). Subjects will complete questionnaires measures of 6-item Social Support Questionnaire Breast Cancer Survivor Self-Efficacy Scale the Quality of Life-Cancer Survivor Scale Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale short version of the Fear of Recurrence Scale Hospital and anxiety Depression Scale and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire at baseline (printed questionnaires) at 8 weeks from baseline at 12 weeks from baseline and at 24 weeks from baseline by an online system or printed questionnaires. Individualised semi-structured interview (15-25 mins) for experimental and comparison groups will be conducted at 24 weeks from baseline to understand the subjects' experiences of the study programme. Data will be analysed using SPSS version 24. Baseline demographic and clinical information of subjects in the experimental comparison and control groups will be summarised using descriptive statistics and will be compared using chi square tests and ANOVA/ANCOVA tests. Intention-to-treat approach will be used. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to examine the differences on outcome measures among the experimental comparison and control groups across study time points. In addition differences in changes in outcome measures among experimental comparison groups and usual care groups will be tested using multilevel modelling techniques. A p-value smaller than 5% will be considered as statistically significant. Content analysis will be conducted to analyse the interviews data.    ,NCT02931864

Breast Cancer,Acupuncture for Chronic Lymphedema, This study is being done because women have arm swelling for more than 6 months despite wrapping and other treatments. This swelling is called lymphedema. It is the back up of lymph system fluid that causes swelling in the arm. The swelling can just happen but more commonly it is caused when lymph nodes are removed during cancer surgery. It can develop right after breast cancer treatment or weeks months or even years later. In our preliminary research the investigators found that more than 1/3 of the 33 patients showed at least a 30% reduction in lymphedema following acupuncture treatment and there were no serious adverse events during the treatment or 6 month followup. This study will include a larger group of patients. Patients will be assigned to one of two groups and results of the groups will be compared to see if acupuncture can reduce lymphedema and whether the effect lasts after acupuncture treatment is completed.    ,NCT01706081

Breast Cancer,DMSO for Prevention of Capsular Contraction in Alloplastic Breast Reconstruction, Capsular contraction is the one of the most common complications of both esthetic and reconstructive breast surgery with high incidence after radiotherapy. The mechanism of the contraction is unclear but is believed to be similar to the formation of hypertrophic scarring. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has demonstrated its use as an anti-inflammatory anti-proliferative and antibacterial agent. The aim of this study is to test the effect of DMSO on the incidence and severity if capsular contracture after breast alloplastic reconstruction in irradiated patients. We conduct a prospective randomized-control single-surgeon study in the tertiary academic Rabin Medical Center. 110 female candidates for mastectomy radiotherapy and immediate two-stage reconstruction will be included. They will be divided into two groups: the DMSO treatment group which will be treated according to our protocol and the control group that will be treated with the same protocol but with 0.9% saline instead. Several measures will be taken including: capsular contracture grading by two plastic surgeons a VAS-score of breast pain maximal capsular thickness (MCT) in sonography evaluation and pathology examination of the capsule (biopsy will be taken during the second stage operation). Rates and grades of capsular contracture evident clinically radiologically and pathologically will be evaluated and compared.    ,NCT02206477

Breast Cancer,A Pilot Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Biological Activity of Fulvestrant in Breast Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), The subjects in this trial have been diagnosed as having a pre-cancerous disease of the breast called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This condition is associated with the development of breast cancer in up to 50% of cases. The subjects are being asked to participate in this research study. They are being offered voluntary admission to this study to test the effects of a new investigational drug called Fulvestrant (Faslodex). This drug is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced breast cancer but has not been approved for the treatment of DCIS. However the FDA has given permission for the drug to be tested in this study. The purpose of this study is to find out if Fulvestrant has any effect on the subject's precancerous changes by comparing samples taken before and after receiving Fulvestrant.    ,NCT00183963
Breast Cancer,Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Overexpresses HER-2/NEU, This randomized phase III trial studies first-line chemotherapy and trastuzumab to compare how well they work when given with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with breast cancer that overexpresses human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/NEU) and has spread to other areas of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel and carboplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab and bevacizumab may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of breast cancer by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. It is not yet known whether giving first-line chemotherapy together with trastuzumab is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER-2/NEU.    ,NCT00520975

Breast Cancer,Collection of Tissue Samples for Study of Multidrug Resistance," Background: Resistance to cancer chemotherapy develops in patients rendering certain treatments ineffective. Despite much research the prevailing cause of drug resistance is not known. One mechanism for drug resistance involves a protein called P-glycoprotein or Pgp which reduces the effectiveness of cancer treatments by ""pumping"" anti-cancer drugs out of tumor cells where they are supposed to work against the disease. Objectives: To identify and evaluate more thoroughly the roles of Pgp and other substances in mediating drug resistance. Eligibility: Patients enrolled in clinical trials of cancer therapies at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh; Cancer Centers of Carolinas; Arizona Clinical Research Center; University of Copenhagen; and Herlev Hospital Copenhagen who have consented to the use of blood tissue or tumor samples for laboratory studies. Design: Blood tumor and tissue samples are collected from participants and sent to the NCI for various laboratory analyses.    ",NCT00880503

Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel and carboplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Giving veliparib together with paclitaxel and carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.    ,NCT01366144
Breast Cancer,Cosmetic Evaluation of Lumpectomy Versus Oncolytic Mammoplasty With Bilateral Breast Reduction for Early Stage Breast Cancer, This study will evaluate the cosmetic outcome and examine factors contributing to cosmetic outcome in women treated with lumpectomy or bilateral breast reduction mammoplasty/mastopexy (BRM) followed by hypofractionated whole breast irradiation. Breast conservation is now an established method of treatment for early breast cancer. Because breast conservation is essentially a cosmetic alternative to mastectomy quality of life cosmetic outcome and tumor control are all important considerations during comprehensive treatment planning. Irradiation schemes have been demonstrated to be efficacious and with excellent short term cosmetic outcomes. However their interaction with currently evolving surgical techniques needs to be examined in order to maintain optimal local control while preserving cosmetic outcome.    ,NCT01400399

Breast Cancer,Diagosis of Breast Carcinoma: Characterization of Breast Lesions With CLEARPEMSONIC : Feasibility Study, Breast cancer is the first cancer in women the second etiology of death by cancer and the first cause for women between 35 and 55 years. Diagnostic tools and large screening have been realized with positive impact in a recent review with 31% less likely to die of breast cancer over nearly 30 years compared to women who didn't get regular screening mammograms. Diagnostic tools and treatment also are improving continuously. However for some women breast cancer diagnosis is difficult in case of high density breast breast modifications after surgery??In these cases breast MRI is currently the best imaging tool with high sensitivity about 90% but with a lower specificity about 60% that lead to futile biopsies. Recently molecular imaging with PET-CT scan with 18FDG has permitted to widely modify cancer treatment. However PET-CT scan is not a good imaging tool for initial diagnostic of breast tumor because of a lack in spatial resolution about 8mm. So researchers developed dedicated PET scan for breast called Positron Emission Mammography. Our project is in this field of view and is named CLEARPEMSONIC. First clinical studies with PEM showed very good performance of this imaging modality for initial evaluation of breast tumors. PEM performance is not affected by breast density hormonal status. Spatial resolution is less than 3mm. PEM seems complementary with MRI adding a better specificity value. In the field of CERIMED ClearPemSonic Project aims to evaluate an new imaging tool which combined PEM scan and ultrasonography. Technologic evaluation was made. Now a feasibility study is the first step for clinical applications. The main objective of this project is to confirm the feasibility of PEM scan with the ClearPEmSonic. Secondary objectives are to compare results with other conventional imaging modalities and MRI. The gold standard will be histology of the breast tumor.    ,NCT01569321

Breast Cancer,Prospective Study of UDP-gluconoryltransferase 2B17 Genotype as a Predictive Marker of Exemestane PK and PD, Aromatase inhibitors have led to significant improvements in clinical outcomes for women with postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer. However there is a notable absence of phase III comparisons among the three agents and therefore no clear indication of the superiority of one AI over the others. Furthermore there remains a distinct lack of predictive biomarkers of AI efficacy and toxicity to inform clinical decisions. The metabolic pathways of exemestane have recently been delineated and UGT2B17 is the most active hepatic gluconoryltransferase responsible for the glucuronidation of the crucial active exemestane metabolite 17-dihydroxyexemestane. The UGT2B17*2/*2 deletion genotype is associated with markedly reduced glucuronidation of 17-dihydroxyexemestane in vitro and is found more commonly in Asians than Caucasians (60-70% vs less than 10%). Our research group recently demonstrated significant reduction in glucuronidation of vorinostat a UGT2B17 substrate with a trend towards improved clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in Asian breast cancer patients who were UGT2B17*2 homozygotes treated with this compound. In-vivo studies correlating UGT2B17*2 genotype with exemestane pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are lacking. We hypothesize that individuals with UGT2B17*2/*2 genotype have reduced glucuronidation of 17-dihydroxyexemestane and therefore have increased exposure to the active drug resulting in improved treatment efficacy. We propose a study of exemestane in hormone receptor positive post-menopausal advanced breast cancer patients with prospective correlation of treatment outcome by UGT2B17 genotype. The primary endpoint is the correlation of genotype (UGT2B17*2/*2 vs those with at least one wild-type variant) with clinical benefit rate and secondary endpoints include its association with exemestane pharmacokinetics progression-free survival overall survival and musculoskeletal toxicities.    ,NCT01655004

In addition Ki-67 a marker of cellular proliferation could be used to select those patients who benefit from treatment with a PI3K-pathway inhibitor.    ,NCT01430585
Breast Cancer,Comparison of Acute Toxicity and Cost Between Whole Breast Irradiation With Sequential Boost and Simultaneous Integrated Boost After Breast Conserving Surgery., Whole breast irradiation (WBI) after breast conserving surgery for early-stage breast cancer halves the recurrence risk and reduces the breast cancer death by about one sixth. A sequential boost (SeqB) dose to the tumour bed further improves local control but also increases the risk of late skin toxicity and cosmetic changes. At Ghent University Hospital WBI is prescribed in 15 fractions of 2.67 Gy according to the START-B hypofractionation scheme. A sequential boost is typically given in 4 to 8 extra fractions which prolongs the overall treatment time. The boost dose can also be delivered within the 15 fractions of WBI the so-called simultaneous integrated boost (SIB). SIB shortens the overall treatment time which is convenient for the patient and the radiotherapy department. In this study we wish to test the hypothesis of acceptable skin toxicity and reduced cost with SIB using hypofractionated prone intensity modulation radiotherapy IMRT with topographical dose painting a technique recently developed in our group. Patients are randomized between SeqB and SIB.    ,NCT01973634

The objectives are to:   -  Review early stage breast cancer patient cases treated at Summa Akron City Hospital between 2006 and 2009 to evaluate clinical and pathological staging   -  Determine the results of preoperative breast MRI and the impact on type of surgery performed   -  Evaluate the decision to have mastectomy rather than lumpectomy i.e. physician or patient decision and if this decision was based on breast MRI findings    ,NCT01166581
Breast Cancer,Pilot Study to Evaluate the Impact of Denosumab on Disseminated Tumor Cells (DTC) in Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to see whether taking denosumab for 12 months in women with a significant number of disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow can reduce the number of these cells below a significant level.    ,NCT01545648
Breast Cancer,POWER-remote Weight Loss Program in Early Stage Breast Cancer, This research is being done to assess the effectiveness of a weight loss program in women with early stage breast cancer whose body mass index (BMI) is in the overweight or obese range (>25). Weight loss is beneficial in improving cardiovascular risk factors and overall health but may also decrease the chance of breast cancer coming back. A weight loss counseling program was studied in a general population and was found to be effective to help reduce weight over a 2 year period. The main goal of this study is to determine if women with a recent diagnosis of early breast cancer will also lose weight with this program. To better understand the effect that weight loss has on women with breast cancer we will compare the patterns in blood and breast tissue samples (tissue biopsies will be optional) and questionnaires evaluating different aspects of one's well-being before and after a dietary intervention or no intervention.    ,NCT01871116
Breast Cancer,Anti-proliferative Effects of Vitamin D and Melatonin in Breast Cancer, Investigators plan to carry out a study to investigate two different pills Vitamin D and melatonin and whether they can reduce the spread of cancer cells in the tumors of women with breast cancer. These pills are inexpensive and have very few side effects. A large number of studies using cell cultures and animals have shown that both vitamin D and melatonin can help destroy breast cancer cells. However thoughtful and well-designed studies are necessary on humans to see if they can decrease the spread of breast cancer and possibly even prevent breast cancer. The proposed study aims to understand the anti-cancer activity of vitamin D and melatonin. This knowledge will assist in creating efficient cancer prevention strategies for Canadians. This study will include women with breast cancer who are being planned for surgery and will assess whether treatment with vitamin D (dose of 2000 IU per day) in a group of 36 women or melatonin (dose of 20mg per day) in another group of 36 women or both pills together in yet another group of 36 women reduces the spread of cancer cells when compared to a fourth group of 36 women who are treated with sugar pills. To do this we will measure a substance in the blood called Ki67 which provides information about the spread of cancer. Investigators will compare the Ki67 levels in the 4 groups and all women will receive identical appearing pills so they will not know which treatment they received.    ,NCT01965522
Breast Cancer,A Randomized Controlled Trial to Determine the Effects of an Exercise Intervention on Physical Activity During Chemotherapy for Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer, This study is designed to randomly assign breast cancer patients requiring and agreeing to chemotherapy into two groups. One group will be receive an exercise prescription aimed at increasing physical activity by a minimum of 10 MET (metabolic equivalent task) hours per week. The other group will not receive a exercise prescription but their activity will be recorded. The hypothesis is that participants that are most active will exhibit improved chemotherapy completion rates improved fitness less fatigue and lower levels of markers for inflammation in their blood.    ,NCT02159157
Breast Cancer,Partial Breast Irradiation Using Interstitial Permanent Palladium-103 Seed Implant, Permanent Breast Seed Implant (PBSI) has been demonstrated to be a well accepted and well tolerated form of partial breast radiotherapy.

Breast Cancer,A Multi Centre Study to Determine the Feasibility of Using an Integrated Consent Model to Compare Standard of Care Administration Schedules of G-CSF (Filgrastim) for Primary Prophylaxis of Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia in Early Stage Breast Cancer (React-G Study)," In patients with early-stage breast cancer chemotherapy has substantially improved survival rates for breast cancer patients. Improvements in outcomes however are compromised by the considerable toxicities associated with chemotherapy most notable being neutropenia. Neutropenia is the presence of abnormally few white blood cells leading to increased susceptibility to infection and can require hospitalization and need for intravenous antibiotics and is sometimes fatal. Febrile neutropenia can also be associated with treatment delays and dose reductions potentially compromising treatment efficacy. Patients can receive medication to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia such as Neupogen (Filgrastim) as a daily injection for 5 7 or 10 days. Since there is genuine uncertainty amongst healthcare professionals as to which administration schedule of Neupogen is better investigators are performing a randomized study in which patients are put into a group by chance to give participants one of three standards of Neupogen daily injection. Neupogen can cost approximately $200 per injection so if a physician prescribes 10 days for 8 cycles of treatment this can cost $16000 compared to a 5 day prescription which would cost half this. In addition to cost savings many patients are not able to give themselves injections on a daily basis and require nursing resources which are utilized at high-cost. This study will use an ""integrated consent model"" that involves an ""oral consent"" rather than a written informed consenting process in order to increase the number of patients who may participate while performing a study at a lower cost. While determining the optimal treatment will improve patient comfort and acceptability using the minimal safe duration of administration may also offer cost savings.    ",NCT02428114

Breast Cancer,Avoiding Growth Factor During Paclitaxel Treatment in Breast Cancer," This research study is testing the safety and feasibility of delivering the 4 cycles of 'dose-dense' paclitaxel without the use of Neulasta (Pegfilgrastim) as a Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor (G-CSF) support. The research study is for participants who have early stage breast cancer and have been recommended to receive a standard chemotherapy regimen doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) plus Paclitaxel (T) in what is called a ""dose-dense"" fashion to prevent recurrences.    ",NCT02698891
Breast Cancer,Granulocyte-colony Stimulating Factors or Antibiotics for Primary Prophylaxis for Febrile Neutropenia," Taxotere-cyclophosphamide (TC) chemotherapy is commonly used as an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in patients with resected early stage breast cancer. TC chemotherapy can cause febrile neutropenia (FN) which can be serious and associated with treatment delays and dose reductions thereby compromising treatment efficacy. To reduce the risk of chemotherapy-induced FNTC is administered with either one of two highly effective standard treatments; namely primary prophylaxis with either ciprofloxacin or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). However there are considerable cost differences between these strategies; subcutaneous daily G-CSF costs at least $12000 over 4 cycles of treatment while oral ciprofloxacin costs about $100. The investigators have therefore been performing a feasibility study to explore whether the ""integrated consent model"" involving oral consent is feasible in practice; and whether it can be used to increase the number of physicians and patients who take part in clinical trials. This feasibility study (REaCT-TC NCT02173262) has been an amazing success and the investigators are therefore now performing a definitive study comparing G-CSF with ciprofloxacin. This study will not be evaluating feasibility endpoints but rather clinically important endpoints of hospitalizations and febrile neutropenia rates.    ",NCT02816112
Breast Cancer,A Study to Compare Administration Schedules of G-CSF (Filgrastim) for Primary Prophylaxis of Febrile Neutropenia, In patients with early-stage breast cancer chemotherapy has substantially improved survival rates. Improvements in outcomes however are compromised by the considerable toxicities associated with chemotherapy the most notable being neutropenia. Neutropenia is the presence of abnormally few white blood cells leading to increase susceptibility to infection and can require hospitalization and need for intravenous antibiotics and is sometimes fatal. Febrile neutropenia (FN) can also be associated with treatment delays and dose reductions potentially compromising treatment efficacy. Patients can receive medication to reduce the risk of FN such as Neupogen (filgrastim) as a daily injection for 5 7 or 10 days. Since there is genuine uncertainty among healthcare professionals as to which administration schedule of Neupogen is the best for patients the investigators are performing a randomized study for which patients will receive either 5 7 or 10 days of Neupogen. Neupogen can cost approximately $200/injection so if a physician prescribes 10 days for 8 cycles of treatment this can cost $16000 compared to a 5 day treatment which would cost half this. In addition to cost savings many patients are not able to give themselves injections on a daily basis and require nursing resources which are utilized at high cost. This study will use an oral consent model to compare 5 7 and 10 days of Neupogen to evaluate rates of febrile neutropenia and hospitalization.    ,NCT02816164
Breast Cancer,Registry Trial to Evaluate the Clinical Utilization of Targeted Axillary Dissection (TAD), A downstaging of axillary tumor-spread can be achieved in about 40% of the patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The impact of NACT on loco-regional tumor control has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Moreover the pathologic nodal status after NACT is a strong prognostic marker. Therefore it is most desirable to identify the approximately 40% of patients with pathologic complete response of the axilla that could be spared from a potentially non beneficial axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Attempts to identify these patients via sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NACT have failed to provide acceptable false negative rates (FNR). The new concept of targeted axillary dissection (TAD) following NACT has shown promising results. Still multiple information about the clinical adoption of this procedure into clinical practice are missing. The SenTa registry trial is designed to assess the clinical implementation of TAD into general practice.    ,NCT03102307

Breast Cancer,Tolerance of PICC Line Versus Implanted Port for Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Early Breast Cancer, Adjuvant chemotherapy is frequently proposed to patients presenting early breast cancer in case of high risk of recurrence (large tumors node involvement high grade??. Due to its toxicity toward veins chemotherapy must be administered through a central venous device. Today one can use either an implanted port or a PICC line (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter). A PICC line is easier to implant and to explant but has to be flushed every week and may impact daily life (no swimming some clothes may not fit). On the other hand a port is subcutaneous and lets patients lead a normal life but its implant and explant require a cutaneous incision with possible complications (bleeding pain infection). For both venous devices complications such as thrombosis or infection may happen. Published data comparing the two devices are heterogeneous and do not often distinguish patients treated for different diseases at various stages. Empirically in daily practice for long term use (>6 months) a port is usually preferred whereas for short-term treatments (<6 weeks) a PICC line is used. In the case of Her2 negative early breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy usually lasts 4 to 5 months. There is no scientific evidence for preferring one device to the other for these patients. The aim of this study is to prospectively compare the patients' satisfaction and tolerance of each of the two devices.    ,NCT02095743
Breast Cancer,Sentinel Node Vs Observation After Axillary Ultra-souND, The hypothesis of this trial are that:   -  avoiding axillary surgery does not worsen the outcome of patients with small breast cancer the absence of the pathological information on the risk of recurrence given by nodal status is not worsening outcome of these patients   -  pre-operative imaging of the axilla can identify patients with clinically relevant nodal burden. The aims of this prospective randomized study are:   -  to verify whether in presence of a negative preoperative axillary assessment SLN can be spared   -  to verify whether in presence of a negative preoperative axillary assessment the decision on adjuvant medical treatment can be taken according only to the biology of the tumour without the prognostic information achieved by SLNB on the nodal status   -  to verify whether in presence of a negative preoperative axillary assessment the patients' quality of life can be improved by a less invasive surgical procedure.    ,NCT02167490
Breast Cancer,Stereotactic Image-Guided Neoadjuvant Ablative Radiation Then Lumpectomy, Radiation therapy after surgery to remove breast cancer improves control of the breast cancer. Standard therapy after breast conservation surgery is five to six weeks of radiation to the entire breast. This clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness of conformal radiation therapy delivered only to the area in the breast where the lumpectomy will be performed. This study will determine if radiation therapy delivered in this manner will prevent the cancer from coming back and eliminate the need for five to six weeks of radiation.

The primary endpoint is the difference in efficacy of tamoxifen defined as the objective response rate using RECIST criteria between women with a normal versus low Tamoxifen Activity Score (TAS) after 3-6 months of tamoxifen use. The TAS score is based on the presence of genetic variations and drug interactions. Secondary endpoints are time to progression clinical benefit serum metabolite concentrations endometrial changes and menopausal symptoms. Patients using tamoxifen in the neoadjuvant setting needs being operated between 4-6 months following the start of tamoxifen.    ,NCT00965939
Breast Cancer,Assessment of Genomic Test Impact on Shared Decision of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in ER-positive Her2-negative Early Breast Cancer," The need/benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy could be negligible for a certain category of patient with newly diagnosed unilateral non metastatic breast cancer. Physicians are sometimes divided between the administration of adjuvant treatment and no administration when the risk of distant relapse at 10 years is around 10% with uncertainty and a theoretical benefit of chemotherapy is less than 5% at 10 years according to guidelines in use in the center. Several genomic tests have been developed this last decade. These tests use a sample of breast cancer tissue to analyze the activity of a group of genes. Knowing whether certain genes are present or absent overly active or not active enough can help physicians predict the risk of recurrence. In addition to standard pathological characteristics a genomic test could be helpful in making treatment decisions such as whether or not chemotherapy should be part of the treatment plan. First generation prognostic tests are currently widely used worldwide to guide decision making regarding adjuvant chemotherapy (OncotypeDX??Mammaprint®). Prognostic tests have reached a level of evidence 1A with the results of the prospective randomized trial ""Mindact"". In the ""Mindact"" trial among women with early-stage breast cancer who were at high clinical risk and low genomic risk for recurrence the receipt of no chemotherapy on the basis of the 70-gene signature led to a 5-year rate of survival without distant metastasis that was 1.5 percentage points lower than the rate with chemotherapy. Given these findings approximately 46% of women with breast cancer who are at high clinical risk might not require chemotherapy. The health-economic value of such signatures in the general population of patients with localized breast cancer appears very low at current costs. Meanwhile next generation prognostic signatures have been developed that have integrated clinical parameters and suggest high added value beyond all standard and traditional characteristics including tumor burden grade Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) Her2 age and also standard assessment of proliferation. In this study the clinical utility of genomic tests (Endopredict® Prosigna® OncotypeDX® Mammaprint® assay) defined as impact on chemotherapy decision in the adjuvant setting in patients with ER-positive Her2-negative early breast cancer with uncertainty on the indication of chemotherapy using standard assessments will be compared.

Breast Cancer,Estradiol Levels in Patients Treated With Estring, Estrogen receptor positive breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer and anti-estrogen therapy has been shown to be very effective in preventing recurrence. Side effects of anti-estrogens are due to estrogen deprivation and include hot flashes mood changes and vaginal dryness/pain. Vaginal symptoms including pain dryness itching bleeding after intercourse and frequent urinary tract infections have been reported to cause significant morbidity in postmenopausal women and higher in breast cancer survivors on anti-estrogen therapy. Treatment options include vaginal lubricants Replens etc but unfortunately many women continue to have persistent symptoms. Local estrogen has been shown to be effective in post menopausal women (Estring or Vagifem) for their vaginal symptoms. There is a concern of using this in women with breast cancer given it may increase their blood estrogen levels. Studies done so far show have shown controversial results but majority of them report that blood estrogen levels do not change significantly. The major drawback of the studies was the sample size and inadequate accrual. The most recent trial reported showed no significant change in blood estrogen levels in women with breast cancer treated with aromatase inhibitors (anti-estrogen therapy) and were on vagifem for their vaginal symptoms. The authors reported results in 26 patients and reported no significant change in blood estrogen level. We propose to study the change in blood estrogen level when postmenopausal women with breast cancer who are currently on aromatase inhibitors are treated with Estring for their vaginal symptoms.    ,NCT01923298
Breast Cancer,A Study Evaluating INIPARIB in Combination With Chemotherapy to Treat Triple Negative Breast Cancer Brain Metastasis, The purpose of the study is to investigate the response rate for triple negative breast cancer patients with brain metastasis when INIPARIB is used in combination with irinotecan. Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.    ,NCT01173497
Breast Cancer,GDC-0941 and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Androgen Receptor-Negative Triple Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer, This phase I/II trial study evaluates the tolerability and best tolerated dose of the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 when given with the chemotherapy cisplatin. This study will also examine how well the combination of GDC-0941 and cisplatin work in treating patients with androgen receptor negative triple negative metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive cisplatin alone or cisplatin with GDC-0941 in the phase II portion. Those receiving cisplatin alone can receive GDC-0941 upon progression of their disease. Cisplatin is a chemotherapy which has been shown to be effective in treating triple negative breast cancer. Preclinical studies show that adding a PI3K inhibitor such as GDC-0941 to cisplatin may be a more effective treatment for breast cancer.    ,NCT01918306

Breast Cancer,A Study to See Whether Estrogen Can Slow the Growth of Some ER Positive Breast Cancers, Some breast cancers have estrogen receptors (ER+). The investigators know that some ER+ tumours can be cured by hormone therapy alone while other ER+ breast cancers cannot. Currently there is no perfect way to tell these groups apart nor do the investigators know why some respond when others do not. Research findings suggest that the two types of ER+ breast cancers differ in their response to estrogen with estrogen being toxic to one type and not the other. For those tumours that find estrogen toxic this may explain why tumours only start to grow when estrogen levels decrease after menopause. The purpose of this study is to see whether a two-week treatment of estrogen equal to pre-menopausal estrogen levels will decrease the rate at which patients' ER+ tumours grow. This will be done by comparing the growth rate in the tissue removed during standard of care surgery after patients have been treated with 7-14 days of estrogen prior to that surgery.    ,NCT02238808

Estrogen and progesterone are hormones that can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen and progesterone the body makes. Giving everolimus with a different type of hormone therapy may be an effective treatment for breast cancer in patients who progressed on everolimus with exemestane.    ,NCT02269670
Breast Cancer,Pharmacokinetically Guided Everolimus in Patients With Breast Cancer Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors or Kidney Cancer, This phase II trial studies how well real-time pharmacokinetic therapeutic drug monitoring works in preventing stomatitis from developing in patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or kidney cancer that are receiving a type of cancer drug called everolimus. Stomatitis is a common side effect of everolimus that causes inflammation of the mouth with or without oral ulcers and frequently leads to patients discontinuing the medication. Monitoring the blood levels of everolimus and making adjustments in a patient's dose may be able to decrease the incidence of stomatitis while maintaining the effectiveness of everolimus to treat the cancer.    ,NCT02273752

Breast Cancer,An Intervention to Decrease Fatigue Among Breast Cancer Survivors, This research project is being done to design and then test whether a 10 week program can help reduce the symptoms of being tired and fatigued among women who have had breast cancer. The pilot study will include 4 groups of women two groups of women from Baltimore and two groups of women from Washington County Maryland. Each group will have 5 to 6 women. The purpose of this pilot study is to help us find the best things to include in the program to help women who have had breast cancer and who have severe problems with fatigue that has lasted months to years after being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Following the pilot program we will conduct and evaluate (using a quasi-experimental design comparing fatigue scores before and after the intervention) the efficacy of the refined 10-week integrated mind/body medicine approach to reduce symptoms of fatigue among breast cancer survivors who have completed their adjuvant therapy. Four intervention groups (~12 women per group) will be conducted: two in the urban setting and two in the rural setting. We will assess fatigue symptoms at baseline immediately after the program 2 months and 6 months following completion of the program. We will compare mean baseline scores to post-intervention scores. The ultimate goal is to develop a non-pharmacologic holistic low risk intervention for improving symptoms of fatigue and thus improving quality of life among breast cancer survivors    ,NCT00273208

Breast Cancer,Effect of TIVA Propofol vs Sevoflurane Anaesthetic on Serum Biomarkers and on PBMCs in Breast Cancer Surgery," Surgery perioperative stress anaesthetics and analgesics may modulate the immunosurveillance mechanisms and overwhelm host defences that normally maintain a balance between immunity & carcinogenesis. This may lead to escape of cancer cells and tilt the scales toward a more protumorigenic microenvironment. Volatile agents in particular have been shown to exhibit profound immunosuppressive effects. In comparison propofol has a favorable profile and inhibits cancer cell activity. Determining ""cancer-protective"" role of TIVA with propofol presents an exciting window of opportunity that has potential to improve outcomes in cancer patients undergoing resection surgery    ",NCT03005860

Breast Cancer,1st Line Treatment of Bevacizumab-Taxane vs Bevacizumab-Exemestane in Metastatic Breast Cancer, In first-line metastatic breast cancer the bevacizumab-taxane to progression or toxicity is currently the standard treatment. In patients expressing hormone receptors it was shown that hormone therapy administered in maintenance after induction chemotherapy could have a benefit regarding the progression-free survival. The investigators make the hypothesis that there would be interest to discontinue treatment with taxane after 4 months and to begin hormone therapy while continuing maintenance bevacizumab. Exemestane was chosen because it has been shown potentially active in patients who progressed after letrozole anastrozole or tamoxifen.    ,NCT01303679

Breast Cancer,Cardiac Safety Study in Patients With HER2 + Breast Cancer," HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2 and more recently pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer. Unfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function. In this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed ""picture"" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months. We hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50% while on appropriate heart medications.

Breast Cancer,A Prospective Study of Breast Cancer Patients With Abnormal Strain Imaging," The Cardio-Oncology program at Northwestern offers care to cancer patients who develop cardiac toxicities from chemotherapy. Breast cancer patients with the tumor marker for HER2 necessitate treatment with anthracycline and/or trastuzumab and pertuzumab-based chemotherapies which are known to cause cardiac toxicities. Breast cancer patients will undergo a ""cardio-oncology echocardiogram"" which incorporates advanced left ventricular assessment by utilizing deformation or strain imaging during chemotherapy treatment for surveillance of cardiac toxicities. The aims of this project are:   1. To create a registry of both clinical and echocardiographic variables biomarkers and genetic analysis that will be used to develop a risk model to predict LV dysfunction in early stage breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with anthracycline and/or trastuzumab and pertuzumab-based chemotherapy regimens.   2. To propose a new management algorithm for initiation of prophylactic beta-blocker therapy for early stage breast cancer patients with preclinical cardiac toxicities demonstrated by strain parameters.   3. To determine if initiation of prophylactic beta-blocker therapy in patients with early cardiac toxicity can delay or prevent a drop in LV EF and the development of clinical heart failure.   4. To explore serial measurements of a suite of novel biomarkers during ongoing anticancer treatment that are presumed but not yet proven to be predictive of cardiac dysfunction in women with breast cancer.   5.

Breast Cancer,HER2 Imaging Study to Identify HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Patient Unlikely to Benefit From T-DM1," T-DM1  which is a highly innovative but also expensive antiHER2 agent consisting in the coupling of the humanised monoclonal antibody trastuzumab with a cytotoxic agent (maytansine derivate) has shown an encouraging antitumor activity evaluated by Recist criteria (35% objective response rate 44% stable disease 18% progressive disease) in patients with advanced HER2 positive Breast Cancer pretreated with several cytotoxic drugs trastuzumab and lapatinib. Rationale I :For TDM1 to be active the presence of an intact HER2 receptor is ""key"" since the internalization of the cytotoxic moiety depends on the binding of trastuzumab to the external domain of HER2. The zirconium 89 labelled trastuzumab PET/CT (or HER2 immunoPET/CT) is a non invasive test which shows promise in measuring HER2 expression (extracellular domain) for the entire disease burden and which could identify non responding patients prior to TDM1 administration. Rationale II: As for many such agents it is desirable to identify early on (here with the use of FDG-PET/CT) which patients are unlikely to benefit from the therapy    ",NCT01565200
Breast Cancer,Phase II Study of Eribulin Mesylate Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in Women With Metastatic Unresectable Locally Advanced or Locally Recurrent HER2-Positive Breast Cancer," In this study the investigators are testing the effectiveness of the combination of eribulin pertuzumab and trastuzumab to learn whether this combination of drugs works in treating advanced HER2-positive breast cancer that had received at least one prior treatment previously. At this point the standard treatment for HER2-positive cancer that has progressed (grown) after a first treatment is chemotherapy combined with therapies that target the HER2 protein (e.g. trastuzumab or lapatinib). All of the medications that are being tested in this study are approved by the Food and Drug administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. However the combination of these three medications in participants has not yet been tested. Eribulin is a chemotherapy agent that is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer for women who have previously received at least two prior chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of their metastatic disease. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are also both approved for the treatment of advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Both agents help treat breast cancer by binding HER2 receptor. However pertuzumab and trastuzumab bind to different parts of the HER2 receptor. The goal of this research study is to find out if adding pertuzumab trastuzumab and eribulin is effective in treating women with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. The Investigators will also gather more information on the side effects of these treatments The investigators also plan to gather genetic information from participants' tumors (collected at biopsies). Cancers occur when the molecules that control normal cell growth (genes and proteins) are altered. Changes in the tumor genes and in the genes of normal cells are called ""alterations."" Many of these alterations can be detected by directly examining cancer cells in a tumor or circulating in blood. Several alterations that occur repeatedly in certain types of cancers have already been identified. These discoveries have led to the development of new drugs that ""target"" those alterations. More remain to be discovered. Some of the alterations are found in genes. Genes are composed of DNA ""letters"" which contain the instructions that tell the cells in our bodies how to grow and work. Genes make proteins which actually carry out the instructions in our cells. The investigator would like to use your DNA to look for alterations in the genes in cancer cells and blood cells using a technology called ""sequencing."" Gene sequencing is a way of reading the DNA to identify errors in genes that may contribute to the behavior of cells. Some changes in genes occur only in cancer cells. Others occur in normal cells as well in the genes that may have been passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both kinds of genes. One of the scientific goals of this research study is to perform gene sequencing (gene tests) on your cancer cells (obtained from biopsies or surgery) and normal tissues (usually blood). The results of the gene tests will be used to try to develop better ways to treat and prevent cancers. As part of this work we may also learn things about the genes in your normal cells. However because interpretation of these tests will require further studythe investigator will not disclose these results to participants who participate on this component of the study.

Breast Cancer,A Study of Lapatinib in Combination With Caelyx in Patients With Advanced HER2 Positive Pretreated Breast Cancer, A Phase Ib Study of Lapatinib in Combination with Caelyx in Patients with Advanced HER2 positive pretreated Breast Cancer. Treatment Plan: Lapatinib is given at escalating doses orally and continuously on days 1-21. Caelyx is administered at escalating doses in a 60-minute i.v. infusion on day 1. Each cycle is defined as 21 days. Four dose levels are planned. Dose level -1 Caelyx 30 mg/mq & Lapatinib 1000 mg die; dose level 1 Caelyx 30 mg/mq & Lapatinib 1250 mg die; dose level 2 Caelyx 30 mg/mq & Lapatinib 1500 mg die; dose level 3 Caelyx 40 mg/mq & Lapatinib 1500 mg die. Three patients will be initially enrolled in each dose level starting from level 1. If none of the first triplet of patients will develop DLT the dose will be escalated to the next level for the subsequent three patients. If one of the first triplets of patients will develop first-course DLT a maximum of 3 additional patients will be entered at the same dose level. The MTD is defined as the dose below that at which two patients have experienced DLT. Lapatinib will be self-administered by the patient in an outpatient setting at the dose of the assigned step. Patients will take the drug daily by mouth on days 1 to 21 of each cycle. Caelyx will be administered by intravenous infusion over an exact period of 1 hour (preferably by a pump to guarantee a constant speed of infusion) on day 1 of each cycle repeated every 21 days. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY: Evaluation of toxicity: all patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with Caelyx and Lapatinib. Evaluation of response: all patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. Subanalyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of patients excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified .However these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported. The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided.    ,NCT02131506

Breast Cancer,UMCC 9901: Phase II Study of Tailored-Dose Docetaxel + Trastuzumab in Her-2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, This is a research study which aims to improve the way that doctors determine the dose of chemotherapy given to patients. Right now chemotherapy is determined by a patient's height and weight. However some patients metabolize chemotherapy faster or slower than the average person because of a different level of drug metabolizing enzyme in the liver. Therefore some patients are either given too small or too large a dose of chemotherapy because the amount of enzyme is not taken into account. This research study will examine the use of a simple test call the Erythromycin Breath Test(ERMBT) to determine the amount of enzyme which can metabolize the chemotherapy drug docetaxel (Taxotere). The dose of docetaxel will be tailored to the amount of enzyme which is available to metabolize the drug for each patient. The drug docetaxel is combined with another drug trastuzumab (Herceptin) because at this time this combination appears to be promising in metastatic breast cancer research.    ,NCT00146042
Breast Cancer,Phase 2 Study of Trastuzumab and Etoposide for Her2 Positive Breast Cancer, This study is for women and men who have previously treated metastatic (has spread to other parts in the body) Her2- positive breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) the FDA-approved drugs etoposide and trastuzumab have on this type of breast cancer and to determine if these drugs are safe to use together. This research is being done to find more effective treatment for this type of condition. In this study trastuzumab and etoposide will be given by intravenous infusion (IV; through a vein) on the first 3 days of every 3-week cycle. This is repeated for 6 cycles.

Breast Cancer,Capecitabine Cyclophosphamide Lapatinib Ditosylate and Trastuzumab in Treating Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, This phase II trial studies how well capecitabine cyclophosphamide lapatinib ditosylate and trastuzumab work in treating patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as capecitabine and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving capecitabine and cyclophosphamide daily may kill more tumor cells. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for growth. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of the tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving capecitabine cyclophosphamide lapatinib ditosylate and trastuzumab together may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.    ,NCT01873833
Breast Cancer,BYL719 + T-DM1 in HER2(+) Metastatic Breast Cancer Pts Who Progress on Prior Trastuzumab & Taxane Tx, The purpose of this study is to see whether a combination of two different drugs - trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (T-DM1) and BYL719 is safe and if it might be effective in treating metastatic breast cancer. T-DM1 is a type of drug that contains an antibody (trastuzumab) linked to chemotherapy. The antibody in T-DM1 targets a marker on breast cancer cells called HER2 which allows the drug to go directly to the cancer cells. The use of T-DM1 in this study is considered standard treatment for the type of cancer in this study. Participants in this study have already been treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in the past and their cancer has gotten worse in spite of those treatments. BYL719 is an oral drug (taken by mouth) that the researchers think may help T-DM1 to work better.    ,NCT02038010

Breast Cancer,Diarrhea Prophylaxis in Patients With HER2+ Breast Cancer Treated With Trastuzumab and Neratinib Followed by Neratinib Monotherapy, This is a study to evaluate the toxicity profile of neratinib in combination with trastuzumab in patients with early stage breast cancer with the use of anti-diarrheal prophylaxis. The anti-diarrheal medications being tested in this trial are loperamide and crofelemer. Crofelemer is an anti-diarrheal enteric-coated drug product for oral administration. It is the only botanical drug currently approved by the FDA for oral administration and is approved for the treatment of diarrhea associated with HAART. Crofelemer has a novel mechanism of action acting directly and simultaneously on 2 distinct intestinal luminal chloride channels. It is an inhibitor of both the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-stimulated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride ion (Cl-) channel found on the apical membranes and the calcium-activated Cl- channels (CaCC) at the luminal membrane of enterocytes. The CFTR Cl-channel and CaCC regulate Cl and fluid secretion by intestinal epithelial cells. Crofelemer acts by blocking Cl- secretion and accompanying high volume water loss in diarrhea normalizing the flow of Cl- and water in the GI tract.    ,NCT03094052

Breast Cancer,Enhancing At-risk Latina Women's Use of Genetic Counseling for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer, Compared to non-Latina Whites Latinas have a higher prevalence of BRCA1/2 gene mutations but lower use of genetic cancer risk assessments services (GCRA). This study will develop and assess the impact of a novel culturally targeted media intervention to improve psychosocial outcomes and GCRA use in Latinas at-risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. If the intervention is proven to be effective in a future randomized controlled trial the intervention can be disseminated to clinics and adapted to other ethnic groups.    ,NCT03075540
Breast Cancer,Telemedicine vs. Face-to-Face Cancer Genetic Counseling," Cancer genetic counseling (CGC) has been found to have ""substantial"" benefits for individuals with breast cancer and their family members; it has been deemed by multiple organizations as ""standard of care"" for women with breast cancer and their relatives. Unfortunately there is a disparity in access to CGC especially among women who live in rural and underserved areas. In North Carolina only two cancer genetic counselors practice in rural clinics - each only for a few days per month. Therefore in an effort to make CGC more widely available in a timely manner we propose to test provision of counseling through telemedicine (TM) in which a patient and health care provider communicate with each other using videoconferencing. In 4 rural oncology clinics we will implement low-cost TM and compare satisfaction and cost-effectiveness between groups of women designated to have their CGC session by TM or FTF. We'll use a validated measure to assess satisfaction by a phone survey one week after the CGC appointment; cost-effectiveness will be measured at project's end by calculating length of wait time for appointment and costs of equipment labor and mileage. Study hypothesis: TM is as satisfactory as FTF counseling and is a more cost-effective way to provide this beneficial service.    ",NCT00609505
Breast Cancer,Search Allelic Imbalance of Expression of BRCA Genes in Hereditary Risk of Breast and/or Ovarian Cancer, The purpose of this study is to determine proportion of patients presented a search allelic imbalance of expression of genes BRCA 1 and 2 in population with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer risk and negative for deletion mutation BRCA 1 and 2 genes    ,NCT01333748
Breast Cancer,Trial of Inquiry Based Stress Reduction (IBSR) Program for BRCA1/2 Mutation Carriers," Breast cancer (BC) is a major health problem and the most prevalent cancer among women.In a substantial proportion of familial cases germ-line mutations in either BRCA1/2 can be detected. The only proven modality for active risk reduction (rather than passive early detection) is prophylactic surgery - prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy. While the majority of Jewish mutation carriers elect to undergo prophylactic oophorectomy at about age 40 years in Israel only a minority perform prophylactic mastectomy. Another ramification of being a mutation carrier is the emotional stress associated with that discovery.Genetic information has profound implications for mutation carriers. The IBSR (Inquiry-based stress reduction) intervention developed by Byron Katie trains participants to reduce their perceived level of stress by self-inquiry of their thoughts and beliefs connected to stressful circumstances or symptoms. This meditative process named ""The Work"" enables the participants to identify and question the stressful thoughts that cause their suffering. The core of IBSR is simply four questions and a turnaround which is a way of experiencing the opposite of what the participant believes. This process is simple powerful and provides skills for self-inquiry and management of stressful thoughts that can be easily implemented in daily life [ ]. Therefore on the basis of previous data and beneficial observations we postulate that the clinical utility of IBSR mediation program may improve psychological and physical symptoms and quality of life among asymptomatic (oncologically healthy) BRCA1/ BRCA2 mutation carriers. Thus we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to scientifically investigate the effect of this intervention effects on BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.    ",NCT01367639

Breast Cancer,Impact of a Psychoeducational Intervention on Expectations and Coping in Young Women Exposed to a High HBOC Risk, Young female counselees (18-30 years) belonging to HBOC families with a known mutation on BRCA-genes or not receive a lot of information regarding their cancer risk. Information sources are numerous and sometimes contradictory. Unfortunately these women face these issues at a key moment of there identity construction (self relationship sexuality) while they are not yet concerned by health prevention measures. A special psychoeducational intervention was designed to help these women to better cope with these difficulties. Intervention consists in a week-end session in a thermal center (SPA) during which they will attend short conferences given by specialists (prevention measures prophylactic surgery assisted procreation epidemiology...) and participate to role games and group sharing. Intervention will be evaluated using self-questionnaires completed before intervention and during the following year.    ,NCT02705924
Breast Cancer,The Women Choosing Surgical Prevention (WISP) Trial, The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the changes in female sexual function between patients having interval salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy (ISDO) with those having risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in women who carry genetic mutations. Researchers also want to learn how these surgeries affect your quality of life. RRSO is the standard surgery for patients with certain types of genetic mutations where the fallopian tubes and ovaries are removed at the same time. ISDO is surgery to remove the fallopian tubes first then the ovaries are removed during a second later surgery. Most women with genetic mutations will be encouraged to remove the ovaries around the ages of 40 to 50. The decision in timing to remove your ovaries will be made with your doctor.    ,NCT02760849
Breast Cancer,Statewide Communication to Reach Diverse Low Income Women, Recruitment for prevention and early detection among health disparities populations represents a major challenge in chronic disease control. This effect is magnified for individuals at high risk for conditions such as genetic breast cancer or chronic hepatitis. Costs are typically high particularly given the common practice of developing a single outreach channel to address each disease or condition. In a randomized delayed intervention control trial the investigators tested a strategy to identify low-income women at high risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) outside the clinical setting and refer them to free genetic counseling.    ,NCT02956681

Breast Cancer,Facilitating Web-based Patient Decision Support: Decision About Medication to Lower Breast Cancer Risk, Background:   -  Chemoprevention is the use of preventive medications to reduce the risk of breast cancer for women who are at a high risk of developing the disease. Although the treatment has shown effectiveness in preventing cancer development chemoprevention is notably underutilized even by women who are at a high risk of developing breast cancer.   -  Researchers are interested in determining if better decision support mechanisms such as interactive Web sites can help to overcome some of the barriers to chemoprevention. Objectives: - To develop and test a prototype Web-based module that will provide decision support to women who are considering chemoprevention for breast cancer. Eligibility:   -  Women 35 years of age and older who are at high risk for breast cancer and whose doctor has recommended chemoprevention (either Tamoxifen or Raloxifene) and who have no other history of cancer (apart from non-melanoma skin cancer or precancerous cervical lesions).   -  Participants must have a working e-mail address and access to a computer with internet access and a telephone. Design:   -  Participants who are considering chemoprevention will be randomized to a Web-based decision support module or standard care online information resources.   -  Participation lasts two months and involves using the online resources provided and filling out questionnaires two times during the study (at the beginning and the end). The first time will be at the begin of the study.   -  No medical treatments are offered as a part of this study    ,NCT00906321

Breast Cancer,Neoadjuvant Biweekly Treatment Followed by Weekly Treatment of Breast Cancer, Neoadjuvant chemotherapy also termed primary induction or preoperative chemotherapy is defined as chemotherapy administered before locoregional treatment. It was first used in locally advanced breast cancer 30 years ago. Classically these tumors were treated with radical surgery and/or radiotherapy. However despite this aggressive local therapy most patients relapsed with distant metastases and eventually died. The aim of neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce the tumor volume in patients before surgical resection thus increasing the likelihood of breast conservation. More recently neoadjuvant therapy has been studied as a way of testing the relevance of biological markers in predicting disease outcome. At least six randomized trials have compared survival in patients managed with either the neoadjuvant or adjuvant approaches. Two of the smaller trials suggested a survival advantage for patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Other studies including the largest trial (1523 patients) run by the NSABP found no differences in disease-free and overall survival. Induction of a Microscopic path clinical response (pCR) should be one of the primary goals of neoadjuvant therapy because patients with no evidence of tumor cells in breast and lymph nodes after treatment may have a longer disease-free and overall survival. Biweekly and weekly regimens may enhance dose intensity by minimizing re-growth of cells between cycles of treatment. In fact dose dense regimens have even shown a survival benefit in an adjuvant setting in lymph node positive breast cancer made possible with use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). There is as yet no standard best neoadjuvant treatment. Generally patients receive AC (NSABP 14) on 3-weekly regimens in neoadjuvant setting. In addition incorporation of taxanes on a 3 weekly schedule has resulted in statistically higher pathological clinical response (CR). More recently weekly paclitaxel regimens have reported increased pathological responses compared to 3 weekly taxane regimens. Carboplatin has also emerged as an effective agent in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Moreover the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel has been found to be synergistic both in three-weekly regimens and weekly regimens. In fact combination of carboplatin paclitaxel and herceptin has demonstrated a survival advantage over paclitaxel and herceptin alone. The Phase III study the preliminary results of which were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium show that the addition of carboplatin to herceptin and paclitaxel resulted in a six-month improvement in the time it took for the disease to progress compared to the standard herceptin and paclitaxel regimen. The study found median survival in the herceptin and paclitaxel arm was 33.5 months while the group receiving the tripartite therapy had yet to reach that point after 36 months of follow-up. Furthermore the weekly regimens of these drugs have been found to have significantly improved tolerability over three weekly regimens. Therefore we propose to use 4 cycles of AC q 2 weeks as used in the dose dense adjuvant study with Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) support on days 3-9 of the cycle. After the completion of AC we plan to administer paclitaxel and carboplatin weekly for a total of 12 doses with one week rest after every 3 weeks of treatment over 12 weeks. Patients who are her-2 overexpressors by FISH will also receive Trastuzumab with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel as the combination TC±H has been found to be synergistic in advanced breast cancer with improved clinical outcome. In a separate trial GM-CSF was used in breast cancer patients treated with adriamycin based chemotherapy as the preferred growth factor in a neoadjuvant setting. The initial results are suggestive of improved survival of breast cancer patients given 6 versus 5 versus 4 cycles of chemotherapy with GM-CSF support. Higher dendritic cell (DC) trafficking showed a trend toward improved survival. Moreover intrapatient comparison before and after treatment showed that the percentage of S100+ DC significantly increased over the course of GM-CSF treatment. The results form the basis of current hypothesis that the primary tumor may be an in vivo antigenic stimulus for dendritic cell trafficking and that the combination of prolonged neoadjuvant chemotherapy with GM-CSF induced immune enhancement may contribute to better tumor control and better survival.    ,NCT00256243
Breast Cancer,Establishing an Inflammatory Breast Cancer Registry, Inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC) is an extremely rare aggressive form of breast cancer that disproportionately impacts young women. IBC often affects the skin of the breast as well as the breast itself making it appear inflamed. The purpose of this study is to collect data and information on IBC patients so that researchers can study factors associated with IBC. The data and information collected will be used to establish the IBC Registry a private cancer registry. Approximately 300 persons who are 18 years or older and who have been diagnosed with IBC will participate in this study. Participants will provide researchers with access to their medical and pathology records slides tissue and x-rays. They also will consent to a 15-minute telephone interview concerning general information about themselves and the initial manifestation of IBC and to a 30-minute interview about their medical history.    ,NCT00340158
Breast Cancer,Pilot Study of Inflammatory Breast Cancer in Egypt and Tunisia, One form of breast cancer known as inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is characterized by diffuse erythema (redness) and edema (peau d'orange) of the breast. This type of cancer is aggressive and poorly understood. It is rare in the United States (about 4 percent of cases) but more common in Egypt and Tunisia (up to 23 percent of cases). Conducting a case-control study of IBC is complicated by several factors including the lack of standardized criteria for IBC. In addition collecting pre-chemotherapy tissue and blood samples from IBC patients is difficult because treatment begins immediately after diagnosis. In this pilot study the National Cancer Institute will collaborate with two major cancer centers and two hospitals (in Egypt and Tunisia) to determine the feasibility of a case-control study of IBC. The study will assess the number and characteristics of IBC cases the feasibility of identifying cases at diagnosis and the availability of control subjects; will collect frozen pre-treatment tumor tissue from five IBC cases to determine whether RNA isolation is possible; will obtain digital photographs of the breasts of IBC cases; and will demonstrate collaboration between the institutions and personnel involved in the study. The study will last for approximately one year. Participating hospitals will identify IBC cases. Consenting patients will undergo a breast examination in which the examining surgeon will complete an Initial Examination Form (IEF). Digital photographs of the breasts (but not face) will be taken and linked to the study ID number. Tissue examination results will be entered into the IEF. For five selected cases additional pre-treatment tumor tissue will be collected and frozen. This pilot study will assess the availability of controls for a case-control study by investigating the number and type of admissions to the Ear Nose and Throat and Ophthalmology Departments at participating hospitals during 2000-2003 using computerized records.    ,NCT00344071
Breast Cancer,Sunitinib Malate Paclitaxel Doxorubicin Hydrochloride and Cyclophosphamide Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage IIB-IIIC Breast Cancer, This phase II trial studies how well giving sunitinib malate together with paclitaxel doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide before surgery works in treating patients with stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sunitinib malate together with combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed    ,NCT00513695

Breast Cancer,Pilot Study of Zirconium-89 Bevacizumab Positron Emission Tomography for Imaging Angiogenesis in Patients With Inflammatory Breast Carcinoma Receiving Preoperative Chemotherapy," This research study is a pilot study which tests the ability of an investigational compound to be used in humans for further studies. ""Investigational"" means that 89Zr-bevacizumab for PET/CT imaging is being studied. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved 89Zr-bevacizumab for PET/CT imaging for use in patients including people with your type of cancer. 89Zr-bevacizumab is a newly developed radiotracer. Radiotracers are compounds or drugs that are attached to small amounts of a radioactive substance. The amount of the compound or drug in a radiotracer is also very small. Radiotracers are used to make images of processes that are happening in the body but they do not affect how the body works. 89Zr-bevacizumab is made up of the drug bevacizumab and the radioactive substance zirconium-89 (89Zr). 89Zr-bevacizumab is used for an imaging procedure called positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). This radiotracer has been used in other research studies. Information from those other research studies suggests that 89Zr-bevacizumab-PET/CT imaging may be able to measure new blood vessel formation to determine where the cancer is in your body and if your cancer is being killed by chemotherapy.

Breast Cancer,Therapy for Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Using Doxil Paclitaxel and Cyclophosphamide With Avastin, This study will evaluate the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) to the sequential therapy of Doxil paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide with concurrent Avastin for patients with locally advanced invasive (T2T3 Nany M0) breast carcinoma. Also the study will evaluate the clinical and subclinical cardiotoxic effect(s) of this regimen assess how feasible and safe the study is. Survival without any progression of disease will also be calculated. A regimen of chemotherapy will be given to replicate the high rate of pCR seen with conventional chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Doxil will substitute the normally given doxorubicin. It is expected that the low effect or minimal effect of Doxil on cardiac function will minimize any additional risk of cardiotoxicity from Avastin. It is expected that clinical and subclinical rates of cardiotoxicity will be very low at the total doses to be given in this clinical trial.    ,NCT00635050

Breast Cancer,Axillary Node Dissection Versus no Dissection in Breast Cancer With Positive Sentinel Lymph Node, Data from cohorts prospective studies and one randomized trial (ASCOG Z0011) support the hypothesis that omission of additional axillary dissection in case of positive sentinel node has a limited impact on overall survival and relapse free survival. However these data are not sufficient enough to recommend as a standard of care to avoid axillary dissection in case of positive sentinel node. The ASCOG Z0011 trial has been closed before the end of inclusions and the predefined non inferiority margin was found to be too large (5% difference at 5 years for primary endpoint). Prospective randomized trial is then urgently mandatory before omission of axillary node dissection becomes a usual practice without a sufficient scientific level of proof. Indeed in several reviews the rate of omission of axillary node dissection in case of micrometastasis increased (Bilimoria) despite any strong proof has been demonstrated. The omission of axillary node dissection in case of positive sentinel node may have strong practical impacts on patients but also on medical and economical aspects: in avoiding a prolonged hospitalisation secondary morbidities due to axillary dissection requiring secondary care and their costs as well as costs for secondary axillary dissection (14 to 25% in case of positive sentinel node) and finally shortening surgery duration. The main investigator propose a Non Inferiority Randomized Multicenter Phase III Trial of Axillary Node Dissection Versus no Axillary Node Dissection in Case of Positive Sentinel Lymph Node in Invasive Breast Cancer    ,NCT01717131

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Predictive Factors Regarding the Effectivity of Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy (PreFace), Aromatase inhibitors have shown a superior efficacy compared to tamoxifen in the treatment of hormonal receptor positive breast cancer in postmenopausal patients. Side effects like osteoporosis bone fractures and muscle/bone pain are however more frequent using of aromatase inhibitors compared with tamoxifen. These side effects compromise the patients' well being in a significant way and may favour the use of Tamoxifen in clinical practice. Furthermore there is evidence that polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 Gene might be associated with an improved efficacy of Tamoxifen that is equieffective to aromatase inhibitors. Concerning the pharmacogenetics of aromatase inhibition there are known polymorphisms of the CYP19A1 gene that are associated with altered peripheral sex hormone levels and altered prognosis in breast cancer patients. One study could even associate a polymorphism in the CYP19A1 gene with a prolonged time to progression in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with letrozol. Therefore the aim of this study is to identify biomarkers that could predict the efficacy of an adjuvant Letrozol treatment in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.    ,NCT01908556

Breast Cancer,Pilot Investigation of Ultrasound Imaging and Spectroscopy and Ultrasound Imaging of Vascular Blood Flow as Early Indicators of Locally-Advanced Breast Cancer Response to Neoadjuvant Treatment," We have previously demonstrated that high-frequency ultrasound and spectroscopy and recently conventional-frequency ultrasound and spectroscopy may be used to detect cell death in vitro in situ and in vivo. The method can detect different forms of cell death and has been demonstrated to be sensitive to apoptotic necrotic and mitotic cell death. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the use of ultrasound imaging and spectroscopy as a predictive marker of advanced tumour response to combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Breast Cancer,Using Bio Markers to Predict Disease Recurrence and Cognitive Function in High Risk Breast Ca, Women with breast cancer undergo treatments that decrease the chance of recurrence of cancer but are associated with several side effects including declines in memory and attention and other thinking abilities. The causes of these declines are not known. However we know that (i) people with cancer may have high levels of molecules in the blood (cytokines) that reflect inflammation; (ii) injection of cytokines into animals and their use to treat some human diseases can lead to decreased memory and attention; and (iii) in some advanced cancers cytokines predict disease outcome. This longitudinal study evaluates the relation of cytokines to decreased thinking abilities and to disease outcome over time. Results of this study may help develop interventions to prevent or minimize cognitive decline and identify women who are at high risk for recurrence and such information could be used in treatment decisions and in the development of new treatment options.    ,NCT00756132

Breast Cancer,Characterization of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC-s) in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Stage IV Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to identify tumor cells in the bloodstream (Circulating Tumor Cells CTC's) from patient's with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer. Analyzing the tumor is helpful in guiding therapy; however research has suggested that the number of tumor cells found in the bloodstream (CTC's) signifies more aggressive behavior and increased difficulty in eliminating the cancer. This research will help to develop better ways to treat breast cancer which could be tailored to a patient and may be adjusted to a patient's individual needs.    ,NCT01048918
Breast Cancer,Comparative Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With and Without Zometa for Management of Locally Advanced Breast Cancers, Breast cancer is the leading female cancer by a very wide margin in France. Despite widespread breast cancer screening many cases of breast cancer are discovered at a locally advanced stage. The tumoral consequences of a cancer size greater than 3 cm are: increased risk of metastasis and death and most often impossibility of performing breast-conserving surgery (a mastectomy is usually advisable in case of a first surgical procedure). It is increasingly recommended to treat locally advanced breast cancers with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Very numerous studies have shown that by proceeding that way the oncologic prognosis was not harmed and on the contrary it was possible to obtain sufficient tumor response to allow breast-conserving treatment in more than 60% of cases. The use of zoledronic acid (Zometa) has an established place in the management of malignancies with a predilection for skeletal involvement (in particular metastasis). Although the main target of biphosphonates is the osteoclast there is also preclinical data indicating that biphosphonates can have effects on cells other than osteoclasts including tumor cells. Anti-tumor activity including inhibition of tumor cell growth and induction of tumor cell apoptosis inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and invasion and anti-angiogenic effects have been demonstrated. In addition several in vitro studies have shown that Zometa causes synergistic induction of breast cancer cell apoptosis when combined with clinically relevant concentrations of chemotherapy drugs such as paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Therefore testing of combinations of biphosphonates with these agents in breast cancer is of significant interest. In the context of locally advanced breast cancers the combination of a bisphosphonate with neoadjuvant chemotherapy appears to have an important potential: preventing possible bone metastases but also possibly amplifying the efficacy of the chemotherapy's tumoricidal activity both on the primary tumor and on potential metastatic localizations. So it appears that the use of bisphosphonates in a neoadjuvant situation presents a potentially favorable benefit-risk ratio. That is why we are proposing to perform a prospective randomized multicenter comparative study to evaluate 2 systemic neoadjuvant treatments one with Zometa and the other without Zometa in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Zometa will be administered according to the usual administration procedure: one infusion every 3 weeks. The therapeutic response will be evaluated by studying the different biological markers (circulating blood and bone marrow tumor cells serum cell apoptosis and neoangiogenesis markers bone resorption markers etc.) but also by analyzing clinical radiologic and histologic response and by breast conservation rates. The impact of other factors that may affect therapeutic response will be taken into account: aggressivity of the tumor presence or absence of tumor receptors tumor stage etc. The purpose of the study is to show a marked benefit of treatment with Zometa in managing locally advanced breast cancers with synergistic action of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy and improvement in the laboratory parameters of tumor aggressivity. These markers will be used as surrogate markers of long term outcome.    ,NCT01367288

Breast Cancer,A Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of Irosustat When Added to an AI in ER+ve Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer., 70% of breast cancers that occur in postmenopausal women rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow and are likely to respond to hormone treatment. This type of treatment reduces the amount of oestrogen in the body slowing the growth of cancer or stopping it altogether. One type of hormone treatment aromatase inhibitors (AIs) works by stopping the body from making oestrogen. Currently women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is not being controlled by one class of AI are switched to the other class of AI. The reason for this is that some cancer cells can become resistant to one class but are still sensitive to the other class. However oestrogen can be made in the body by two pathways and AIs block only one of these pathways. A new drug called Irosustat can reduce the production of oestrogen in the body by blocking the second pathway. This study is investigating whether adding Irosustat to AI treatment i.e. blocking both pathways at the same time can further reduce the amount of oestrogen in the body and therefore control the breast cancer better. 27 postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is not being controlled by their current AI treatment will be recruited in this study from 9 United Kingdom (UK) hospitals. Eligible patients will receive 40mg of Irosustat once daily in addition to the AI on which they progressed. Patients will receive Irosustat for as long as it controls their cancer or until they have side effects that stop them from taking treatment. Patients will be seen monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Participating patients will also be given the option to take part in the exploratory part of this study by donating tissue and blood samples.    ,NCT01785992
Breast Cancer,Monitoring of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Locally-Advanced Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to determine whether four new alternative imaging methods can be used to follow the response of breast cancer to the treatment patients are being given. These methods produce an image of the inside of the breast so that doctors can better decide whether breast cancer is responding to therapy. An important part of the study is to examine the same person with all methods in order to directly compare results. The four methods are: MRI Elasticity Imaging (abbreviated MRE) Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (abbreviated EIS) Microwave Imaging and Spectroscopy (abbreviated MIS) Near Infrared Spectroscopy (abbreviated NIR). In addition to the experimental imaging methods patients may also undergo a contrast-enhanced MRI and/or additional mammography which will help researchers compare the experimental methods. These additional examinations are accepted diagnostic procedures; they are not experimental. Some participants will have one or both of these additional examinations if clinically indicated.    ,NCT01837563

All participating cancer centers will prospectively include patients with breast cancer fulfilling the inclusion criteria. If patients do not respond to the experimental treatment as outlined in the protocol treatment with dose-dense cyclophosphamide will be terminated and further cancer treatment will continue at the treating oncologist's discretion. The response data for all patients who have received at least one chemotherapy course will be included in the final efficacy analysis. Tumor tissue blood samples and radiology data will be collected before therapy starts if therapy needs to be changed and for patients with locally advanced breast cancer: at surgery. Response data will be evaluated closely during treatment with clinical assessment of tumor size every two weeks for patients with locally advanced breast cancer and by radiology every eight weeks for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Evaluation of side effects/tolerance will be performed at every clinical visit i.e. every two weeks for all patients included in the p53 trial.    ,NCT02965950

Breast Cancer,Randomized Controlled Trial of Neo-adjuvant Progesterone and Vitamin D3 in Women With Large Operable Breast Cancer and Locally Advanced Breast Cancer, Randomized Controlled Trial of Neoadjuvant Progesterone and Vitamin D3 in women with Large Operable Breast Cancer and Locally Advanced Breast Cancer - A Feasibility Study Primary Progesterone Timing of surgery during the menstrual cycle and its impact on survival in premenopausal women with operable breast cancer has been extensively researched and reinvestigated by Badwe et al in the randomized clinical trial of 'Primary Progesterone Therapy for Operable Breast Cancer' at Tata Memorial Hospital. The underlying assumption was that the presence of unopposed estrogen (in follicular phase) at the time surgery may be deleterious for survival and that circulating progesterone might counteract this deleterious effect. Vitamin D3 The most prominent physiological role of hormonally active form of vitamin D3 125-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (125(OH)2D3 or calcitriol) is regulation of calcium and phosphorous homeostasis and bone metabolism via an intracellular receptor (VDR) which is a member of steroid thyroid hormone super-family of receptors. The VDR receptors are also found in other tissues like breast and prostate. Vitamin D compounds have also been implicated in promotion of apoptosis in breast cancer cells and evidence suggests that 125(OH)2D3 and its synthetic analogues may potentiate responsiveness of breast cancer cells to conventional cytotoxic agents. Objectives   1. To see the effect of primary progesterone on survival in women with high risk breast cancer (large operable and locally advanced breast cancer)   2. To see the effect of Vitamin D3 as an antiproliferative cytotoxic and apoptotic agent (negative growth regulator) by evaluation of surrogate markers of proliferation and apoptosis. Inclusion Criteria:   -  Unilateral breast cancer   -  Large operable breast cancer/LOBC (T3N0M0 or T3N1M0) and Locally advanced breast cancer/LABC (T3N1-2M0; T2N2M0)   -  Age <70 years   -  Fit for CT Exclusion Criteria:   -  Prior Incision Biopsy or Excision Biopsy   -  Metastatic breast cancer   -  Renal failure or deranged Renal Function Test   -  Hypoparathyroidism   -  Pregnant or lactating mothers or women of childbearing age not practicing contraception   -  Patient on any of the following drugs: Magnesium-containing antacids Digitalis Phenytoin barbiturates Thiazide diuretics.   -  Previous history of other cancers except cured skin and cervical carcinoma in situ. Methodology / Treatment plan The study drugs (Injectable Progesterone and Vitamin D3) will be tested in the neoadjuvant setting prior to administration of each chemotherapy cycle in a 2x2 factorial design as below: Neoadjuvant D3 will be administered as Inj. Arachitol 300000 IU/ml intramuscular before each chemotherapy cycle.

Breast Cancer,Using Test of SCM for Detection Breast Cancer," In our previous research we have shown that women that have breast cancer have a population of lymphocytes that recognizes specific antigen and there cytoplasmic matrix goes through physical change a short time after exposure in vitro to the same antigen. This change can be measured by polarization changes of fluorescent light emitted by FDA (fluorescein diacetate) labeled cells. Further test that we performed showed that those differences are also shown in a benign situation that known as indicator for a high risk for developing breast cancer within 10-15 years. The incidence of the expression of these lymphocytes correlates with the histopathological picture as it is related in high risk for the developing the disease. In this work we will expand the scope of the procedure to early detection of the cancerous process in breast lesions by Fitzgibbon's risk categories for the development invasive carcinoma of the breast. In the proposed work we intend to use specific antigen MUC1 for breast cancer. This study is a continuation of our published work in the ""The Breast ""    ",NCT00407706

Breast Cancer,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Physical Exercise for Climacteric Symptoms in Breast Cancer Patients Experiencing Treatment-Induced Menopause: a Multicenter Randomized Trial, Background: Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women in the Netherlands. Approximately 11000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer annually of whom about 30% are below 50 years of age. Premenopausal women with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy may experience a premature onset of the menopause. Estrogen deficiency following adjuvant treatments leads to primary endocrine symptoms including vasomotor and urogenital problems. Secondary symptoms include insomnia due to night sweats dyspareunia due to vaginal dryness weight gain and psychological distress. The symptoms resulting from accelerated estrogen withdrawal can be pronounced and severe and may adversely affect women's sexual functioning body image and overall HRQL. Healthy women who enter natural menopause are often prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to alleviate vasomotor and sexual symptoms. However due to possible tumor-promoting effects HRT is contraindicated for patients with a history of breast cancer. For these women non-hormonal medications are frequently prescribed to treat vasomotor symptoms. Although these medications have been shown to yield moderate symptom relief they also have a number of bothersome side effects. To alleviate urogenital symptoms local vaginal moisturizing or estrogen cream is often prescribed. There is growing evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including relaxation techniques and physical exercise may effectively reduce vasomotor symptoms in naturally occurring menopause. CBT and relaxation techniques are aimed primarily at the modification of precipitants of hot flushes and at stress management. Physical exercise on a regular basis affects neurotransmitters which regulate central thermoregulation. Purpose: The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy of a supportive intervention program in alleviating menopausal symptoms improving sexual functioning and enhancing the quality of life of younger women (< 50 years) with breast cancer who have become prematurely menopausal as a result of their treatment. Specifically the study will evaluate CBT including relaxation (A) physical exercise (B) and a combination of A and B. Plan of investigation: This multicenter study will employ a prospective full-factorial design. In total 325 consenting women will be randomized to group A group B group AB or a usual care 'waiting list' control group (N = 81-81 per group). Upon completion of the study the patients assigned to the control group will be given the opportunity to undergo either the A or B intervention program. The program will begin with a structured assessment of the target symptoms: hot flushes night sweating and vaginal dryness. The overriding goal of the intervention is to provide symptomatic women with information skills and support to manage their symptoms more effectively. For group A the intervention will consist of 6 weekly group CBT sessions of 1.5 hours of 15 minutes of daily homework and a booster session at 3 months. The CBT will focus on understanding and self-control of menopausal symptoms. Relaxation techniques (paced respiration and muscle relaxation) will focus on the reduction of sympathetic nervous system activity and are expected to have a positive impact on the frequency and intensity of hot flushes. For group B the intervention will be an individually tailored 12 week home-based physical exercise program of 2.5-3 hours per week with instructions provided in-clinic on 2 occasions and telephone support on 2 additional interim occasions. The physical exercise program is intended to enhance fitness levels in general and to improve thermoregulation specifically related to hot flushes. Group AB will receive both the CBT and exercise program elements. Women allocated to the intervention groups will be asked to complete a battery of questionnaires assessing menopausal symptoms (the primary outcome) sexuality body- and self-image psychological distress and generic HRQL prior to the start of the program (baseline T0) at 12 weeks (T1) and at 6 months follow-up (T2). Women allocated to the control group will complete the same questionnaire battery at parallel points in time. Results/ relevance: If demonstrated to be effective the availability of a structured supportive intervention program (modules A B or AB) will be a welcome addition to regular medical care offered to breast cancer patients with treatment-induced menopause. It is anticipated that such a program will have direct benefit in terms of symptoms relief and the improvement of patients' HRQL.    ,NCT00582244
Breast Cancer,Metabolic Syndrome as Modifiable Risk Factor for Breast Cancer, Healthy women and women with breast cancer have been enrolled in our nested case-control study between 2008 and 2009 in order to evaluate the association between metabolic syndrome and breast cancer analyzing anthropometric parameters blood pressure assessing serum HDL-C triglyceride fasting plasma glucose insulin testosterone and uric acid levels and administering a questionnaire about physical activity food intake tobacco use alcohol abuse personal and familial history of disease. Our data support the hypothesis that metabolic syndrome may be an indicator of breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. The change of the hormonal arrangement in postmenopausal along with an increase in visceral adiposity probably favour the hormone dependent cell proliferation which drives tumorigenesis. Adjustments in lifestyle with physical activity intensification and healthy diet may represent modifiable factors on which sporadic breast cancer primary prevention may work on.    ,NCT01172886

Breast Cancer,Companion Pharmacogenetic Study to UMCC 9900/9901, The purpose is to examine the original breast tumor material to see how much of a metabolizing enzyme (CYP3A4) is present in tumor material. The researchers want to see if this is in any way associated with how the patient responded to docetaxel. They also want to examine the genes in the tumor that are responsible for the production of CYP metabolizing enzymes to see if they are normal or if they have polymorphisms or change compared to 'normal' CYP metabolizing enzymes.    ,NCT00146029
Breast Cancer,Phase II Study of Tailored-Dose Docetaxel in Metastatic Breast Cancer, This is a research study which aims to improve the way that doctors determine the dose of chemotherapy given to patients. Right now chemotherapy is determined by a patient's height and weight. However some patients metabolize chemotherapy faster or slower than the average person because of a different level of drug metabolizing enzyme in the liver. Therefore some patients are either given too small or too large a dose of chemotherapy because the amount of enzyme is not taken into account. This research study will examine the use of a simple test call the Erythromycin Breath Test(ERMBT) to determine the amount of enzyme which can metabolize the chemotherapy drug docetaxel (Taxotere). The dose of docetaxel will be tailored to the amount of enzyme which is available to metabolize the drug for each patient.    ,NCT00148070

Breast Cancer,Safety Study of a New Schedule of Capecitabine and Docetaxel to Treat Cancers, The combination of capecitabine and docetaxel is given to treat several different types of cancer. Capecitabine is usually given by mouth for 14 days and docetaxel is given IV on the first day of capecitabine. The effects of changes in the schedule of the combination of docetaxel and capecitabine has been examined in human breast cancer cells. A capecitabine by-product was given orally to breast cancer-bearing animals for 14 consecutive days. Docetaxel was given IV at a variety of times between days 1 and 15. The greatest reductions in the volume of the cancer were seen when animals were treated with docetaxel between days 6 and 10. In two other breast cancer models the maximal degree of delay in growth of the tumors was achieved when the animals were treated with docetaxel on day 8 of a 14 day course of capecitabine. The extent of tumor response was not explained by changes in tumor levels of the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase which is thought to be the mechanism behind the interaction of capecitabine and docetaxel. In the breast cancer cells capecitabine increases the level of proteins which promote death of cancer cells and it inhibits the levels of proteins which block death of cancer cells. Our hypothesis is that capecitabine and docetaxel interact with each other because capecitabine primes the pro-death machinery of the cell by increasing the ratio of death-promoting proteins to death-inhibiting proteins. Cells are more susceptible to killing by docetaxel when the pro-death machinery is activated by capecitabine. This is a safety study to find the highest dose of capecitabine that can be given safely for 14 days in combination with docetaxel given at a fixed dose on day 8. Once this dose of capecitabine has been determined an additional nine patients with tumors that can be biopsied will be treated at this dose and levels of capecitabine its byproducts and docetaxel will be measured in the bloodstream. Biopsies of tumors will also be taken before and after the docetaxel is given and the levels of pro-death and anti-death proteins will be measured.    ,NCT00169000
Breast Cancer,Effects of Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor (G-CSF) Trastuzumab and Vinorelbine on Immune Cell Function, Trastuzumab or Herceptin is an antibody directed against Her-2. Her-2 is a growth factor receptor which is present on the tumors of 25% of patients with breast cancer. The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy has been shown in a randomized clinical trial to increase the response rate to chemotherapy the duration of response to chemotherapy and to improve the duration of survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The anticancer mechanism of action of trastuzumab is unknown but it is possible that trastuzumab acts by promoting antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or direct killing of cancer cells by immune cells triggered by antibodies bound to the surface of the cancer cell. G-CSF is a drug which is a growth factor for certain types of immune cells. G-CSF has two favorable effects on ADCC. G-CSF increases the pool of circulating cancer-killing immune cells and G-CSF increases the strength of binding of cancer-killing immune cells to a specific part of the antibody. Therefore priming with G-CSF significantly increases the efficiency of ADCC and four days of treatment with G-CSF has been shown to optimize ADCC in some studies. Recent data from the investigators' laboratory indicates that chemotherapy can augment ADCC directed against tumor cells. The investigators' hypothesis is that pre-treatment with the drug G-CSF would increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy given with trastuzumab.    ,NCT00169104

Breast Cancer,Serum Proteomics to Predict Gemcitabine Sensitivity in Breast Cancer, Tumors are heterogeneous with varying response to chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesize that tumors that are sensitive to a particular chemotherapeutic agent have a distinctive tumor protein profile compared to those that are resistant. We further hypothesize that since tumor is continuously perfused by serum serum protein profile can be used as a surrogate marker of tumor protein profile. The primary objective of this study is to identify a serum protein profile that predicts gemcitabine/carboplatin sensitivity or resistance in breast cancer patients with prior exposure to anthracyclines and taxanes. Secondary objectives are to establish the serum protein profile of breast cancer patients who have had prior exposure to anthracyclines and taxanes and to study the pharmacogenetics of gemcitabine toxicity by correlating germline genotype of transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes with plasma and intracellular gemcitabine pharmacokinetics.    ,NCT00212069

Breast Cancer,Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, In vitro data suggest synergy between oxaliplatin and 5-FU. The combination of oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil produced objective response rates ranging from 27-34% in two studies of patients with prior chemotherapy. Capecitabine was designed as an orally administered tumor selective fluoropyrimidine preferentially converted to 5-FU at the tumor site by the higher levels of pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (PyNPase) in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. The end result is higher concentrations of 5-fluorouracil in tumor relative to surrounding normal tissue. This trial will investigate the activity of this novel capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) combination in patients with advanced disease. In addition an exploratory analysis will correlate response with thymidine synthase and thymidine phosphorylase expression in primary tumor samples.    ,NCT00216021
Breast Cancer,Capecitabine Oxaliplatin and Trastuzumab in Treating Patients With HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, In vitro data suggest synergy between oxaliplatin and 5-FU. The combination of oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil produced objective response rates ranging from 27-34% in two studies of patients with prior chemotherapy. Capecitabine was designed as an orally administered tumor selective fluoropyrimidine preferentially converted to 5-FU at the tumor site by the higher levels of pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (PyNPase) in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues.

Breast Cancer,Lapatinib in Metastatic Breast Cancer Resistant to Hormone Therapy, Two thirds or more of breast cancers are dependent on estrogen for growth. We use a number of estrogen-blocking medicines for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The treatment response to these agents is unpredictable however and approximately one-third of patients with metastatic breast cancer with receptors for estrogen or progesterone have no benefit from hormonal therapy. Nearly all patients with metastatic breast cancer will eventually become resistant to hormonal therapy despite the fact that the hormone receptors are still present. Some cells make a different class of growth factor receptor called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. There is a growing body of experimental evidence showing that breast cancer cells that make Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors are more resistant to hormonal therapy and have a poorer prognosis. Several investigators have found that the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor can activate the estrogen receptor even in the presence of estrogen-blocking drugs. Growth of these cells can be slowed by blockade of both Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor signaling and estrogen-receptor signaling. Lapatinib is a small molecule which can inhibit two different forms of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. It has been studied in people with a number of different cancers including breast cancer and a safe dose and its common side effects have been defined. Our hypothesis is that the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor is the dominant receptor pathway used by breast cancers in our patients with hormone-resistant tumors. Drugs like lapatinib which block several forms of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor would best be able to reverse resistance to hormonal agents.    ,NCT00225758

Breast Cancer,Letrozole in the Treatment of 1st and 2nd Line Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer: Pre-therapeutic Risk Assessment, The course of the disease in female patients with metastatic mammary carcinoma can vary greatly. In this connection the individual prognosis depends on a complex interaction of tumor- and patient-related factors. To take account of such differences it is necessary to employ individual methods of treatment which are suited to the course of each patient's disease. Prof. Possinger and Dr. Schmid (Charite Berlin) and Prof. Wischnewsky (University of Bremen) have developed an approach that can help to achieve this goal with the aid of computerized machine learning techniques (MLT). The use of machine learning methods can be beneficial in oncology in two respects. On the one hand an attempt can be made to individually estimate clinically relevant parameters like for example the recurrence probability or expected survival time as precisely as possible based on the established prognostic factors. And on the other hand it may be possible with the aid of MLT to understand structural relationships between the clinical result and measured or established tumor-/patient-related variables. To analyze the possible benefits of machine learning techniques for patients with metastatic breast cancer the aim of study FEM-D-2 is to investigate whether it is possible to characterize those patients who either do or do not respond to a specific treatment with a precision of 90% prospectively estimate the time until worsening of the disease under a given treatment and classify patients in groups with favorable and poor chances of medium-term survival. The use of inductive learning algorithms with machine learning also makes it possible to very accurately estimate the time until progression of the tumor growth. In patients who respond to letrozole therapy the time until tumor progression depends on factors like pain age body mass index disease-free interval main localization of metastatic spread and response to previous estrogen therapy. Only very minimal differences are found when comparing the actual time until progression of the disease and that calculated by the system (at least for survival times < 1 year). Furthermore using machine learning techniques it has become possible to use initial data assessed before a letrozole treatment to estimate the survival time and distinguish patients with a high risk of dying soon from other patients with a more favorable prognosis.    ,NCT00241046

Breast Cancer,Androgen Therapy for Management of Estrogen/Progesterone Receptor Negative ER(-)PR(-) Metastatic Breast Cancer, This study is for patients with breast cancer that has spread to other tissues and organs. The purpose of this study is to identify patients who may respond favorably to certain types of hormonal therapy. Researchers will study your tumor which was removed during your breast surgery. They will look for the presence or absence of Androgen (AR) receptors. These tests are for research purposes only. They will not affect the treatment of your breast cancer. The presence or absence of Androgen receptors on the tumor does not alter the therapy that is offered to patients. Recent evidence suggests that AR+ tumors are more likely to be destroyed when treated with androgen drugs. We will ask about 35 ER-/PR- breast cancer patients from Legacy Health System to be in this study. All tests and procedures are done as an outpatient in the doctor's office a clinic or at the hospital. The study drug that will be used in this trial is Androxy® a synthetic androgen hormone. Androgens have been shown to inhibit the growth of some breast cancer cells. Arimidex is an aromatase inhibitor that will be used in conjunction with Androxy to inhibit the in vivo production of estrogen. It is hoped that the combination of these two drugs will inhibit the growth of your tumor and possibly cause it to shrink.    ,NCT00303615

Breast Cancer,Phase I Study of Aprotinin in Advanced Breast Cancer, There is an intimate relationship between processes which promote growth invasion and metastasis of cancers and processes which regulate blood clotting. The enzymes uPA and PAI-1 are key regulators of the remodeling of recently formed blood clots and there is substantial information linking greater levels of uPA and PAI-1 in breast cancers with a greater likelihood of breast cancer recurrence and death. As uPA and PAI-1 are excellent markers for a cancer's aggressive clinical behavior uPA and PAI-1 may be potential targets for anticancer therapy. Aprotinin is an inhibitor of uPA activation and has been approved by the FDA to reduce blood loss in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Studies in animals and limited studies in patients have shown that Aprotinin slows the growth of tumors. Our hypothesis is that uPA is chronically activated in malignancies and that inhibition of uPA by Aprotinin would slow the rate of progression of breast cancer.    ,NCT00354900
Breast Cancer,Study to Determine the Utility of FES-PET and FDG-PET in the Prediction of Response to Hormone Therapy in Women With Estrogen Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, This study of hormone positive (estrogen receptor [ER]) metastatic invasive ductal breast cancer looks at functional scanning using positron emission tomography (PET) and patient response to hormone therapy. Functional scans allow investigators to see more than one metastatic location. The investigators will use an estrogen based agent (FES) to see the number of hormone positive metastases and compare that to positive lesions on routine glucose (FDG) based scanning. FES and FDG-PET results will be compared to give a FDG to FES ratio. The PET ratio will be calculated before hormone therapy and at relapse after treatment. The investigators will biopsy an accessible lesion that is FDG positive and FES negative and perform pathological testing for ER and PR positivity and compare it to the original primary tumor ER/PR. The investigators will test the lesion for tumor proliferation (using Ki-67) and aggressiveness using human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). Results will be compared to the primary tumor Ki-67 and HER-2 to determine concordance. The investigators will have pre-treatment results for FES and FDG-PET will calculate the ratio and will correlate it to the primary metastatic lesion and test for ER/PR Ki-67 and HER-2 and subsequent response to therapy. The investigators will determine the FES-PET predictive value for determining appropriateness of hormone therapy for metastatic disease. With these results the investigators plan to undertake future tumor biomarker/PET studies in metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT00358098

Breast Cancer,Standard Versus Continuous Capecitabine in Advanced Breast Cancer, Capecitabine is active in metastatic breast cancer but the conventional schedule (1250 mg/m2/12 hr 2 weeks on one week off) produces grade 2 or greater hand and foot syndrome in up to 50% of patients leading to those reductions. There are theoretical reasons to administer S-phase specific agents in continuous protracted rather than intermittent schedules. The investigators study compares the standard schedule (1250 mg/m2/12 hr 2 weeks on one week off) with a continuous administration schedule (800 mg/m2/12hr). The latter administer approximately the same cumulative dose of capecitabine as the standard schedule. The study hypothesis is that grade 2 or greater hand and foot syndrome will be reduced from 50% (standard arm) to 20% (experimental arm). The investigators assume similar antitumor activity in both arms.    ,NCT00418028

Breast Cancer,ZD6474 (Zactima) and Metronomic Chemotherapy in Advanced Breast Cancer, The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of Zactima with metronomic chemotherapy. Zactima is an oral anti-angiogenesis drug which means it fights cancer by cutting off a tumor's blood supply. Thus the drug starves the tumor by preventing the delivery of nutrients and oxygen. Metronomic chemotherapy is low dose oral chemotherapy pills which are taken daily. Unlike traditional chemotherapy metronomic chemotherapy is thought to fight cancer like Zactima by cutting off the blood supply to tumors. Because the dose is very low the side effects are generally mild and very different from those with higher dose chemotherapy given by vein.    ,NCT00496665
Breast Cancer,PTC299 and Hormonal Agent for Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer, Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is important for tumor growth in metastatic breast cancer. It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there are higher levels of VEGF in the tumors and blood of many women with metastatic breast cancer. VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral drug that has been shown to decrease production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models oral PTC299 administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream decreases blood vessel numbers in the tumor and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. Safety studies in research animals indicate good tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than those planned for the clinical studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers indicate that PTC299 achieves levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active in animal models of human cancer. This Phase 1b study is designed to test the hypothesis that PTC299 will be tolerable and will show evidence of VEGF reduction and antitumor activity when administered orally in combination with anastrozole (Arimidex®) letrozole (Femara®) or exemestane (Aromasin®) to women with metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT00508586

Ertumaxomab is a trifunctional bispecific antibody targeting Her-2/neu on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells. Trifunctional antibodies represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new antibody class has the capability to redirect T cells and accessory immune effector cells (e.g. macrophages dendritic cells [DCs] and natural killer [NK] cells) to the tumor site. According to preclinical data trifunctional antibodies activate these immune cells which can trigger a complex anti-tumor immune response.    ,NCT00522457

Breast Cancer,Phase I/II Study of MK-0752 Followed by Docetaxel in Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer," New and better therapies for locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer are needed because even if standard treatment is successful in shrinking the cancer there is still a high chance that the cancer will recur. Recent research suggests that breast tumors have a small number of cells in them that are ""breast cancer stem cells"" which are very resistant to standard treatment. It is thought that the reason that many patients cannot be cured of their breast cancers is that the stem cells are unable to be killed and remain in the body after standard treatment. Laboratory research has shown that a new drug MK-0752 can target stem cells and prevent tumor recurrences when the drug is combined with docetaxel a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat breast cancer. We know that MK-0752 is safe when given by itself to people. We do not know if treatment with MK-0752 and docetaxel combined is safe or if it will kill ""breast cancer stem cells"" in people with breast cancer. This clinical trial is being done to determine the safety of several doses of MK-0752 in combination with docetaxel. Preliminary data about the effectiveness of MK-0752 in combination with docetaxel will be collected. Also tumor biopsy samples will be taken from some patients who have tumors that can be easily biopsied. The samples will be used to perform research tests to help determine if the ""breast cancer stem cells"" are being killed by the drug combination.    ",NCT00645333

Breast Cancer,A Phase I Cancer Vaccine Study for Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer," The study uses a molecule or particle that is found only on cancer cells and is unique to cancer cells as it is not detected on normal tissue. The molecule is known as ""oncofetal antigen"" or OFA. Because OFA is unique to cancer the investigators feel OFA could be used to educate the patients' own defenses to more effectively fight the cancer on her own he or she is harboring. Although investigators found OFA to be present in large concentrations on all cancers it was found to be especially abundant in breast cancers. Therefore the investigators feel that this molecule would be a good target for stimulating patient defenses especially against breast cancer cells. To accomplish this certain defense cells (immune cells) will be washed out from the patients' blood using a machine to which the patient is connected through two small cannulas placed into veins located in the patients' arms. Those cells will be manipulated in the laboratory with artificially engineered OFA. These ""reeducated"" cells will be injected into the skin of patients. There will be a series of three skin injections in 4 week intervals. It is hoped that this treatment will convert the patients' defenses to a point that effective anti cancer responses will be induced. Effectiveness of the treatment will be monitored with blood tests and assessment of the size of the cancers.    ",NCT00715832

Breast Cancer,Faslodex Registry: Fulvestrant in Current Clinical Practice, The sequential administration of endocrine therapies to patients with advanced breast cancer requires the availability of therapies with different modes of actions so that tumours developing resistance to one agent are not cross resistant to another. Because of its mechanism of action fulvestrant is distinct from other hormonal therapies which therefore limits the possibility of cross-resistance with other therapies such as tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors (AIs)   -  In this way patients may benefit from an extended period of endocrine treatment which has considerable tolerability and quality-of-life advantages over cytotoxic chemotherapy.   -  In Belgium fulvestrant is indicated for treating postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with recurrence during or after adjuvant anti-oestrogen therapy or disease progression during anti-oestrogen treatment. However little information is currently available on how fulvestrant is actually being used by physicians in Belgium. The optimum sequence of endocrine treatment for advanced breast cancer has yet to be defined and may depend on certain patient or disease characteristics. Fulvestrant has been granted reimbursement by the Belgian Health authorities (RIZIV/INAMI) with the recommendation to collect the real life data necessary to assess the patients' breast cancer treatment history that may influence the actual endocrine treatment sequence according to physicians current clinical practice..    ,NCT00735215
Breast Cancer,Lapatinib in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Failed Prior Antihormone Therapy, Hormone receptor positive breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer comprising 70-80% of all breast cancers. Endocrine therapy is the main type of initial treatment for patients with your type of breast cancer. Endocrine therapy is treatment that tries to remove or block certain hormones from binding to the cancer cells and thus slow or stop the growth of cancer. Although most patients with your type of breast cancer respond initially to endocrine therapies it can lose its effectiveness. New therapies for this type of cancer are needed.    ,NCT00759642

Breast Cancer,Carboplatin and Bevacizumab for Progressive Breast Cancer Brain Metastases, The purpose of this research study is to determine how well the combination of bevacizumab and carboplatin works in treating breast cancer that has spread to the brain. Bevacizumab is an antibody (a protein that attacks a foreign substance in the body) that is made in the laboratory. Bevacizumab works differently from the way chemotherapy drugs work. Usually chemotherapy drugs attack fast growing cancer cells in the body. Bevacizumab works to slow or stop the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors. When the blood supply is decreased the tumors don't get the oxygen and nutrients they need to grow. Carboplatin is in a class of drugs known as platinum-containing compounds and has been approved for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Information from other research studies suggests that the combination of bevacizumab with carboplatin may be effective in treating breast cancer.    ,NCT01004172

Breast Cancer,Triple Negative Breast Cancer Biomarker Study, Patients with metastatic or locally recurrent triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who are scheduled for medically indicated surgical biopsy or resection of disease will be identified. Fresh/frozen tissue will be collected and will undergo comprehensive molecular evaluation with NextGen sequencing. TGEN's clonal genomics analyses will be applied in the analysis to identify and prioritize the mutated targets. Therapeutic options based on the genetic profile of each patient's tumor will be discussed and an appropriate molecularly-selected agent will be recommended by the Study Investigator(s) (SI) and treating oncologist as treatment for the patient. This is an open-label pilot trial. Patients with metastatic or locally recurrent TNBC who are scheduled for medically indicated surgical biopsy or resection will be enrolled and therapeutic options based on the genetic profile of each patient's tumor will be discussed with the patient. Time-to-progression (TTP) for these patients following the selected therapy is the primary objective and will be compared to the TTP(s) for their most recent prior therapy. A 30% increase in TTP with the molecularly-targeted agent compared with the TTP on the immediate prior therapy will be considered as evidence of clinical benefit from the selected therapy. The secondary endpoints are best response to the molecularly-selected therapy overall survival (OS) and genetic mutation evaluation in metastatic (or locally recurrent) TNBC. The study is designed to demonstrate that the collection and analysis of these tumor samples is feasible.    ,NCT01111175

Breast Cancer,China CellSearch Study, The study is designed to confirm the current indication (below) of the CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell Kit in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients for use of the kit in China. The CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell Kit is intended for the enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTC) of epithelial origin (CD45- EpCAM+ and cytokeratins 8 18+ and/or 19+) in whole blood. The presence of CTC in the peripheral blood as detected by the CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell Kit is associated with decreased progression free survival and decreased overall survival in patients treated for metastatic breast cancer. This test is to be used as an aid in the monitoring of patients with metastatic breast cancer. Serial testing for CTC should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods for monitoring metastatic breast cancer. Evaluation of CTC at any time during the course of disease allows assessment of patient prognosis and is predictive of progression free survival and overall survival.    ,NCT01116869

Breast Cancer,Carboplatin With or Without ZD4054 in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer," In this ""randomised Phase II trial"" all patients will receive carboplatin with half randomly selected to receive ZD4054. The other half to also receive a dummy pill or placebo this is so that we can accurately assess how much extra benefit ZD4054 may give. The trial will recruit 132 patients with metastatic breast cancer from across the UK and assess whether adding ZD4054 to carboplatin delays progression of their disease. It will also show whether the side effects of adding ZD4054 to carboplatin chemotherapy are acceptable. Because ZD4054 has not previously been given with carboplatin to this population in Stage 1 of the study 6 patients will receive ZD4054 with carboplatin. If there are no untoward side effects with carboplatin and ZD4054 then the trial will proceed to Stage 2 and a further 126 patients will be randomised to receive carboplatin with either ZD4054 or the placebo; neither the patient nor their doctor will know whether she is receiving ZD4054 or placebo.

Breast Cancer,Fulvestrant (F)/Goserelin (G) vs Anastrozole (A)/G vs G for Premenopausal Women, Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist with no agonist effects which binds blocks and degrades the ER. Fulvestrant is comparable to third-generation aromatase inhibitors in terms of efficacy and tolerability for patients who have progressed on prior tamoxifen therapy and past studies have found all three-third-generation AIs to be at least as good as tamoxifen in first-line metastatic therapy in postmenopausal women. Fulvestrant has been studied little in premenopausal women despite of its attractive mechanism of actions. The clinical effectiveness of fulvestrant as a treatment for advanced breast cancer has previously been demonstrated at the standard dose (AD; 250 mg/mo) in several phase III clinical trials in postmenopausal women. However there is evidence to suggest that doses of fulvestrant higher than 250 mg may have greater pharmacodynamic activity against the ER pathway. Moreover dose-dependent clinical activity has been observed for fulvestrant. The activity of a fulvestrant high-dose (HD; 500 mg/mo) regimen has been investigated in two recent studies. A pilot Japanese study showed fulvestrant HD to have clinical activity in the treatment of advanced or recurrent breast cancer to be well tolerated and to result in plasma levels approximately double those seen with fulvestrant low-dose. Subsequently a neoadjuvant study comparing fulvestrant low-dose and high-dose reported that significantly greater Ki67 and ER downregulation was achieved with the high-dose compared with the low-dose regimen and that both doses were well tolerated. A recent randomized trial also showed superior outcome of high-dose fulvestrant than AI. Based on this rationale we introduced high-dose fulvestrant with LHRH agonist as a randomized trial comparing with AI plus LHRH agonist and LHRH alone in premenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients who failed to tamoxifen treatment.    ,NCT01266213

Breast Cancer,High Throughput Technologies to Drive Breast Cancer Patients to Specific Phase I/II Trials of Targeted Agents," High sensitivity to targeted agents has been observed in patients whose tumor cells present a genetic/genomic deregulation of the target (Kit mutation ERBB2 amplification EGFR mutations) together with addiction to the given target. More recently activation of ""alternative pathways"" (Kras mutation PI3K mutations) have been reported as a common resistance mechanism to single agent tyrosine kinase inhibitors (trastuzumab cetuximab). From these data has emerged the hypothesis that identification of the deregulated pathway through new molecular tools could allow to propose a more tailored targeted regimen. Based on these concepts numbers of phase I/II trials enrich their populations in patients presenting specific molecular alterations. High throughput technologies (array CGH sequencing gene expression array) identify deregulated genes. In addition these technologies determine whether such genomic alterations are single (expected efficacy of single agent) or multiple (rationale for combination). In a pilot study that included 135 patients we recently performed a combination of array CGH and hot spot mutation array in order to drive patients into phase I/II clinical trials. This study led to the conclusions that high throughput technologies i. are feasible (80%) and robust ii. identify ""targetable"" genomic alterations in around 40% of samples. In the present study the investigators will perform high throughput technologies to drive 400 metastatic breast cancer patients into specific phase I/II trials.    ",NCT01414933

It is indicated in metastatic breast cancer after failure of anthracyclines. However most patients receive anthracyclines as well as taxanes as part of their (neo-)adjuvant therapy. There is currently no standard treatment for patients with an early relapse (<12 months) after a taxane containing (neo-)adjuvant therapy. Nab-paclitaxel a novel nano-particle encapsulated paclitaxel is expected to have only limited cross-resistant to solvent-based taxanes and might therefore be indicated in this setting.    ,NCT01416558
Breast Cancer,Weekly Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab in Metastatic Breast Cancer, The 3 weekly combination of trastuzumab and paclitaxel has been approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer based on a large pivotal study. However mono and combination chemotherapy trials suggest that weekly paclitaxel has a better therapeutic index especially in the palliative setting. The present trial examines the efficacy and safety of weekly paclitaxel over a limited duration combined with continued trastuzumab in HER2+ patients.    ,NCT01423695
Breast Cancer,Epirubicin and Paclitaxel Alone or Together With Capecitabine as First Line Treatment in Metastatic Breast Cancer, Anthracycline-taxane regimens are effective means of postponing progression in metastatic breast cancer. It is yet unclear whether addition of capecitabine to this combination improves the treatment outcome. Patients with advanced breast cancer are randomized to first-line chemotherapy with a combination of epirubicin (Farmorubicin®) and paclitaxel (Taxol®) alone (ET) or in combination with capecitabine (Xeloda® TEX). Starting doses for ET are epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and for TEX epirubicin 75mg/m2 paclitaxel 155 mg/m2 and capecitabine 825 mg/m2 BID for 14 days. Subsequently doses are tailored related to side effects. Primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS) time to treatment failure (TTF) objective response (OR) safety and quality of life (QoL).    ,NCT01433614
Breast Cancer,Study of Cipterbin® Used Alone or With Vinorelbine in Patients With HER2/Neu-overexpressed Metastatic Breast Cancer, The HER2 gene (also known as HER2/neu and ErbB2 gene) is overexpressed in 20-30% of human breast cancers and leads to a particularly aggressive form of the disease. Trastuzumaba humanized anti-HER2/neu receptor monoclonal antibody has been proved a valuable treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer patients.The combination of trastuzumab with chemotherapy has been shown to increase both survival and response rate in comparison to trastuzumab alone. CMAB302 a biosimilar of trastuzumab was developed by Shanghai CP Guojian Pharmaceutical Co.Ltd. Efficacy and safety of CMAB302 as a single agent or in combination with vinorelbine were evaluated in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT01439191

Breast Cancer,Modulation of Response to Hormonal Therapy With Lapatinib and/or Metformin in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer," Target Population: female patients with HER2-negative ER and/or PgR positive breast cancer in progression after first-line hormonal therapy. The study rationale is based on the potentiality of reversing endocrine-resistance by Lapatinib   -  Activity on compensatory-adaptive mechanisms of hyperactivity of signals generated by HER2 family   -  Modulation of energy balance and signals associated to survival through AMPK activation (via Calmodulin) Metformin   -  Indirect mechanism through reduced insulin receptors and IGFR stimulation with reduces proliferative effects downstream   -  Direct mechanism through AMPK activation (via LKB1) with reduced protein synthesis (mTOR inhibition) and increased availability of intracellular energy Lapatinib and Metformin   -  AMPK ""Double""activation through different potentially additional mechanisms.   -  Inhibition of proliferative mechanisms for interference on various intracellular target   -  IR (A e/o B); IGFR   -  EGFR; HER2 Primary objectives : 1. To assess the rate of patients free from disease progression at 3 months from randomization Secondary objectives :   1. To assess the overall response rate   2. To assess the duration of response   3. To assess 3-years overall survival rate   4. To assess tolerability of each proposed treatment Female patients with HER2-negative ER and/or PgR positive breast cancer in progression after first-line hormonal therapy will randomized to receive: hormonal therapy + lapatinib or hormonal therapy + metformin or hormonal therapy + metformin + lapatinib with a ratio 1:1:1. For each arm of the study the following sample size is required:   -  First step: 23 patients for a total of 69 patients in all 3 arms   -  Second step: further 33 patients for a total of 168 patients in all 3 arms.

Breast Cancer,Pazopanib in Combination With Capecitabine in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, Angiogenesis is essential for the growth of large tumor. A number of anti-angiogenic agents are currently under development. Bevacizumab a humanised monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to improve disease free survival in first line metastatic breast cancer when associated with chemotherapy 1. Results of a randomised phase II trial combining sorafenib a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting multiple tyrosine kinases including VEGFR1 VEGFR2 VEGFR3 with capecitabine have recently been reported 2. Compared to capecitabine plus placebo progression-free survival in the capecitabine + sorafenib arm was significantly increased from 4.1 months to 6.4 months. Toxicities were also increased with an incidence rate of grade 3/4 hand foot syndrome of 45% in the capecitabine + sorafenib arm compared to 13% in the capecitabine + placebo arm. The increased toxicity will most likely limit the clinical use of this regimen. Pazopanib is a potent multi-targeted TKI of VEGFR-1 -2 -3 PDGFR-α and -β and c-kit and has recently been approved for the treatment of renal cell cancer in the U.S. In the EU a positive opinion has been issued by the European Medicines Agency. A phase II study of GW786034 (pazopanib) in patients with recurrent or metastatic invasive breast carcinoma included 19 patients after a maximum of 2 lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease 3. Pazopanib 800 mg daily was given continuously. A clinically significant rate of stable disease (58%) was detected with a median TTP of 5.3 months (95% CI: 1.8 - 9.0 months). Four patients treated with pazopanib had SD for ??6 months for a clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as rate of SD for ??6 months or CR or PR of 5/19 (26%) which is at least comparable to sunitinib and bevacizumab (CBR 16% and 17% respectively). The pivotal study of full dose (800 mg) daily pazopanib in renal cell cancer reported hand foot syndrome of all grades in only 6% of patients 4. The optimally tolerated regimen (OTR) of pazopanib was determined when administered in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced CRC 5. In patients who received capecitabine (850 mg twice daily) plus 800 mg once daily pazopanib combined with oxaliplatin the incidence of hand foot syndrome of all grades was 24%. The present study will investigate the combination of pazopanib and capecitabine in advanced or metastatic breast cancer with the aim to develop a new treatment option with increased efficacy and tolerability.    ,NCT01498458

Breast Cancer,Efficacy and Tolerability of Eribulin Plus Lapatinib in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer (E-VITA), -  Lapatinib in combination with capecitabine has been approved for the treatment of women with HER-2-positive advanced breast cancer that have progressed after anthracycline- taxane- and trastuzumab-containing therapies. The use of this combination is limited by overlapping toxicity such as diarrhea and cutaneous side effects.   -  A significant number of patients receive today capecitabine with trastuzumab as first- or second-line treatment. Therefore other combinations of lapatinib with less toxic cytotoxic agents are needed.   -  Eribulin mesylate (E7389) is a synthetic analog of Halichondrin B (HalB) a large polyether macrolide isolated from a marine sponge. Eribulin is a mechanistically unique antagonist of microtubule dynamics among tubulin-targeted agents leading to inhibition of microtubule growth in the absence of effects on microtubule shortening and formation of non- productive tubulin aggregates.   -  Eribulin mesylate at a dose of 1.4 mg/m² given on day 1 8 every 3 weeks has shown better overall survival by 2.5 months compared to treatment of physicians choice in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who were previously treated for 2-5 lines with anthracyclines taxanes and capecitabine (EMBRACE study).   -  The most frequently reported eribulin-related AEs were asthenia/fatigue (65%) alopecia (60%) neutropenia (60%) nausea (44%) anemia (28%) pyrexia (23%) leucopenia (22%) anorexia (21%) constipation (19%) vomiting (18%) and peripheral neuropathy (5.5%; only grade 3). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 32% of patients and febrile neutropenia occurred in 5.5% of patients. The frequency of all other grade 3/4 AEs was less than 3%. This toxicity profile does not overlap with that of lapatinib.   -  There is uncertainty in how far a once every 3 week schedule of eribulin mesylate at a dose of 2.0 mg/m² would be better tolerated. Several phase II studies are currently conducted in various non-breast cancer indications to compare the d1+8 q d21 with a d1 q d21 schedule.   -  The aim of this randomized phase II study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two dose-schedules of eribulin plus lapatinib in HER2-positive breast cancer pre-treated with trastuzumab in the adjuvant and/or metastatic setting.    ,NCT01534455

Breast Cancer,Effect of a Goal Setting Intervention on Exercise in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer: An Exploration of The Lipogenic Pathway, This study is a randomized prospective clinical trial of women with metastatic breast cancer. The purpose of the study is to test if an intervention of regular physical activity review and physical activity goal setting will allow the subjects to achieve a moderate increase in physical activity of 6000 steps per week. The physical activity review will consist of weekly telephone call to inquire about symptoms and to set physical activity goals. The study will also look to see if the goal setting intervention will affect the time to progression change in BMI and quality of life. Quality of life will be measured by answers to questionnaires provided to subjects at regular intervals during the course of the study. Finally the study will examine the impact of physical activity on expression of tumor molecular molecules insulin levels and estradiol levels. Through an intervention of regular physical activity review and goal setting the investigators hypothesize that a moderate increase in level of physical activity of 6000 steps per week or more can be obtained by patients with metastatic breast cancer who receive a goal setting intervention. The investigators propose that those who are able to achieve and maintain greater than or equal to 22500 steps per week will demonstrate biologic and molecular differences compared to those who are not able to achieve that level of physical activity. The investigators expect that people who are more active will have longer to progression.    ,NCT01653366

Breast Cancer,Study of Fulvestrant +/- Everolimus in Post-Menopausal Hormone-Receptor + Metastatic Breast Ca Resistant to AI," Post-menopausal women with hormone-receptor positive (HR+) metastatic breast cancer resistant to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy will be randomized to receive Fulvestrant (Faslodex) with Everolimus or Fulvestrant (Faslodex) with a placebo (no active ingredients). Fulvestrant has demonstrated activity when used as first second or third line endocrine therapy making it an attractive therapy for combination with other agents. In addition it is commonly reserved for use following disease progression on AI therapy. Everolimus is an orally administered drug that blocks a signaling pathway called ""mTOR"". ""mTOR"" acts as a regulator for many processes in the body including cell growth. Blocking this pathway may have an effect on cell growth. The combination of a novel class of agents (mTOR inhibitors) and an established standard treatment for metastatic HR+ breast cancer may potentially increase the clinical benefit by targeting multiple different biological pathways.

Breast Cancer,Clinical Value of 89Zr-trastuzumab PET, Information about the presence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in tumor lesions in breast cancer patients is essential for diagnostic and therapeutic management of metastatic breast cancer. In daily practice however obtaining a metastasis biopsy can be difficult or impracticable. Therefore clinicians can be faced with a persistent clinical dilemma in some breast cancer patients leading to suboptimal therapy decisions due to lack of HER2 receptor information. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) which may provide additional information have so far not been able to replace the biopsy. To solve this problem non-invasive whole body visualization and quantification of HER2 expression by means of the HER2-PET may be a valuable tool. In this prospective multicenter imaging study eligible patients will receive one HER2-PET and CTC analysis in addition to standard work up for metastatic disease. Subsequent administration of anti-HER2 therapy will be evaluated. Referring physicians fill in three questionnaires one before HER2-PET and two after HER2-PET.    ,NCT01832051
Breast Cancer,Trastuzumab & Pertuzumab Followed by T-DM1 in MBC, In HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer trastuzumab based treatment is the standard of care as long as there are no contraindications to trastuzumab. Frequently trastuzumab is being combined with taxanes in the first-line setting. However since therapy with trastuzumab is active even in the absence of chemotherapy in HER2-positive MBC the optimal treatment strategy either in combination or in sequence with chemotherapy is still under debate. This randomized phase II trial is studying a new strategy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with HER2-positive. First-line treatment consists of trastuzumab and pertuzumab a treatment without chemotherapy. In case of disease progression chemotherapy with T-DM1 is then performed as second-line treatment. Third-line and further line therapies are performed according to the physician's discretion. If this new therapeutic strategy is as effective and better tolerated than the conventional strategy this would mean a serious breakthrough in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT01835236

Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer Molecular Analysis Protocol," This is a molecular testing study for patients with metastatic breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to find defects in the DNA of the cancer that could potentially be treated with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved or investigational drugs. For example if your cancer has a mutation in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene (a mutation is a change int he DNA sequence of a gene) that makes this receptor ""superactive"" a drug that inhibits this receptor may also inhibit the growth of the cancer. If this genetic defect is not present in the cancer the same drug may not work. This EGFR gene mutation based patient selection for treatment has worked in lung cancer and we are testing its value in breast cancer. What drugs may be available against particular genetic abnormalities in the context of this clinical study will change over time.    ",NCT01855503

Breast Cancer,IMaging PAtients for Cancer Drug selecTion - Metastatic Breast Cancer, Current patient work-up including conventional imaging and pathological assessment of just one single biopsy might be insufficient to identify metastatic breast cancer patients who possibly benefit from first-line anti-hormonal or anti-HER2 therapy. As receptor conversion of the tumor is found quite frequently and molecular heterogeneity can occur within one patient up-to-date whole body information is necessary to determine estrogen receptor (ER) and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor status and subsequently guide therapy decision. With molecular imaging via PET this information can be obtained in a non-invasive patient friendly way. Furthermore to improve and individualize treatment and be able to identify (new) drug targets and biomarkers sampling of venous blood circulating tumor cells (CTC) as well as circulating tumor DNA microRNA (miRNA) and molecular characterization of one metastasis at the beginning and if feasible of an additional biopsy during therapy is necessary.    ,NCT01957332

Breast Cancer,AR and ER Imaging in Metastatic Breast Cancer, Knowledge of breast cancer estrogen receptor (ER) expression is of major importance in treatment-decision making. Patients with ER-positive tumors can be treated with anti-oestrogen therapy which has relatively few side effects compared to chemotherapy. Whole-body tumor ER-expression can be visualized by 18F-fluoroestradiol PET imaging (FES-PET). In addition to ER the androgen receptor (AR) is a potential new target in breast cancer. PET imaging with 18F-fluorodihydrotestosterone (18F-FDHT) may allow visualization of tumor AR-expression. In the current study we will perform FES-PET and FDHT-PET in metastatic breast cancer patients and evaluate the concordance with concurrent biopsies. Molecular imaging of tumor AR- and ER-expression may well be of value for future treatment decision-making.    ,NCT01988324

Breast Cancer,Orteronel as Monotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) That Expresses the Androgen Receptor (AR), The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in 70-90 percent of primary breast tumors and in 75 percent of breast metastases. There is evidence to suggest that Androgen Receptor (AR) may be a target in patients with advanced breast cancer. Breast cancer patients whose tumors do not express the ER PR or HER2 (triple negative) have very few options for treatment. Orteronel is being developed as an endocrine therapy for relevant hormone-sensitive cancers such as prostrate cancer and breast cancer. Triple-negative metastatic breast cancer patients with AR expression could potentially benefit from anti-androgen therapy like orteronel.    ,NCT01990209

Breast Cancer,Phase II Study Using Genomic & Proteomic Profiling to Influence Treatments for Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer," Genes are the basic ""instruction book"" for the cells that make up our bodies and are made out of DNA. Many research studies are done to find the best possible way to treat patients with cancer. Recently there has been a great deal of interest in developing new anticancer agents that are more targeted to a patient's individual genetic information as well as diseases caused by defects in a person's genes. Identification of precisely which treatments to use against a specific patient's tumor is challenging. In this study four cutting-edge technologies will be used to identify genomic (information we get from DNA and RNA) and proteomic (information we get from proteins) targets for the treatment of your tumor. These four tests will be used together to gather information about your tumor giving doctors and scientists a better understanding of the structure of your tumor and what the best treatment or combination of treatments may be for you. The therapy you receive to treat your tumor will be based on your medical history previous treatments for your disease if applicable current state of health and the findings from these four tests. The therapy you ultimately receive will be selected by your doctor in consultation with a panel of experts in cancer and cancer genomics (the Treatment Selection Committee).    ",NCT02008994

Breast Cancer,AURORA: Aiming to Understand the Molecular Aberrations in Metastatic Breast Cancer.," This program initially aims to recruit 1300 breast cancer patients from a large number of hospitals across Europe. Eligible patients are those who are 18 or older either female or male and who have not received more than 1 type of treatment from the time metastases were discovered metastasi(e)s has just been diagnosed or their disease has come back (disease relapse). Biopsy samples from both the primary and metastatic (or relapsed) tumor will be collected for central analyses together with blood serum and plasma samples. Any samples not analyzed immediately will be stored in an independent bio-repository to enable future (not yet defined) research aimed at better understanding metastatic breast cancer. In summary the main objectives of AURORA are to better understand the genetic aberrations in metastatic breast cancer and to discover the mechanisms of response or resistance to therapy in order to ultimately identify the ""right therapy for each individual patient"". At the same time patients with genetic aberrations that are being targeted by new drugs in development will be offered the possibility to participate in clinical trials when approved and available in their countries.

Breast Cancer,Rapid Medical Donation Programme for Breast Cancer, Treatment of breast cancer has traditionally been based on the primary tumour's features in the breast. Only recently when cancer returns at other sites has there been an attempt to biopsy the metastatic disease and change treatments accordingly. A 'repeat biopsy' can be technically difficult painful and when possible only represents a small sample of one of many metastases. Even when one deposit responds to a new treatment a neighbouring one may continue to grow. There is an urgent need to characterise all deposits particularly the lethal ones which progress despite all treatments. This study will enable the comprehensive analysis of the metastatic process and the evolution of the breast cancer through the course of its treatment. Patients who have consented during life to donate their tissues for molecular analysis will provide the means for such an analysis. Main aims:   -  To comprehensively and systematically examine metastatic breast cancer by its detailed exploratory molecular characterization to elucidate the possible inter- and intratumoural heterogeneity between the primary tumour and the majority of metastatic sites.   -  To map the natural history of the metastatic breast cancer process    ,NCT02126800
Breast Cancer,Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody in Advanced Trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive Breast Cancer," A significant amount of preclinical and correlative clinical data suggest that HER2-positive breast cancer could be amenable to immune¬therapeutic approaches. The presence of HER2-overexpression in breast cancers is associated with higher levels of proliferation high histologic grade and higher levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) compared with HER2-negative tumors. The investigators therefore hypothesize that for HER2-positive tumors avoidance of destruction by the host immune system must be an important mechanism contributing to tumor growth and progression. The term ""immune evasion"" refers to the ability of the tumor to suppress and change host anti-tumor immune reactions. The programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway represents a major immune control switch which may be engaged by tumor cells to overcome active T-cell immune surveillance. The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in various tumors. High expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (and to a lesser extent of PD-L2) has been found to correlate with poor prognosis and survival in various other solid tumor types. Furthermore PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-cell expansion in patients with malignant melanoma. These observations suggest that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in the tumor immune evasion and could be considered an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in several solid organ types. MK-3475 (previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly-selective humanized mAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. MK-3475 strongly enhances T lymphocyte immune responses in cultured blood cells from healthy human donors cancer patients and primatesMK-3475 also modulates the level of interleukin-2 (IL-2) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) interferon gamma (IFNγ) and other cytokines. The investigators therefore propose to evaluate if the addition of an immunotherapy can reverse trastuzumab resistance and improve clinical outcomes in HER2-positive disease. In this study the investigators will determine if a monoclonal antibody targeted against PD-1 a T cell negative regulator can reverse trastuzumab resistance in patients previously progressing on trastuzumab.

The study will enroll patients with HER2-positive unresectable locally advanced breast cancer (BC) if they have recurrent disease or progressive disease (PD) despite primary multi-modality therapy and/or metastatic BC if they have not received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. Eligible participants at up to approximately 40 sites in the Asia-Pacific region will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab emtansine (Arm A) or trastuzumab plus docetaxel (Arm B). All study drugs will be administered at in-clinic visits occurring every three weeks during the treatment phase.

Breast Cancer,Safety and Efficacy Study of Eribulin in Combination With Bevacizumab for Second-line Treatment HER2- MBC Patients, In the second-line treatment setting for MBC many agents including antitubulin drugs (Taxanes Vinorelbine) and antimetabolites (Capecitabine Gemcitabine) have demonstrated activity but no agent is clearly superior. Although some combinations of cytotoxic agents provide a small progression-free survival advantage none has demonstrated an OS advantage and toxicity is generally greater than for single agents. At present there is no standard for this treatment setting. New treatments that could delay disease progression without systemic toxicity would represent a significant advancement.    ,NCT02175446
Breast Cancer,ER Reactivation Therapy for Breast Cancer, Before anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen were developed to treat estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer high-dose estrogen therapies were used. This seems counterintuitive since anti-estrogens block ER function while estrogens increase ER function but these therapies are effective to similar extents for the treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer. Estrogen therapies are most effective against cancers that develop resistance to anti-estrogens likely because such cancers have adapted to grow without ER function and restoring ER function (with estrogen) is damaging to the cancer cells. In some patients with ER+ breast cancer that becomes resistant to anti-estrogens treatment with the estrogen 17b-estradiol induces tumor response. Furthermore when 17b-estradiol-sensitive tumors eventually become resistant to 17b-estradiol switching back to anti-estrogen therapy is often effective. These observations suggest that cancers can alternate between anti-estrogen-sensitive and 17b-estradiol-sensitive states. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with alternating 17b-estradiol / anti-estrogen therapies on a defined 8-week / 16-week schedule will more effectively prevent cancer growth than continuous treatment with either type of therapy in patients with metastatic anti-estrogen-resistant ER+ breast cancer.    ,NCT02188745

Breast Cancer,Eribulin Plus Gemcitabine (EG) vs Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine (PG) in HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer, Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable disease and is needed to improve effective chemotherapy. Paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine (PG) combination chemotherapy is one of the preferred chemotherapeutic regimens for patients with MBC and was found to be proper as a maintenance chemotherapy regimen with survival benefit and feasible toxicity profile as shown in a large phase III KCSG (Korean Cancer Study Group) study (Park Y et al. J Clin Oncol 31(14):1732 2013). Eribulin mesylate is a microtubule-targeting agent that showed improved overall survival benefit as monotherapy for MBC patients as a new chemotherapeutic agent after failure of anthracycline and taxane in EMBRACE study (Cortes J et. al. Lancet 377:914-923 2011). Eribulin was also reported its promising efficacy in another randomized phase III study that demonstrated eribulin as efficacious as capecitabine (Kaufman P et. al. Abstr# S6-6 SABCS 2012). Both study results showed potential clinical benefit in patients with triple negative MBC (TNBC). Thus eribulin combined with gemcitabine may be a new potential regimen for early line therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Furthermore eribulin may have rational benefit compared with paclitaxel in terms of neurotoxicity. Although there is no direct evidence that eribulin has better neurotoxicity profile than taxane eribulin tended to show less neurotoxicity compared with ixabepilone in a phase II trial (Vahdat L et al. 2011 SABCS). Eribulin has no worsen toxicity as compared to paclitaxel. Therefore EG may have less neurotoxicity comparing to PG. In phase I trial eribulin in combination with gemcitabine was feasible in patients with advanced solid tumor treated with chemotherapy (< 3 lines) (Goel R et al 2009 ASCO). Based on this rationale the investigators are to conduct randomized phase II study comparing EG chemotherapy with PG chemotherapy for patients with HER-2 negative MBC as first-line chemotherapy. A total of 112 patients will be recruited. Patients will be randomized to a treatment arm by permutated method. The randomization ratio is 1:1. This study is multi-center randomized open label study.    ,NCT02263495
Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Medical Treatments in MBC Patients According Biological Subtype and Line of Treatments," Breast cancer is the most common cancer in many countries: in Italy about 48.000 new breast cancers are diagnosed every year and despite improvements in diagnosis and therapy about 13.000 women die every year for this disease . About 6-7% of breast cancer patients are metastatic at diagnosis  while the majority of patients with stage IV has a previous history of breast cancer that has already been treated. According to various prognostic factors (tumor size lymph nodes involvement grading hormone receptors status HER-2 status) in the worst-case scenario more than 30% of node-negative breast cancer patients and more than 70% of node-positive patients relapse2. The evolution of metastatic breast cancer has changed considerably in the last years with the approval of new drugs. In fact already in 2003 Giordano et al showed that the prognosis of metastatic breast cancer patients was improved significantly from 1970's to 2000 with a median survival of 15 months in the early 1970's compared with 60 months in the last 1990's. This significant survival gain was obtained with introduction of new drugs as hormonal chemotherapeutic and biological agents. The greater availability of drugs has led to an increase in number of lines of treatment receiving by metastatic breast cancer patients. However there are few published data on actual duration of metastatic breast cancer treatments. Moreover there is no evidence to support a real impact on survival of treatments beyond the second-third line. Recently a retrospective analysis of about 199 metastatic breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy showed that tumor subtype is associated with the duration and number of lines of chemotherapy (for example HER positive versus ""triple-negative"" patients) .

Breast Cancer,Praegnant Breast Cancer, Among patients with breast cancer the subgroup of patients with metastases are considered the group of patients with the worst prognosis. Not only with regard to therapy decisions but also with regard to quality assured healthcare and health economics this entity of patients remains a challenge. Recently novel advances in breast cancer therapy aim at the targeted therapy of tumor entities and identification of patients for whom the greatest therapy benefit and the least side effects are expected. However molecular assessment of the patient and the tumor in the metastatic situation is not performed on a routine basis and in many cases tumor characteristics from the primary tumor are considered reliable enough to make therapy decisions for the metastatic patients. Although molecular reassessment of tumor characteristics from tumor material of the metastasis is recommended in national guidelines only a minority of patients is biopsied because of the invasiveness of the procedure even though biopsy related complications are reported to be rare. With modern analytic methods from blood based biomaterial there seems to be an opportunity to correlate blood based tumor assessments with actual characteristics of the tumor. These include expression analysis tumor mutation analysis tumor gene copy number abberations and others. One of the main aims of the PRAEGNANT study is therefore to establish an infrastructure for the comprehensive analysis of tumor and metastatic molecular characteristics of the patient and the tumor. Furthermore the impact of health care related outcomes such as health economics novel approaches for integration of patients in study conduct and health care awareness are study aims of the PRAEGNANT study.    ,NCT02338167

Breast Cancer,Observation of Medical Treatments in MBC HER2-negative Patients, While therapeutic strategies for HER2-positive breast cancer are well defined there is not a standard strategy for HER2-negative tumors. Because of lack of information related to the the factors affecting the choice of a particular treatment strategy as well as the optimization of the correct sequence of treatments the choice of the treatment for the advanced disease remains highly empirical and may differ significantly among the different cancer centers. The purpose of this study is the observation of a cohort of patients with metastatic HER2-negative in terms of:   1. the choice of chemotherapy treatments starting from the first line of treatment;   2. factors that may influence these choices;   3. correlation among the characteristics of patients (age menopausal status etc.) and type of adjuvant and metastatic treatment ;   4. clinical outcome (pattern of relapse time from diagnosis etc.);   5. evaluation of the adherence to the literature's recommendations for therapeutic sequences in clinical practice.    ,NCT02365831
Breast Cancer,A Double-blind Study of Paclitaxel in Combination With Reparixin or Placebo for Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer, Reparixin oral tablets are being tested as a CSC targeting agent in patients with metastatic non- human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-amplified BC. An open label Phase 1b clinical study (REP0111) is ongoing (enrollment completed) in five US sites under IND # 112502 to test safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and detect early signs of antitumor activity of increasing doses of reparixin oral tablets in combination with a fixed dose of weekly paclitaxel. The study has demonstrated safety and tolerability of the combination across the three dose levels explored and recorded objective responses in the published range for single agent weekly paclitaxel in the target population. The highest dose level explored (i.e. 1200 mg t.i.d.) was identified as the recommended phase 2 dose. Durable responses have been recorded in patients with TNBC. The current phase 2 study thus aims to evaluate the Progression Free Survival of patients with metastatic TNBC [relapsed following (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy] receiving reparixin in combination with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone.    ,NCT02370238
Breast Cancer,Fulvestrant as Maintenance Therapy After First-line Chemotherapy in HER2 - Postmenopausal MBC Patients, Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women and represents 20 - 25% of all female cancers. Despite earlier diagnosis and improvement in adjuvant therapies some patients will present metastatic recurrence. Treatment of breast cancer is determined by the extent of the disease. Early or localized breast cancer is treated by a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. Adjuvant systemic therapy consisting of chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy in tumors deemed hormone responsive can prolong the disease-free interval and improve overall survival. However approximately 30% to 40% of patients with early breast cancer will ultimately relapse with either local recurrence or distant metastases and require further systemic treatment for advanced disease. Since breast cancer that recurs or progresses after initial treatment is considered incurable the therapy options available for advanced disease are concerned with disease control and palliation of symptoms. Hormonal therapy has become the treatment of choice in postmenopausal women with hormone sensitive breast cancer. Even though the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women has improved with the introduction of agents such as aromatase inhibitors these agents still have limitations and disease management continues to be sub-optimal. The use of systemic therapies such as hormonal therapy chemotherapy or new biological treatment is to reduce tumour masses improve survival and preserve quality of life. Whatever the initial efficacy of the treatment undertaken in metastatic setting almost every patient will relapse. The main goal is to improve progression free survival (PFS). To achieve this the type of chemotherapy the optimal duration of chemotherapy the benefit of maintenance chemotherapy the benefit of maintenance hormonal treatment are debatable.    ,NCT02383030

Breast Cancer,Phase Ib Dose-escalation Trial of Taselisib (GDC-0032) in Combination With Anti-HER2 Therapies in Participants With Advanced HER2+ Breast Cancer, This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about the combination of Taselisib with other drugs in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Taselisib is an investigational drug which works by blocking a protein called PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) that helps cancer cells grow. This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from these studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells. The main purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of Taselisib to be used with other drugs in further clinical studies. This is an open-label 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib study to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD) and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Taselisib. This study will be conducted in 4 separate arms. (A-D).    ,NCT02390427
Breast Cancer,A Pilot Dose Escalation Trial of a Densified Chemotherapy Association of Docetaxel and Epirubicin Driven by Mathematical Modeling in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients: The MODEL1 Study, To determine the maximum tolerated dose of a densified regimen of the association of docetaxel (DTX) and epirubicin (EPI) supported by the concomitant administration of hematopoietic growth factors in patients with metastatic breast cancer in first-line optimizing in each patient the administration schedule using a formal procedure based on mathematical models in order to manage the severity of induced neutropenia. The models used in this project allow:   -  an optimal administration schedule of the planned total dose per cycle (number of infusions and calculating their rates and durations)   -  an individualization of the administration schedule from the second cycle (based on observations from the first cycle) and   -  an assessment of the risk of a dose-limiting toxicity event combining several severe non-hematological toxicities (conditioning the decision for dose escalation). Using formal mathematical models the investigators expect controlling the hematological and non-hematological toxicities in order to realize the full series of six cycles of densified DTX+EPI chemotherapy (2 weeks per cycle) for each patient. For each patient chemotherapy is considered feasible if it is possible in the absence of tumor progression to consider 6 cycles of treatment without observing any serious adverse events and without:   -  patient death that may be related to the treatments;   -  decision of the patient to interrupt treatment for physical or psychological tolerance reasons;   -  decision of the investigator to discontinue treatment in the absence of disease progression.    ,NCT02392845

Breast Cancer,Prospective Evaluation Of High-Dose Systemic Methotrexate In Patients With Breast Cancer And Leptomeningeal Metastasis, Management of leptomeningeal disease (LMD) in patients with metastatic breast cancer is an area of unmet clinical need. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is known to have activity against breast cancer and in contrast to other systemic chemotherapeutics it penetrates the blood brain barrier targets areas of poor cerebrospinal fluid flow may penetrate bulky leptomeningeal disease and provide treatment to systemic disease burden. While two retrospective studies have suggested activity of HD-MTX in LMD in patients with breast cancer no prospective data are available to inform its inclusion in treatment regimens. Thus while HD-MTX is included in the NCCN Guidelines for LMD and while it is used to varying degrees in cancer centers across the nation this is more representative of the lack of available therapies for LMD as opposed to strong evidence-based data. This phase II prospective study will evaluate systemic intravenous HD-MTX in breast cancer patients with leptomeningeal metastasis with or without brain parenchymal metastasis.    ,NCT02422641
Breast Cancer,PAKT: AZD5363 in Combination With Paclitaxel in Triple-Negative Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer, Normally cells in human body divide in an orderly way. However in cancer cells some important proteins which help control cell growth start to behave abnormally resulting in faster growth and multiplication. In this study we are looking at a protein called AKT that helps the cancer cells to develop. Blocking the action of AKT with a drug like AZD5363 may slow down or stop the cancer growing. The development of AZD5363 is intended to provide a new treatment option for patients with cancer. The standard chemotherapy agent Paclitaxel is given to destroy cancer cells. AZD5363 may also make the cancer more sensitive to Paclitaxel and so make this agent more effective. A gene called PIK3CA has an important relationship with AKT. In tumours where this gene has been altered or said to have 'mutated' the response to AZD5363 may be better. PIK3CA mutations are found commonly in breast cancers and we will test for the presence of these mutations in both blood and tumour tissue samples that we ask you to provide. This study will also look at the relationship between tumours with PIK3CA mutations and the effect of the treatment.    ,NCT02423603

Breast Cancer,SOLTI Breast Cancer Molecular Screening Program (AGATA), In recent years the advance in high-throughput techniques such as microarrays and next gen sequencing (NGS) technologies have allowed a more precise classification of the breast cancer molecular subtypes and a more personalized approach to anti-cancer therapy. To date conventional methods to select patients for clinical trials with anti-targeted agents according to molecular criteria are generally limited to the analysis of a few biomarkers. Recent studies have shown how this strategy is inappropriate in case of infrequent molecular alterations and that the ideal strategy would consist in simultaneous examination of large numbers of actionable genomic alterations. This is the first genomic screening platform ever attempted in Spain. By this molecular platform SOLTI aims to increase the likelihood of a patient being included in a trial designed specifically for her molecular tumor type. Thus the primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the Platform's effectiveness to include patients in clinical trials with targeted agents based on the tumor molecular profiling.    ,NCT02445482

Breast Cancer,A Study of Palbociclib With Exemestane Plus GnRH Versus Capecitabine in Premenopausal Women With HR+ MBC, Despite recent advances for the treatment of post-menopausal hormone receptor-positive BC in the last decade there was no major improvement of hormonal therapy specifically for premenopausal metastatic breast cancer. The median age of breast cancer is much younger and the proportion of young breast cancer (YBC) patients (less than 40) including premenopausal women is much higher in Asia including Korea. Capecitabine the comparator in this trial is an orally-administered fluoropyrimidine derivative and has shown high efficacy and low toxicity in metastatic breast cancer patients. Palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy showed marked advance in hormone receptor-positive MBC in the post-menopausal setting. After a median follow-up of 16.5 months preliminary results from Part 1 of this Phase 2 trial suggest that the combination of PD-0332991 with letrozole is superior to letrozole alone and improved objective response and disease control rates (52% vs 32% and 76% vs 47% respectively) in patients treated with the combination. These remarkable results may contribute to have much benefit with endocrine therapy for premenopausal women. Most importantly recent PALOMA-3 trial revealed superior results of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant (median PFS 9.2 vs 3.8 months P<0.001). Based on these rational backgrounds the purpose of this phase II study is to assess the safety and the clinical anti-tumor activity of exemestane plus goserelin acetate in combination with palbociclib vs capecitabine in premenopausal hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer patients    ,NCT02592746

Breast Cancer,Characterization & Comparison of Drugable Mutations in Primary and Metastatic Tumors CTCs and cfDNA in MBCpatients, Characterization of the driver mutations in an individual metastatic breast cancer patient is critical for many reasons. Effective targeted therapies require identifying genomic alterations in the tumoral tissue. The scarce efficacy of many currently available targeted drugs may be due to the outbreak of resistant clones with different genotype that already present at the initiation of therapy. It is well known the intra-tumor heterogeneity with genetic and non-genetic factors considered as the origin of the tumor cell-clon composition. The acquisition of multiple mutations (driver and passenger) altogether with the stage of differentiation according to the cancer stem cell hypothesis confers to the tumor cells clinically important properties such as resistance to therapies and seeding abilities. Moreover there is a current challenge in establishing whether the metastatic cells arise from the most aggressive and dominant clone in the primary tumor or the metastasic tissue diverges with substantial genetic changes very early in the evolution of the disease. Primary and metastatic tumor may have a close clonal relationship or evolve in parallel and acquire different genomic alterations. In the real life it is plausible that both models coexist with different predominance according to the tumoral tissue and etiology. The study hypothesizes that breast cancer metastases and primary tumors could harbor different genomic profiles related to genomic regions of interest in a clinically relevant proportion of metastatic breast cancer patients. Moreover the genomic aberrations found in the metastatic breast cancer tissue could also be detected in CTCs and circulating free DNA. If true CTCs and circulating free DNA would be convenient non-invasive easily accessible sources of genomic material for the analysis of mutations and other genomic aberrations.    ,NCT02626039
Breast Cancer,Study of Efficacy of Ribociclib After Progression on CDK4/6 Inhibition in Patients With HR+ H2N- Advanced Breast Cancer, This is a randomize trial for patients with metastatic HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer who have progressed on an aromatase inhibitor plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor (either palbociclib or ribociclib) to either fulvestrant alone or fulvestrant with ribociclib. The purpose of the trial is to determine whether there is continued benefit for patients to remain on a CDK4/6 inhibitor at the time of switching anti-estrogen therapy. As ribociclib and palbociclib have a similar toxicity and drug profile and mechanism of action we feel that it is appropriate for patients to receive either drug with an aromatase inhibitor prior to randomization.    ,NCT02632045

Breast Cancer,Therapy Management With Nab-Paclitaxel in Daily Routine, Despite treatment improvements in breast cancer a large number of patients still progress to the metastatic stage. Metastatic breast cancer patients have an extremely unfavorable prognosis. Not only efficacy but also quality of life are in the focus when planning a therapy or therapy sequence for metastatic breast cancer patients. Therapy options include anti-hormonal Therapy antibody therapies other targeted therapies and chemotherapies. One of the most effective chemotherapies in the adjuadjuvant and metastatic setting is paclitaxel. However drug handling and its side effects can compromise patients quality of life and can have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of the drug. In metastatic breast cancer patients increasing therapy efficacy and reduction of side effect frequency are considered to be advancements of therapy. One of these advancements is the development of a cremophor free and albumin bound paclitaxel nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane) which is thought to have a better efficacy and reduced toxicity profile. Nab-Paclitaxel is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer after a failure of first-line therapy and when antracyclines are not indicated. The SERAPHINA study aims to investigate in the use of nab-Paclitaxel in daily routine and the frequency and perception of side effects. As a non-interventional study the SERAPHINA Study will assess the patient characteristics and describe the patient cohort in which nab-Paclitaxel is given. This includes age distribution molecular epidemiological characteristics and characteristics documented by the patients themselves.    ,NCT02642406

Breast Cancer,Dose Escalating Study of Foxy-5 in Breast- Colon- or Prostate Cancer Patients, The Wnt proteins belong to a family of proteins that have been demonstrated to play a role in the formation and dissemination of tumours. The present project focuses on the critical role of the Wnt-5a protein in the pathobiological processes that lead to metastatic cancer disease. WntResearch has identified a formylated 6 amino acid peptide fragment named Foxy-5 which mimick the effects of Wnt-5a to impair migration of epithelial cancer cells and thereby acting anti-metastatic. The aim of the first clinical phase I study was to establish the recommended dose for a clinical phase II study and enable further development of Foxy-5 as a first in class anti-metastatic cancer drug. The study did not see any DLTs and therefore failed to reach maximum tolerated dose (MTD); no recommended phase II dose (RP2D) could therefore be established based on toxicity. The aim of this study is to continue to establish the safety profile of Foxy-5 in higher doses and determine the RP2D for later stage development based on any observed DLT's/MTD and further analysis of the pharmacodynamic profile of Foxy-5 to determine the biological response dose (BRD).    ,NCT02655952

Breast Cancer,Physical Activity to Maintain Quality of Life and Physical Function in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer: a Pilot Study, Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable disease. Maintaining optimum quality of life is a major goal of care. There is a strong body of evidence that exercise can reduce or manage fatigue depression and insomnia in breast cancer patients; however the evidence base is overwhelmingly in early stage cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to see if a home-based self-directed walking program can have similar benefits in women with an MBC diagnosis. The primary objective is to evaluate whether engagement in physical activity will reduce fatigue during active treatment for MBC (baseline to 3 months); this is the primary endpoint. Secondary objectives pertain to feasibility of recruitment and retention of study participants and measuring changes between baseline 3 months and 6 months in additional quality of life measures. Exploratory analyses pertain to changes in p16INK4a levels and sarcopenia between baseline and 3 months. The design is a single arm intervention trial in 30 patients. Findings from this study will provide preliminary data for a grant application to test the physical activity intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a large sample of women with metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT02682836

Breast Cancer,PAINTER: Polymorphism And INcidence of Toxicity in ERibulin Treatment, On March 17th 2011 the European Commission issued a marketing authorization valid throughout the European Union for Eribulin mesylate (Halaven; Eisai Limited) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after at least two chemotherapic regimens for advanced disease. As the use of Eribulin will be widespread in this tumor setting a better knowledge of its safety profile outside clinical trials is warranted. Indeed the possibility to select patients at risk for developing Eribulin-induced neuropathy will allow the exclusion from these treatment of those patients harbouring the specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Given that Eribulin toxicity often results in treatment discontinuation the ability to anticipate which patients will experience severe toxicity could allow for either early intervention or even possibly for prophylactic therapy or for selection of the patients to be treated.    ,NCT02864030

Breast Cancer,18F-FLT-PET Imaging of the Brain in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer to the Brain Treated With Whole Brain Radiation Therapy With or Without Sorafenib: Comparison With MR Imaging of the Brain," The purpose of this study is to compare two different imaging methods to examine the response of brain metastases to WBRT. These two imaging methods will take pictures of the brain using : 1) a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner and 2) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. A PET scanner resembles a CT or MR scanner.PET scans use radioactive substances also called as radioactive markers to ""see"" cancer cells. We plan to use [18F]FLT as a radioactive marker. FLT is used to image tumor growth. FLT PET scan is a new clinical procedure. It is in the testing stage of development unlike FDG-PET which is used more commonly used. Therefore this is considered a ""research"" study. This will help us evaluate whether this scan will be safe and better used in the future to evaluate tumors. The amount of radiation to the body is small. The radiation from the radiotracer drug will be gone from the body in a few hours. There is no radiation risk from the MRI scans. Additionally we also plan to use MRI imaging of the brain. We expect that [18F]FLT PET is better when compared to MRI and will give us more information about the brain metastases after WBRT.

Close to two-thirds of women with bone metastases will go on to develop at least one of these complications termed a skeletal related event (SRE) defined as 1) pathological fractures 2) pain requiring radiation or surgical intervention 3)spinal cord compression and 4) hypercalcemia. In addition to SREs most breast cancer patients with bone metastases have some degree of pain associated with their disease. Understandably these factors negatively impact their quality of life. Furthermore the development of an SRE in this population has been shown to be associated with shorter overall survival. Prevention or delay in onset of these complications is therefore an important therapeutic goal.    ,NCT01344967
Breast Cancer,Expanded Access With ABT-888 (Veliparib) to Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer, This is an expanded access protocol to allow continued maintenance therapy with ABT-888 (veliparib) for three patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer who are currently receiving the investigational product in association with clinical trial participation. Additionally the protocol will enroll up to 7 new patients with metastatic BRCA associated or triple negative breast cancer to allow for additional access to veliparib monotherapy or at the investigator's discretion veliparib in combination with cisplatin and/or vinorelbine.    ,NCT02985658
Breast Cancer,Cabazitaxel Plus Lapatinib as Therapy for HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With Intracranial Metastases, This phase II trial will combine two agents cabazitaxel and lapatinib to treat patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which has metastasized to the brain. The first portion of the study will determine the optimal dose of the cabazitaxel/lapatinib combination to administer to patients. After determining the optimal dose patients will continue treatment with cabazitaxel and lapatinib to assess response to treatment with these agents.    ,NCT01934894
Breast Cancer,Schedules of Nab-Paclitaxel in Metastatic Breast Cancer, Longer first line chemotherapy duration has recently been associated with a modest but significant improvement in overall survival and a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer patients. Prolonging chemotherapy until disease progression however must be weighed against the detrimental effects of continuous chemotherapy delivery. The SNAP trial seeks to improve the tolerability of prolonged chemotherapy administration strategy by studying alternative treatment schedules while preserving and possibly improving treatment efficacy in this disease setting. The availability of a new nanoparticle albumin-bound taxane nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane®) represents an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Nab-Paclitaxel has been developed in an attempt to reduce the toxicity associated with standard taxane administration (caused by the use of chemical solvents) while increasing antitumor efficacy. The SNAP randomized phase II trial evaluates three schedules of nab-Paclitaxel as prolonged chemotherapy administration strategy. Each of three arms will be compared to a historical reference of seven-month median progression-free survival (PFS) based on the most recent trial with docetaxel as control arm to determine whether any of the three arms are worthy of further investigation.    ,NCT01746225
Breast Cancer,A Phase II Study Evaluating the Role of Androgen Receptors as Targets for Therapy of Pre-treated Post-menopausal Patients With ER/PgR-negative/AR-positive or ER and/or PgRpositive/ AR-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (ARTT), A phase II non randomized study evaluating the role of Androgen Receptors as Targets for therapy of pre-treated postmenopausal patients with ER/PgR-negative/AR-positive or ER and/or PgR-positive/AR-positive metastatic breast cancer. Study Design: Multicentric Open-label not randomized trial. Description of Study Treatment: Daily oral administration of DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone) at the dosage of 100 mg/die in combination with a daily oral administration of anastrozole at dosage of 1 mg/die or letrozole at the dosage of 2.5 mg/die or exemestane at the dosage of 25 mg/die without interruption until discontinuation for progression of disease unacceptable toxicity or discontinuation/withdrawal of participants from study treatment. Number of Subjects: 12 patients per group in the first step; if the number of responders is greater or equal to 2 recruitment will continue up to a total of 35 patients (per group). For the biological part we will evaluate:   1. Correlation between AR expression and clinical and biological features (tumor size nodal status histotype grading proliferative index ER PgR HER2)   2. Evaluation of AR expression on primitive and/or metastatic site in the two distinct populations of patients: ER/PgR- negative/ARpositive and ER-positive and/or PgR-positive/AR-positive   3. Evaluation of ER PgR HER2 expression on tumor cells of metastatic site (when it is possible) and comparison with the same features of primitive tumor.   4. CTCs analysis in term of molecular characteristics (gene expression and mutations) and functionality (vitality and tumorigenicity).   5. Prognostic and predictive role of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) evaluated at baseline before study treatment and at the moment of discontinuation of treatment.    ,NCT02000375
Breast Cancer,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Whole Body Including Diffusion in the Medical Evaluation of Breast Cancers at High Risk for Metastasis and the Follow-up of Metastatic Cancers, Whole-body MRI including diffusion is a booming technique. Numerous studies have demonstrated its interest in metastatic cancers. Breast cancers especially hormone-sensitive ones are very osteophilic and bones are the most frequent metastatic site. Apart from morphological criteria (lesion size and RECIST criteria) MRI provides quantitative functional criteria (diffusion and ADC values). According to a recent study whole body MRI is as good as PET/CT and more effective than bone scintigraphy for the diagnosis of bone metastases for cancers of breast and prostate with a high metastatic risk. Therefore it seems appropriate to study the performance of whole body MRI in the pre-therapeutic assessment of breast cancer with a high risk for metastasis and the monitoring of metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT02966574
Breast Cancer,Effect of a Mentor-based Supportive-expressive Program on Survival in Metastatic Breast Cancer," Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women and annually accounts for 10% of new malignancies worldwide. In mainland China approximately 169000 females are diagnosed with breast cancer every year and constitute 12.25% of the breast cancer incidents worldwide. Additionally 30% of early breast cancer turns metastatic which is often incurable. Different from women with early breast cancer women with metastatic breast cancer(MBC)must receive lifelong treatment experience higher levels of emotional/physical distress and feel frequent uncertainty about their health/possible death. They are also challenged to manage distressing adverse effects induced by different adjuvant treatments and experience heavy self-care demands during the transition period from being a patient to being a survivor. Thus specific interventions to help women with metastatic breast cancer to recover from this traumatic event have been designed and one of these is supportive-expressive group therapy(SEGT).SEGT has been found to achieve improvement in anxiety depression quality of life (QoL) family functioning and satisfaction with treatment. However the effect of SEGT on survival is inconsistent. Initial studies examining SEGT have reported a mean survival advantage of 18 months however these findings could not later be replicated.Yet no study has reported a survival disadvantage for those given SEGT. In addition we found no published articles on the application of SEGT among women with MBC in China. Owing to this dearth of previous research it is unclear whether this therapy would exhibit positive effects within Chinese culture. Thus we developed a ""Be Resilient to Breast Cancer""(BRBC) program that is culturally tailored for Chinese females with MBC. This program was adapted from SEGT and is designed to increase resilience(defined as the capacity to bounce back after encountering a traumatic event) and QoL decrease emotional and physical distress(allostatic load) and eventually prolong longevity. To better adapt to Chinese culture we added education hosted by professional staff (e.g. clinical psychologists dietician Chinese medicine practitioner etc.)in an effort to foster self-efficacy to combat symptoms (such as pain fatigue intrusive thoughts etc.) through knowledge and technics (such as breath control meditation etc.)and to help patients gain a sense of control in their life. Second trained mentors who were breast cancer survivors themselves were added to the group discussion to create non-hierarchical reciprocal relationships through the sharing of experiences with those facing similar challenges. These mentors also provided women with first-hand information about treatment and offered suggestions to combat barriers to recovery.    ",NCT03026374

Breast Cancer,Gemcitabine Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in the Treatment of Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer After Prior Trastuzumab/Pertuzumab or Pertuzumab Based Therapy, The purpose of this study is to see if a combination of drugs can help to treat breast cancer. This is a Phase II study which will test whether this combination of drugs is effective and will provide further information on side effects and safety. A standard chemotherapy gemcitabine will be combined with 2 other drugs that target the HER2 receptor. The HER2 receptor is a growth protein on the surface of some breast cancer cells that provides messages telling the breast cancer cell to grow. The standard chemotherapy will be gemcitabine.. The other two drugs work against HER2. One is called trastuzumab (Herceptin) and it is commonly given to women with advanced and early HER2 positive breast cancer. The other drug pertuzumab (Perjeta) is also given to women with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer. The drugs in this study are each individually approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. However this study is looking at the effectiveness of gemcitabine with trastuzumab and pertuzumab when given to women who have advanced HER2 positive breast cancer who have had prior trastuzumab + pertuzumab or pertuzumab-based therapy.    ,NCT02252887

Breast Cancer,Support and Rehabilitation Protocol for Non Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients in Complete Remission After Chemotherapy, Many breast cancer patients (BCP) will gain weight during chemotherapy and about 10% of them are able to find back to their initial weight after all treatments are finished. Other studies have shown that overweight at diagnosis was associated to a twice higher risk of relapse while a weight gain during treatments increased by 30% to 50% the risk of relapse. In western countries 75% of BCP have insufficient physical activity. Dietary and activity programs seem to be able to significantly reduce the mortality risk after breast cancer. The investigators performed a prospective randomized trial consisting in dietary counseling physical training and physiotherapy in hydrothermal centers. Intervention were delivered in small group session lasting 12 days. SPA cares were offered to patients. Patients in the control group also received dietary counseling given by a dietetician inside anticancer hospital and were asked to perform more physical activities.

Breast Cancer,Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Role of Exercise in Women Undergoing Treatment for Breast Cancer, TITLE: Randomized Controlled Evaluating the Role of Exercise in Women Undergoing Treatment for Breast Cancer Yoga and Quality of life: Yoga is based on the practice of physical postures breathing techniques and meditation. Philosophically it aims at increasing the body's ability to master the mind with the goal of spiritual awareness and connection. A randomized trial of yoga in women with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy demonstrated an improvement in impact of events scale at 3 months suggesting that the more intrusive thoughts at 1 month the greater the finding of meaning in cancer by 3 months. Randomized studies have demonstrated evidence of yoga improving the emotional well being of women with breast cancer and improving their distressed mood thus providing a buffering effect on QOL. The main beneficial effects demonstrated are on social functioning. Among patients not receiving chemotherapy yoga appears to enhance emotional well-being and mood and may serve to buffer deterioration in both overall and specific domains of QOL. EVALUATION TOOLS- European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 & BR-23) Brief Fatigue Inventory VAS (Pain score) Spirituality Questionnaire Pulmonary function test Objective assessment STUDY ENDPOINTS- Primary end points- Disease free survival Secondary end points- Quality of life & Improvements in overall survival STUDY DESIGN TREATMENT PLAN - All newly diagnosed cases with stage I-III of breast cancer who present to Tata Memorial Hospital will be randomly assigned to perform either a set of 'Yogic and Routine Exercises (referred to as exercise I) or Routine Exercises'(referred to as exercise II)./ Patients will begin the exercises within a week of starting treatment. Both arms of the study will receive a training session one hour per day for the first week during which they will be instructed to practice daily and maintain a daily log. The other evaluation tools will be used as per the assessment time line (enclosed).The exercises in the Exercise I arm (Yoga and conventional exercises) will be upgraded within the next 2 days to Phase II. Patients will be allowed to attend a minimum of four out of seven days in Phase I and II. Patients will be assessed at 6 months for compliance to phase II exercises. Only if patients are fulfilling the criteria for accuracy sequence and duration of phase II exercises will they be taught phase III exercises. Patients who are unable to do phase II exercises at 6 months will be re taught phase II exercises. These patients will then be re assessed at 1 year for up gradation to phase III. Six months after completion of phase III exercises patients will be assessed for compliance to phase III exercises. Patients will also undergo an objective assessment at 1 year. An additional up gradation will be after completion of adjuvant therapy at 6 months. Patients will be followed up for a period of 5 years. DFS will be measured from the time of randomization to either progression or death. Quality of life will be measured at baseline and every six monthly using the functional assessment cancer therapy- quality of life. Quality of Life analysis at 400 patients will be performed with appropriate correction for multiple analyses applied. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS- For an expected 50% 5 year disease free survival (DFS) for the control group the expected 5 years DFS for the intervention group will be 60%. With a two-sided analysis and at 80% power and 95% confidence to detect a 10% difference between the arms the sample size would be 761 patients. Assuming a 10% loss to follow up a total of 850 patients would be accrued. We expect to complete accrual in 3 year. RANDOMIZATION AND STRATIFICATION- Randomization for intervention will be done centrally from Clinical Research Secretariat and patient will be stratified by Menopausal status: Pre + Peri or Post Neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment Stage of disease: I/II/III ANALYSIS- Disease Free Survival (DFS) will be calculated from the date of randomization to the date of local regional or distant relapse or death from any cause and will be censored at the last date of follow up for the patients that are alive and disease free or have been lost to follow up. Overall Survival (OS) will be calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death or censored at the date of last follow up for the patients who are alive or lost to follow up. DFS and OS will be evaluated using Kaplan Meier and compared by Log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazard model will be used to assess the impact of intervention after correction for stratification menopausal status and age.    ,NCT02161900

Breast Cancer,Impact of a Telephonic Monitoring During Inter-treatment Intervals on Emotional State Quality of Life and Toxicities on Neo Adjuvant or Adjuvant Chemotherapy-treated Patients, In health care the phone has emerged as a clinical tool in its own right especially for the development of psychological support to patients and that in many pathologies. Its potential in the development of psycho-social support was quickly identified. However to our knowledge no prospective randomized studies have evaluated the impact of a telephone call to both the anxiety and the management of side effects of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient incomplete care by the hospital system and the general practitioner during chemotherapy as well as the lack of information and poor preparation and / or management of side effects are a source of distress and lead to a decrease quality of life for the patient and his family. We propose to determine on a population of 280 patients the impact of two phone calls during 3 first inter-treatment intervals on the overall measure of mood states of the patient and his principal caregiver (anxiety depression confusion angry fatigue force and interpersonal relation). We will also study the gain in quality of life on anxiety level frequency and severity of toxicities as well as emotional comfort of the procedure.    ,NCT01977053

Breast Cancer,Randomized Controlled Trial to Assess Blockade of Voltage Gated Sodium Channels During Surgery in Operable Breast Cancer, Voltage Gated Sodium Channels Over the years there is more evidence that ionic channels are involved in the oncogenic process. Among these voltage gated sodium channels (VGSC) expressed in non-nervous or non-muscular organs are often associated with the metastatic behavior of different cancers. Expression of VGSCs has been reported both in vitro and/or in vivo in a range of human carcinomas including breast cancer Ion channels are major signaling molecules expressed in a wide variety of tissues. They are involved in determining a variety of cellular functions like proliferation solute transport volume control enzyme activity secretion invasion gene-expression excitation-contraction coupling and intercellular communication.4 VGSC activity contributes to much cellular behavior integral to metastasis including cellular process extension lateral motility and galvanotaxis transverse invasion and secretory membrane activity. A correlation between Na transport and oncogenesis has been widely reported in literature. In 1980 transformed mouse mammary cells were shown to have 3-fold higher intra-cellular sodium content than untransformed cells.5 Additionally evidence suggest that increasing the inward sodium current through voltage gated sodium channels increased the invasive capacity of breast cancer.6 Also growth and proliferation of mammary adenocarcinoma cells can be inhibited by Amiloride suggesting that epithelial Na channels (ENaC) activity is correlated with proliferation of breast cancer cells Current evidence suggests that VGSC activity is necessary and sufficient for cancer cell invasiveness8. A recent in vitro study has shown that the human MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell line expressed functional VGSCs9. However the molecular nature of the VGSC and its functional relevance to breast cancer in vivo are currently under study. Surgical operations for cancer have been reported to induce dissemination of cancer cells into surrounding tissues or into the circulation1011and infiltration anesthetics can inhibit immune response12-14. Although the mechanism remains to be elucidated infiltration anesthetics such as lidocaine have membrane- stabilizing action (Seeman 1972) and these agents could have direct effects on cancer cells. Therefore it is important to clarify the effects of infiltration anesthetics on behavior of the tumor cells. Commonly used local anesthetic agents inhibit the VGSCs and also possess a unique membrane stabilizing action through other unknown mechanisms. A study by Mammota et al 15 reported that lignocaine effectively inhibited the invasive ability of human cancer (HT1080 HOS and RPMI-7951) cells at concentrations used in surgical operations (5-20 mM). Lidocaine reduced the invasion ability of these cells by partly inhibiting the shedding of HB-EGF from the cell surface and modulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration contributed to this action. In addition lidocaine (5-30 mM) infiltrated around the inoculation site inhibited pulmonary metastases of murine osteosarcoma (LM 8) cells in vivo. Dose of lidocaine15: 40 mM (1%) lidocaine is usually used for infiltration anesthesia for surgical operations. Lower concentrations (1-20mM) of lidocaine were sufficient to suppress the invasive ability of cancer cells14. One mM lidocaine inhibited the invasive ability of HT1080 cells by about 50% and 20 mM lidocaine inhibited the invasion ability completely. Lidocaine also inhibited dose-dependently the invasive ability of HOS and RPMI-7951 cells although it was less effective on HOS cells. Lignocaine exerts its anesthetic action by obstructing the sodium channel 16 however 10 mMof tetrodotoxin (TTX) a specific sodium channel inhibitor had little effect on the invasive ability of HT1080 cells. Ten mM lidocaine-N-ethylbromide (NEB) which does not cross the cell membrane also had little effect on the invasive ability of the cells. Objectives Primary Objective: ??To assess the in-vivo ability of local anesthetics agents like lignocaine to decrease the dissemination of cancer cells during surgery and improve the disease free interval Secondary Objective ??To assess the in-vivo ability of local anesthetics agents like lignocaine on impacting long term survival. Methodology / Treatment plan The study drug (0.5% lidocaine 60mM) will be tested in the intraoperative setting prior to surgery will be tested in a randomized setting.: Arm A: 60mM of 0.5% lignocaine will be injected peritumoral prior to excision. The local anesthetic should be injected on all 6 surfaces of the tumor and also within the tumor. Wait for 7 minutes for its action followed by surgery.

Breast Cancer,Assessment of the Mutation of Pig-A Gene as Biomarker of Genotoxic Exposure in Humans, The evaluation of the impact of environment on the incidence of cancer is a major public health issue. Increased knowledge in this area is necessary for the implementation of primary prevention means with appropriate preventive measures but also to the implementation of secondary prevention measures with targeted screening actions. Among the environmental exposures that may lead to cancer mutagenic environments are of major importance and the causal link between environmental genotoxicity and cancer has been established for a long time. It is also well established that susceptibility to mutation is highly variable among individuals. This is explained by genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in metabolism and in genome stability. The identification of biomarkers of exposure to mutagenic environments is necessary for assessing the impact of an environment in humans. Some studies in animals have shown that the PIG-A gene may be a biomarker of exposure to a mutagenic environment. In particular a significant increase in erythrocyte PIG-A mutants has been demonstrated in rats after a genotoxic exposure to cisplatin but it has so far not been evaluated in humans. One study of healthy volunteers shows that the frequency of PIG-A mutated cells in humans can be estimated efficiently and reliably. The PIG-A gene meets all the necessary criteria for a sentinel gene for tracking of spontaneous somatic mutation frequency or induced a mutagenic environment: ubiquitous expression phenotypic change linked to a mono-allelic mutation viability of mutated cells  spectrum off inactivating mutations (deletions substitutions chromosomal rearrangements). Finally the detection of the disappearance of glycosylphosphatidylinositol on the plasma membrane is easily achievable by flow cytometry.    ,NCT02727868

Breast Cancer,"Trial Comparing Calendula Officinalis With Aqueous Cream ""Essex"" to Treat Skin Reactions From Radiotherapy of Breast Cancer", Acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR) occur in the majority of patients undergoing postoperative radiotherapy (RT). Some patients experience more severe reactions such as dry and/or moist desquamation but most patients experience mild reactions e.g. erythema (Lopez et al. 2005). The radiation dose volume RT technique and previous treatment such as type of surgery and previous chemotherapy are factors that might impact on the risk for ARSR together with patient-related factors such as body mass index (BMI) smoking status and previous skin damage (Porock et al. 1998; Wells et al. 2004). In a pilot study (n=93) of the frequency of ARSR in patients with breast cancer who underwent adjuvant RT it was shown that 93% developed ARSR mostly mild reactions. Patients reported low scores on pain and itching (Sharp et al. 2011). Over 80% of the patients reported adherence to the skin care recommendations which included application of a thin layer of Essex® cream a non-perfumed aqueous cream on the irradiated area at least two times a day (Sharp et al. 2011). The effects of skin care products containing Calendula Officinalis (marigold plant) on ARSR in patients with breast cancer were investigated in a randomized clinical trial (Pommier et al. 2004). Patients in the experimental group treated with calendula cream had a statistically significant lower incidence of severe ARSR pain and treatment interruptions in comparison with the patients in the control group treated with trolamine. The purpose of this blinded randomized clinical trial is to compare two topical agents Calendula Weleda® cream and Essex® cream in terms of efficacy to reduce the risk of severe acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR) in relation to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for breast cancer. Patients were instructed to apply a thin layer of the assigned cream twice a day starting at the onset of RT and continue until two weeks after termination or until the ARSR is healed. The application should include the whole treatment area including the armpit and shoulder/back area in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy. Patients are also advised to not apply the cream within two hours before the RT in order to avoid possible build-up effect. Daily wash with perfume free soap and tap water are recommended and patients are advised to refrain from use of other topical agents in the irradiated area. The primary endpoint is the efficacy to reduce acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR) assessed with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/The Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (RTOG/EORTC scale) at follow-up. Secondary endpoints include patient reported outcome measures; Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) Sleep disturbances (MOS-sleep questionnaire) and symptoms experienced from the irradiated area (visual analogue scale). Patients' experiences and adherence to the topical agents are also evaluated. A total of 400 patients are required to detect a true absolute reduction in the proportion of patients with ARSR from 35% with standard treatment (Essex® cream) to 20% with the experimental treatment (Calendula Weleda® cream) with a significance level of 5% a power of 90%. With this sample size 95% confidence intervals for the difference in proportions are estimated to be in the order of ±10%. Assuming a rate of 5% of non-responders the target size has been set to 420 patients.    ,NCT01688479

Breast Cancer,Neoadjuvant Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide Followed by Docetaxel (AC-Doc) Versus Dose-Dense Doxorubicin and Docetaxel (ADoc) in Breast Cancer, The primary objective of this trial is to compare the rate of pathologically complete remissions achieved using a preoperative dose-intensified 8 week therapy consisting of adriamycin and docetaxel with a preoperative sequential 24 week regimen consisting of adriamycin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel in patients with operable carcinoma of the breast. Secondary aims are to assess disease-free and overall survival the rate of complete and partial responses by palpation and imaging methods the rate of breast-conserving operations and the toxicity of the two chemotherapy regimens. Women meeting the following criteria will be eligible for the study: those with operable breast cancer (T2-3 N0-2 M0) with the diagnosis histologically confirmed by biopsy and measurable disease on mammography or sonography or breast MRI (the most appropriate method should be chosen by the investigator). After the patients have given written informed consent they will be randomly assigned to the study treatments. Patients in group I will receive four cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of adriamycin 50 mg/m2 (15 min i.v. infusion) and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (1 h i.v. infusion) repeated every 14 days followed by surgery 9-10 weeks after the start of therapy. Patients in group II will receive four cycles of adriamycin 60 mg/m2 (15 min i.v.) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (1 h i.v.) every three weeks followed by four cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m2 (1 h i.v.) every three weeks. Surgery will be performed during week 25 or 26. Patients in both groups will additionally receive oral doses of tamoxifen 20 mg once daily for 5 years starting on the first day of chemotherapy. Surgery will consist of removal of the remaining tumor (breast-conserving resection or mastectomy) and axillary dissection (Sentinel node biopsy is allowed if the patient is involved in a randomized trial. Radiotherapy is applicated according to standard proceedings of participating center.

Breast Cancer,Efficacy and Safety of Cabazitaxel Versus Weekly Paclitaxel as Neo-adjuvant Treatment in Patients With Triple Negative or Luminal B/HER2 Normal BC (GENEVIEVE), Cabazitaxel is a new taxoid which promotes the tubulin assembly in vitro and stabilizes microtubules against cold-induced depolymerization as efficiently as docetaxel and was selected for development based on a better antiproliferative activity on resistant cell lines than docetaxel. It has shown superior survival against mitoxantrone (MTX) plus prednisone in docetaxel pre-treated hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer patients leading to registration of the compound. It showed a favorable toxicity profile with an interestingly low rate of alopecia. In the Genevieve study it will be compared against weekly paclitaxel which is currently most widely used treatment of breast cancer patients. A head-to-head comparison in the neoadjuvant setting will allow a rapid and precise comparison of efficacy and tolerability of cabacitaxel versus paclitaxel to decide in how far further development of this taxoid in breast cancer is reasonable.    ,NCT01779479

Breast Cancer,Phase II Window of Opportunity Study of Short-term Preoperative Treatment With Enzalutamide (Alone or in Combination With Exemestane) in Patients With Primary Breast Cancer, This study is being carried out to see if the antiandrogen enzalutamide has antitumour effects in early breast cancer. Enzalutamide blocks the action of androgens on the androgen receptor (AR) and may slow down or stop breast cancers growing. Enzalutamide is approved for the treatment of prostate cancer. The trial will be offered to patients who have just been diagnosed with early breast cancer and who are planned to have surgery in the next few weeks. The treatment will bridge the time between the diagnosis and surgery and will be given for 2- 4 weeks. To assess the effect of the treatment small samples of breast cancer tissue will be analysed before the start and after treatment. The pre-treatment assessment will be done on archived tissue but patients might require an additional biopsy if sufficient stored tumour tissue is not available. The end of treatment samples will be taken during surgery unless the patient will receive medical treatment first instead of surgery which might mean additional biopsies of the breast cancer have to be taken. The trial has two cohorts. The cohort of patients with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer will test if adding enzalutamide to exemestane is better at slowing the growth of breast cancer than exemestane alone. This cohort will recruit 141 evaluable post-menopausal patients with a tumour size of at least 1 cm. The aromatase inhibitor exemestane is approved for the treatment of ER positive breast cancer. Blocking aromatase decreases oestrogens but can increase androgens. Enzalutamide is therefore added to block the action of androgens on the AR. In the second cohort of patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) enzalutamide will be given alone to see if it can slow the growth tumours with androgen receptors. As only approximately 30% of TNBCs express the AR a pre screening step will be included to test the tumour AR expression before patients are approached for the ARB trial. The TNBC cohort will comprise 55 patients.    ,NCT02676986
Breast Cancer,A Study of Zoledronic Acid in the Prevention of Cancer Therapy-induced Bone Loss, Breast cancer and osteoporosis are two of the most frequent diseases in women. Estrogen may be associated with bone loss and the risk of breast cancer because of its potent effects on the mitotic activity of breast epithelium and on bone turnover. This study is will assess the safety and efficacy of Zoledronic acid 4 mg given every 3 months over 24 months in improving bone mineral density in premenopausal women with hormone receptor negative breast cancer and adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment compared to placebo. This study is not recruiting patients in the United States.    ,NCT00333229
Breast Cancer,Safety Study of Adding Everolimus to Adjuvant Hormone Therapy in Women With High Risk of Relapse ER+ and HER2- Primary Breast Cancer Free of Disease After Receiving at Least One Year of Adjuvant Hormone Therapy, A significant number of patients relapse and eventually die particularly if they were initially diagnosed with large nodes involvement and/or T3/4 diseases. When analyses focus on patients with ER+/Her2-negative breast cancer with ??N+ 30% had relapsed at 5 years emphasizing the need for new drugs in this setting (PACS01 data UNICANCER internal data). Strong evidence suggests that cross-talk between the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and ER signaling is linked to hormone resistance in breast cancer patients. In the present study we plan to evaluate the benefit from adding everolimus to standard endocrine treatments after three years of treatment for patient ER+/HER2- at high risk of relapse due to high nodes involvement (??) and/or persistent node involvement after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Genomic signatures have emerged during the last 10 years as a new and additive means to evaluate more precisely long term prognosis and in some instances the amount of benefit from chemotherapy or endocrine therapy in the adjuvant setting. Therefore the UNIRAD study can be proposed to patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes at primary surgery and a high risk of relapse with the EndoPredict test. This study is a unique opportunity to prove the efficacy of everolimus in adjuvant setting. The study could be practice changing in case of positive results and could allow improving outcome of breast cancer patients presenting high risk of metastatic relapse.    ,NCT01805271
Breast Cancer,Perioperative Administration of COX 2 Inhibitors and Beta Blockers to Women Undergoing Breast Cancer Surgery, Surgery for breast cancer has a major role in enhancing long term survival and cure but several physiological aspects associated with surgery are implicated as enhancing tumor spread and formation of distant metastases. These include: an increase in pro-angiogenic factors direct spread of tumor cells accumulation of grown factors immune suppression and direct effects of anesthetics and opiate pain relievers on cancer cells. Some of these pro-metastatic mechanism may be blocked by the interventions proposed in this study namely by administration of beta-adrenergic blockers and COX2 inhibitors around the time of surgery. Studies have shown that surgery increases levels of catecholamines and prostaglandins which in turn may promote the release of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF and enhance vascularization of micro metastases. Opiates given for pain relief during and after surgery have been reported to enhance tumor cell division and cause immune suppression. The immune system is significantly suppressed during surgery. This suppression has been shown to affect the systemic resistance to infection as well as neoplastic metastatic processes. Several studies have shown that increased levels of catecholamines and prostaglandins add to the immune suppression. Studies in rats found that peri-operative administration of the beta beta-blocker propranolol together with the COX2 inhibitor etodolac significantly reduced the suppression of NK cell activity as well as the risk for distant metastases. A recent retrospective clinical study found that among breast cancer patients treated with a combination of regional anesthesia and a COX inhibitor the recurrence rated were significantly less than among patients undergoing surgery without these two interventions. The purpose of the proposed prospective trial is to examine if peri-operative administration of the combination of a beta-blocker together with a COX2 inhibitor will prevent suppression of cellular immunity decrease VEGF levels and decrease cancer recurrence rates. In the proposed study breast cancer patients will be treated with a combination of a beta-blocker and COX2 inhibitor (or placebo) before during and after surgery. (A control group of healthy women will serve as untreated controls). The variables which will be examined are: number and activity of NK cells levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines serum stress hormones and angiogenic factors and the ability of leukocytes to produce Th1 and Th2 cytokines as a result of in vitro stimulation. In addition to these immediate parameters long term follow up will be conducted in order to determine the effect of the intervention on long term cancer recurrence over five years. Statistical analysis will be done using t-tests ANOVA and multivariate regressions with regard to the known risk factors for recurrence such as tumor grade lymph node involvement etc. Sample size for immunological parameters will be 40 patients in each group and 20 healthy women. Sample size for estimates of cancer recurrence at five years of follow up wiil be 460 women (230 in each group). This sample size provides a power of 80% to detect a 50% reduction in cancer recurrence at an α of 0.05.    ,NCT00502684

Breast Cancer,Diagnostic Accuracy and Safety Study of FES PET/CT in Assessment of ER Status of Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer, The standard diagnostic workup for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer includes biopsy and determination of tumor estrogen status according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network and European Society for Medical Oncology. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is currently the most commonly used method for determining ER status. A investigational imaging tracer named 16-alpha-[18F]-fluoro-17-beta-estradiol or [18F]fluoroestradiol ([18F]FES) acts similarly in vivo to estradiol and binds to estrogen receptors (ERs). Previous studies in human have shown the efficacy of [18F]FES PET in detecting ER positive breast cancer without any observed toxicity. The investigators hypothesized that [18F]FES PET imaging can noninvasively assess ER status in recurrent or metastatic breast cancer lesion . In this study a positive and negative percent agreement between IHC and [18F]FES will be determined.    ,NCT01986569

Breast Cancer,Intraoperative Imagery of Breast Cancer With Folate-FITC (EC17), Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second cause of cancer mortality in women. There are approximately 200000 new cases of breast cancer a year. Classically breast cancers are divided into two groups invasive and non-invasive. A mainstay of the treatment of both of these types is surgical resection not only for therapeutic purposes but also for diagnostic purposes. Breast conserving therapy includes surgical lumpectomy and post-operative radiation. However despite best surgical practices when patients undergo BCT anywhere from 20 - 40% of these patients have margins positive for cancer. This leads to increased rates of reoperation which are quoted to be as high as 30% and increased local recurrences. There is an over expression of folate receptors located on the surface of many human carcinoma nodules.Specifically for breast cancer up to 33% of all breast cancers over express the folate receptor. Folate-fluorescein isothiocyanate or folate-FITC also identified as EC-17 targets folate receptors over expressed in certain cancers such as breast cancer and could help in better identifying the margins of the cancer thereby achieving negative margins.    ,NCT01994369

Breast Cancer,Effect of Combined Exercise Post-treatment Intervention in Lean Mass Recovery in Breast Cancer Survival.," Breast cancer survival it is affected by the side effects related to the illness the treatments or even the behavioral factors (e.g. inadequate diet sedentary behavior) that create in this women an important quantity of psychological and physical disorders. Prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrate that supervised aerobic training is a safe feasible and effective adjunct therapy to improve a broad range of physiological and psychological outcomes in women with early breast cancer. However the vast majority of studies to date have focused on the efficacy of exercise to improve symptom control outcomes in breast cancer patients either during or following the completion of adjuvant therapy. Most relevant consequences are found in women that have to undergo surgery as 16% to 43% of women with breast cancer suffer functional limitation in the shoulder inflammation pain or strength and flexibility reduction in upper body limbs one year after surgery with a high prevalence which is rising. Weight gain is associated with decreased quality of life and increased risk for several comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The most of the cardiopulmonary problems are induced by chemotherapy or radiotherapy because of the treatments effect in the heart and its consequences in cardiorespiratory fitness of these women. These side effects become in important limitations to allow women return their normal life style. These limitations have a severe effect in decreasing of physical activity practice which have visible consequences in increasing general fatigue and calcium deficiency in bones due to the age and some adjuvant treatments. Previous studies found that patients with breast cancer who gained modest amounts of weight were significantly more likely to experience disease recurrence and die from breast cancer and other causes that those who were weight stable. In addition two thirds of the studies that have assessed body composition change in relation to weight gain in this patient population observe no net gain in muscle mass or loss in muscle mass as body weight and adipose tissue increase. These changes are defined as sarcopenic obesity. This kind of obesity is characterized by weight gain in the presence of lean tissue loss or absence of lean tissue gain. In addition fat tissue gain is related with other health disorders such as diabetes functional limitations and poor survival levels. Treatment for this unique pattern of weight gain is an exercise intervention especially strength training. Psychological effects have to be took account as cancer produce important aftermath. Large scientific evidence shows the psycho-emotional alterations in women diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their life. World Health Organization (WHO) defines quality of life as ""individuals perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals expectations standards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept affected in a complex way by the person's physical health psychological state level of independence social relationships personal beliefs and their relationship to salient features of their environment."" Following this definition numbered of researches have been developed presenting interest in both physiological and psychological changes and improvements as show different studies. HYPOTHESIS The primary hypothesis of this study is that group exercise intervention combining aerobic and strength training will reduce lean mass and body fat tissue in breast cancer post treatment survival. Secondary hypothesis of this clinical trial are follows:   1. Combined exercise intervention will increase maximal strength level of chest press and leg press.   2. Combined exercise intervention will increase maximal cardiopulmonary capacity assessed by Peak Oxygen Consumption(VO2peak) which has been confirmed as an important value in survivals. In addition ACSM propose this value as the Gold Standard to assess fitness level.   3. Combined exercise intervention will increase global Isometric Strength Index assessed by Grip Strength Dynamometer.   4. Combined exercise intervention will improve range motion in upper-limbs.   5. Patients Reported Outcomes (PROs) such as quality of life (QoL) Health perception and depression.    ",NCT01843608

Breast Cancer,Partial Breast Radiation to the Lumpectomy Cavity With IMRT in Elderly Women, The standard treatment for women with invasive breast cancer is local excision follow by whole breast radiation. The local recurrence rates are low side effects are low and the cosmetic outcome is excellent. The treatments however need to be given daily for 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 weeks making the treatment difficult particularly for the elderly and for women who need to travel long distances for the therapy. The goal of this study is to determine the toxicity and efficacy of giving the radiation in a shorter time using higher daily doses of radiation. The risk of recurrence in the elderly population is lower and since majority of recurrences occur close to the area where the tumor previously was it is hypothesized that radiation to that area of the breast would be sufficient to obtain low risk of recurrence. When a smaller volume of tissue is treated more radiation can be given daily and therefore the treatment can be shortened. The risk of side effects increases as the dose per daily treatment increases. Therefore the goal is to study the short term side effects long term side effects and cosmetic outcome of daily radiation using higher daily doses for shorter period of time. We will also follow the recurrence rate. Because less of the breast tissue will be treated there may be a small increased risk of recurrence. Because the higher fraction size can result in more side effects we will be using intensity modulated radiation (IMRT). IMRT is the most advanced individually tailored radiation treatment technique that results in the least amount of side effects. It allows tight monitoring of the dose in the untreated breast. Seventy five women diagnosed with stage I breast cancer will participate. Participants must have a lumpectomy clear margins and no lymphovascular invasion to be eligible. A treatment planning CT scan will be obtained. If the lumpectomy cavity can be clearly delineated an IMRT plan will be generated with predefined strict dose requirement criteria. The patients will be treated once daily 5 days a week for a total of 10 treatments (instead of standard 28-33). The patients will be evaluated for toxicity weekly during the treatment and weekly for additional 4 weeks. At each of these evaluations they will fill out a short 10 minute questionnaire detailing their side effects. Follow-up will continue every 3 months for 3 years and every 6 months for 2 more years. At each of these follow-ups a short questionnaire will be filled out by the patients detailing any toxicity as well as their perception of the cosmetic outcome. A cosmesis questionnaire will be also be filled out by the evaluating physician before radiation at 6 12 18 and 24 months and yearly for 3 more years. A total of 5 years of follow-up is planned. Participants will also have the option of consenting to the photograph portion of the study. Those who do will have photographs taken of their breasts (excluding faces) at the time they complete the cosmetic questionnaire to evaluate the cosmetic outcome.    ,NCT00337064

Breast Cancer,Comparison of Use of Indocyanine Green and 99mTc-labeled Radiotracer for Axillary Lymphatic Mapping in Patients With Breast Cancer, This clinical trial will enroll up to 130 adult women with a confirmed diagnosis of clinical stage 1 or 2 breast cancer who are undergoing breast cancer surgery with lumpectomy or mastectomy and planned axillary sentinel node biopsy procedure. Patients will undergo lymphatic mapping with technetium Tc-99m (99mTc) sulfur colloid in accordance with routine clinical practice. Injections of 99mTc sulfur colloid will take place the afternoon prior to planned next morning surgery or on the morning of surgery. Patients will undergo lymphoscintigraphy in accordance with standard clinical practice. Immediately prior to operation after the induction of anesthesia in the operating room up to 1cc of 0.5% indocyanine green (ICG) solution will be injected subdermally close to the tumor or into the subareolar region after disinfection of the breast skin. ICG movement will be facilitated by manual massage and monitored with fluorescence imaging. ICG fluorescence will be elicited and detected by Photodynamic Eye (PDE) camera. The lymphatic drainage made evident by the fluorescent dye will be monitored in real time on a monitor. The fluorescence will be followed towards the armpit region (axilla) and time for the fluorescence to reach the axilla will be recorded. Following standard practice an incision will be made in the armpit region. Fluorescent lymph nodes (ICG positive) will be localized and removed and analyzed by a pathologist. Node removal will continue until no residual fluorescence is visible in the axilla. Removed nodes will be tested for radioactivity using a standard gamma-detecting probe and the counts per minute will be recorded. Finally the armpit region will be inspected with the gamma probe to determine if there are any residual radioactive nodes. Residual sentinel nodes (the first node to receive lymph from a tumor) will be removed. For the purposes of this study the sentinel status of a node will be defined as being flagged as sentinel by either one or both of the ICG or 99mTc methods. The goal of the project is to confirm that axillary lymphatic mapping with ICG leads to similar nodes being labeled as sentinel as lymphatic mapping with 99mTc-labeled radiotracer.    ,NCT02419807

Breast Cancer,A Randomized Open-label Phase III Trial of Mapisal® Versus an Urea Hand-foot Cream as Prophylaxis for Capecitabine-induced Hand-foot Syndrome in Patients With Gastrointestinal Tumors or Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is the examination of Mapisal® versus urea hand-foot cream as prophylaxis for capecitabine-induced hand-foot syndrome (HFS) in patients with gastrointestinal tumors or breast cancer to assess the efficacy of Mapisal®. Mapisal® is a medical device that is approved for the prophylaxis and treatment of HFS. Initial clinical data and case studies on the treatment and prophylaxis of Caelyx-induced HFS have been impressive. Because the pathomechanism of HFS caused by capecitabine is the same as for Caelyx-induced HFS it is expected reason that administering Mapisal® should result in a significant reduction of HFS caused by capecitabine. The urea hand-foot cream was selected for the standard arm because it is used commonly is accepted by patients and seems to have a positive influence on the severity of the HFS in the experience of many oncologists.    ,NCT01626781
Breast Cancer,Predictive Model of Therapy Outcomes in Breast Cancer Patients, Patients with breast cancer who are treated with curative intent have a combination of surgery (excision of the tumor) and a course of medical therapy (chemotherapy or endocrine treatment). Both treatments are associated with significant side effects. Chemotherapy is associated with nausea vomiting hair loss and bone marrow suppression whereas endocrine therapy is associated with arthritis and menopausal symptoms. Patients taking either chemotherapy or endocrine treatment may experience a range of side effects. The range and severity of side effects experienced vary from patient to patient. Little or nothing is known about the reason for this difference. The aim of the investigators proposal is to develop a pretreatment test to identify patients who are likely to undergo moderate to severe side effects and therefore help doctors and patients plan and optimize medical therapy. The pretreatment test will be based on identifying a metabolic profile which can differentiate those patients who are likely to have severe or moderate side effects from those with either no or mild side effects. To do this the investigators will take urine and blood samples from patients before and after the administration of endocrine treatment or chemotherapy and generate metabolic profiles. Furthermore the investigators aim to gain an understanding into why side effects experienced between different patients are so variable. To do this the investigators plan to perform cytokine analysis targeted genetic analysis and pharmaokinetic analysis on blood sample collected from patients before and after treatment has commenced. Patients who have planned surgical excision of tumor and are recommended to receive medical therapy before or after surgery would be invited to join the study. Each patient will be required to make additional visits to the hospital to complete questionnaires regarding side effects experienced and for sample (urine and blood) collection. The investigators plan to recruit 168 patients.    ,NCT01563211
Breast Cancer,A Phase 2 Study of Standard Chemotherapy Plus BSI-201 (a PARP Inhibitor) in the Neoadjuvant Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer, This study will investigate whether the neoadjuvant combination of gemcitabine carboplatin and BSI-201 will cause a high percentage of triple negative breast cancer patients to achieve a pathologic complete response prior to surgery. Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.    ,NCT00813956

Breast Cancer,Comparison Study of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Chinese Triple Negative Breast Cancer, Previous studies in Western country show that triple-negative breast cancer has aggressive clinical and pathological features compared with non-triple negative breast cancer including onset at a young age advanced clinical stage high histologic and nuclear grade and more distant recurrence. According to the characteristics of triple negative breast tumor the TNBC patients can benefit neither from hormonal therapies nor from target therapies against Her2 receptors. The only systemic therapy currently available is chemotherapy and prognosis remains poor. It becomes more and more important to investigate the sensitive chemotherapy regimen for triple negative patients. Cisplatin-based regimen was active for the patients of lung cancer colorectal cancer and ect. Triple negative breast cancer patients were more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy regimens according to the results of some retrospective studies. The investigators hypothesized that paclitaxel combined with cisplatin is more sensitive to triple negative breast cancer compared with CEF followed by docetaxel.    ,NCT01216111

The safety of single-agent nab-paclitaxel has been determined in previous studies of participants with mBC and the safety data to date suggest that atezolizumab can be safely combined with standard chemotherapy agents.    ,NCT02425891
Breast Cancer,Safety and Immunogenicity of a Personalized Synthetic Long Peptide Breast Cancer Vaccine Strategy in Patients With Persistent Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, The most important consideration in the design of this clinical trial is to ensure the safe translation of the personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dictates that initial studies of biologic therapies be performed in such a way that there is a balance between the potential risks and benefits in individual patients. Consistent with these recommendations the investigators will target patients with triple-negative breast cancer who do not have a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These patients typically have no gross evidence of disease following standard of care therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy surgery and radiation therapy) but are at extremely high-risk for disease recurrence. Targeting this patient population provides a window-of-opportunity to design and manufacture the personalized cancer vaccines maximizes the potential benefit from the vaccine as the regulatory networks associated with metastatic disease are not present and balances risk in this patient population with extremely high risk for disease recurrence but no other treatment options.    ,NCT02427581
Breast Cancer,Trial of Afatinib With Paclitaxel for Neoadjuvant Therapy of TNBC and Research of Biomarkers of Afatinib, [Background]: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of both estrogen and progesterone receptor as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). TNBC is characterized by distinct molecular histological and unfavorable clinical features despite the high rates of response to chemotherapy. Based on the above reasons it is important to emergently develop novel therapies and/or treatment strategies to increase treatment efficacies and the survival rate of TNBC. [Rationale]: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) and EGFR mutation have been reported in TNBC and may therefore be a valid target for anti-tumor therapy in TNBC. Afatinib (BIBW 2992) is an ErbB-family blocker that irreversibly inhibits signaling from all relevant ErbB-family dimers. Afatinib has demonstrated preclinical activity in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines and xenograft models of breast cancer and clinical activity in phase I studies. Based on the assumption that uncontrolled ErbB-signaling is directly related to an increased oncogenic potential in TNBC the studying afatinib in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC patients is important and provides a novel therapy. [Aims] The primary endpoint is to evaluate the pathologic complete response of the combination of afatinib and weekly paclitaxel in TNBC patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment. The secondary endpoints are to evaluate the clinical response and safety of afatinib with and without paclitaxel and to explore the different afatinib-affecting downstream molecular pathways as well as potential biomarkers predicting the response of afatinib with and without paclitaxel. [Patients and methods]: Patients with TNBC (clinical T2-T3 N0-N1 M0; clinical T1-3 N1-2 M0; or any T4a tumor) and received neoadjuvant treatment will included in this open label multi-center phase II study. Our schema is as follows: (1) Afatinib 40 mg per day for 14 days then evaluation every subject will go into the following phase no matter whether she had response or not (2) the following phase (the combination with afatinib and paclitaxel): Afatinib 40 mg per day day 1 to day 21 in combination with paclitaxel 80 mg/m² on days 1 8 15 in a 3-weekly course. In addition to the clinical assessment we will evaluate the potential predictive biological markers of activity of Afatinib with and without paclitaxel and dynamic changes of molecular makers ([serum and tissue samples: before treatment 2 weeks after treatment and operation timing]; potential molecules such as EGFR EGFR-signaling FGFR FGFR-signaling ERK p53 NF-κB and etc. were evaluated through the immunohistochemical stains mutation analysis mRNA [RT-PCR] single nucleotide polymorphism analysis and FISH analysis). In addition the genetic expression profiles will be compared between afatinib-responsive and afatinib-unresponsive samples. [Expected Results]: The promising clinical activity tolerable toxicity and potential biomarkers of afatinib with and without paclitaxel in TNBC patients receiving neoadjuvant setting will be demonstrated. The results from this study can be used to conduct a larger trial that would allow us to confirm or validate the hypotheses generated.    ,NCT02511847
Breast Cancer,Zoledronic Acid as Adjuvant Treatment of Triple-negative Breast Cancer, Triple-negative breast cancer is a special type of breast cancer with poor prgnosis and limited choices. Chemotherapy is the only choice of adjuvant systemic treatment options. Previous study suggested that zoledronic acid might have anti-tumor effect by eliminating the number of DTCs(Disseminated Tumor Cell )and had been proved to be effective as adjvant therapy in postmenopausal women whose breast cancer was Homonal receptor positive and who were receiving aromatase inhibitors. So it might be able to improve the survival of triple negative breast cancer patients.    ,NCT02595138

Breast Cancer,Safety and Tolerability of Everolimus in Combination With Eribulin in Triple-negative Breast Cancers, Treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) relies heavily on different regimes of chemotherapeutic agents but remains one of the most challenging subtypes to treat because of the lack of specific therapies. Despite being sensitive to chemotherapy many women with TNBC relapse quickly developing locoregional recurrence or visceral metastasis. Toxicity and chemotherapy resistance are still major limitations in the treatment of patients with TNBC. Despite current trend of targeted therapy development cytotoxic agents are a mainstay of treatment of patients with breast cancer. Further research into new combination of different compounds is needed in order to maximise benefit whilst minimising toxicity. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumor agents. This has been described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with varying mechanisms of action including taxanes and DNA-damaging agents. In the clinic activated PI3K in tumors has been correlated with decreased response to therapy and worse clinical outcomes. The recent biological findings suggest that a PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors may increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents which are considered standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of several solid tumors. The study by the Unitaed state Oncology Research of Huston and the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center randomized 1830 patients with high risk breast cancer to the standard adjuvant treatment with adriamicin cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel versus the experimental adjuvant treatment with adriamicin taxotere (AT) followed by paclitaxel. At 5-years of follow up the AT followed by paclitaxel produced significantly better overall survival (p=0.054) and improved disease free survival (DFS) (p=0.19). Among TNBC patients both DFS (74% versus 79% p=0.1) and overall survival (OS) (79% versus 84% p=0.037) were better in experimental arm. However the main reasons for patients being taken off study treatment were toxicity (85 patients in the control arm and 128 in the experimental arm) and consent withdrawal (18 patients in the control arm and 30 patients in the experimental arm). For this reason research into alternatives has intensified thus resulting in the discovery and development of new compounds with a more tolerable profile as compared with paclitaxel. Among the total of 762 patients enrolled into Eisai Metastatic Breast Cancer Study Assessing Physician's Choice Versus E7389 (EMBRACE) trial 19% had TNBC. Of note eribulin was most effective in hormone receptor-negative patients and in TNBC patients who had a 29% risk reduction. Treatment with eribulin was well tolerated. Neutropenia leucopenia peripheral neuropathy and asthenia/fatigue were the most common adverse events reported at Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades 3 and 4. Neutropenia was the most common adverse events reported at CTCAE grade 4 in the eribulin group (24.1%). Based on findings to date eribulin is an attractive agent and its role in combination with new compounds such as everolimus deserves further investigations. Their combination might lead to more profound effects on tumor cell biology of triple negative metastatic breast cancer. During the course of the trial dose reductions for each combination will be permitted in patients who cannot tolerate the starting dose    ,NCT02616848
Breast Cancer,A Pilot Surveillance Study to Monitor Natural Killer Cells and Circulating Tumor Cells in Women With Previously Treated Non-metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer and Women With Previously Treated Non-metastatic Breast Cancer With a Confirmed BRCA Mutation., The purpose of this research study is:   -  To test blood for the presence of tumor derived circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using an investigational medical device called the LiquidBiopsy®. Using the LiquidBiopsy® platform recovered cells or DNA can also be investigated to obtain genetic information that may be useful to treating physicians in understanding disease.   -  To test blood for natural killer cells (NK cells) which are part of the body's natural immune defense against tumors. A device called the NK VueTM Kit will be used for this test. The LiquidBiopsy® is a new investigational device. An investigational device is one that is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The NK VueTM Kit is an investigational device in the United States but is approved in Canada and South Korea as a class II device. If a tumor is present very tiny numbers of tumor cells or the contents of these tumor cells can get dislodged from the tumor and swept into the bloodstream. The LiquidBiopsy® device is able to purify the tiny numbers of tumor cells or ctDNA in the blood. Even if a tumor is too small to be found by other means such as an x-ray it is possible that ctDNA or CTCs may be found in the blood. Genetic information can then be recovered from these cells or DNA to look for genetic changes that are related to the abnormal growth in a tumor. This will potentially allow researchers to study tumor cells or tumor DNA from a blood sample instead of a biopsy sample. This may influence cancer diagnosis treatment and drug selection in the future. NK cells occur naturally in the body and kill tumor cells. This study will measure the activity of the NK cells in blood. A strong correlation between low NK cell activity and increased circulating tumor cells in blood has been reported.    ,NCT02639832

Breast Cancer,The Clinical Significance of Cellular Immune Adjuvant Therapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer, As a special type of breast cancer the triple negative breast cancer has the characteristics of high recurrence rate (2 years after surgery) high distant metastasis rate poor prognosis and short survival time. No matter at home or abroad the clinical researches of the triple negative breast cancer are mainly focused on finding new drugs and new treatment strategies in order to reduce its recurrence and distant metastasis rate. The DC/CIK cell immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy in the clinical study of metastatic triple negative breast cancer has already confirmed benefit. This study is based on the theory that the optimal timing of cellular immunity is while the host tumor load is under the smallest state. Put forward the hypothesis that the DC/CIK cell immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy may improve the disease-free survival and overall surviva after the triple negative breast cancer operation. The investigators intends to use the RCT observing the clinical significance of cellular immune adjuvant therapy of triple negative breast cancer in 340 patients with TNBC. Do the safety evaluation of cellular immunity in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer treatment explore the clinical strategies for breast cancer immunotherapy.    ,NCT02539017

Breast Cancer,Efficacy and Safety Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Local Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients, The 10%-15% of breast carcinomas known to be 'triple negative (TN)' (not expressing HRs and not exhibiting overexpression Her2) constitutes 85% of all basal-like tumors because it is based on three standard immunohistochemical biomarkers. In clinical routine Docetaxel was widely indicated as first-line therapy for breast cancer patients in adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings. Oxaliplatin trans-1-diaminocyclohexane-platinum may offer advantages over other platinum agents. Oxaliplatin promotes formation of DNA adducts preventing DNA replication and transcription and ultimately causing apoptosis. Oxaliplatin was more potent than cisplatin and the Oxaliplatin-based regimen was active for the patients of lung cancer colorectal cancer and ect. TNBC patients were more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy regimens according to the results of some retrospective studies. There was no report about Oxaliplatin in the chemotherapy setting for breast cancer patients. The investigators hypothesized that using Oxaliplatin adding to docetaxel would be feasible and active in patients with TNLABC because in vitro findings suggest synergism between the agents. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of oxaliplatin-based regimen as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting in triple negative local advanced breast cancer patients    ,NCT01216124

Breast Cancer,A Study of AZD2014 in Combination With Selumetinib in Patients With Advanced Cancers, Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 are two new anti-cancer treatments that AstraZeneca are developing; they are both not yet approved for clinical use. Selumetinib (AZD6244) is a drug that acts by blocking a protein called MEK which has been linked to the development and growth of multiple cancers. AZD2014 is a drug that blocks a protein called mTOR that is involved in the growth and spread of cancer. Blocking the action of either MEK or mTOR alone may slow down or stop the cancer growing. Combining both drugs may make the cancer more sensitive than if Selumetinib (AZD6244) or AZD2014 are used alone and therefore this dual treatment may lead to increased anti-tumour effects. Although Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 given alone and in combination with other anti-cancer drugs have been tested in people with advanced cancer the specific combination of Selumetinib (AZD6244) and AZD2014 has not been used in people before. Therefore Phase 1b (Dose Escalation Phase) will determine what the recommended dose to use in Phase IIa (Dose Expansion Phase) will be. Efficacy progression free survival duration of response and overall survival will then be assessed in patients with triple-negative breast cancer and Non small cell lung cancer within Phase IIa.    ,NCT02583542

Breast Cancer,Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation as Adjuvant Treatment for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients, Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to any breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptor (ER) progesterone receptor (PR) or Her2/neu. Its incidence is approximately 180000 cases per year. TNBC are known to be more aggressive with poor prognosis specially when no pathologic complete response (pCR) is achieved after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a higher risk of recurrence and a poor survival once that recurrence occurs. On the other hand there is not a specific adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment for these patients. Since autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) allows the usage of higher doses of chemotherapy which results in higher cellular destruction with a decrease of hematological toxicity it is proposed that this procedure is able to improve prognosis in TNBC patients with no pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    ,NCT02670109
Breast Cancer,CISPLATIN + AZD-1775 In Breast Cancer, This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for triple-negative breast cancer that has spread to other areas of the body.

Breast Cancer,Addition of Cisplatin to Neoadjuvant Therapy for T Locally Advanced Breast Cancer, The investigators hypotheses that paclitaxel combined with cisplatin in a weekly-based regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is effective and tolerable for locally advanced breast cancer.    ,NCT02199418
Breast Cancer,Weekly Paclitaxel and Cisplatin to Treat Hormone Receptor Positive and Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients, The investigators hypothesize that paclitaxel combined with cisplatin in a weekly-based regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is effective and tolerable for locally advanced breast cancer. In patients with some sub-type advanced breast cancer neo-adjuvant chemotherapy combined with endocrine therapy may improve the pathological remission rate. Premenopausal patients with triple negative breast caner and hormonal receptor positve breast cancer patients will be randominzed to have neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with endocrine therapy or not.    ,NCT02221999
Breast Cancer,Addition of Carboplatin to Neoadjuvant Therapy for Triple-negative and HER2-positive Early Breast Cancer, Study participants with primary breast cancer will receive a standard chemotherapy with an anthracycline and a taxane as well as trastuzumab in case of HER2-positive tumors at doses and duration in concordance to current treatment guidelines. Patients will be receive and benefit in addition currently not in the neoadjuvant setting registered medication as lapatinib or bevacizumab of which significant increases of cure (pCR) rates have been reported in previous phase III studies. Patients randomized to carboplatin will receive in addition to the described backbone therapies a potentially active agent which suggested synergy of efficacy with chemotherapies as well as targeted agents. Patients might have the risk of an increase in toxicities due to the added agents and will have additional burden due to investigations required for study participation. However due to the severity of the underlying disease and the high risk of relapse and death due to the stage of disease this increase in toxicity and burden appears less relevant compared to the potential higher efficacy and finally cure rate by the incorporated treatments.    ,NCT01426880
Breast Cancer,Nanoparticle-based Paclitaxel vs Solvent-based Paclitaxel as Part of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Early Breast Cancer (GeparSepto), Current guidelines as those from the AGO-Breast commission recommend for neoadjuvant breast cancer patients either a sequence of 4 cycles EC followed by 4 cycles of a taxane or 6 cycles of TAC based on previous large scale studies. Treatment of patients with HER2-positive disease should include also simultaneous application of trastuzumab. Solvent-based taxanes (paclitaxel docetaxel) cause severe toxicities not only by the active agents itself but also by the solvents like cremophor. Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) is a solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel encapsulated in albumin. It does not require premedication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to prevent the risk of solvent-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. This new formulation improves safety profile allows higher dosing with shorter infusion duration and produces higher tumor drug concentration. As neoadjuvant treatment does not only allow to compare competing treatment approaches with a very high quality (homogenous treatment population precise assessment of response by histological assessment) but also to identify predictive markers this trial will compare weekly nab-paclitaxel with solvent-based paclitaxel at their currently optimal doses. In case of HER2-positive tumor status patients receive Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab additionally.    ,NCT01583426
Breast Cancer,A Phase III Trial Comparing Two Dose-dense Dose-intensified Approaches (ETC and PM(Cb)) for Neoadjuvant Treatment of Patients With High-risk Early Breast Cancer (GeparOcto), Two regimen are currently considered to have highest efficacy for patients with high-risk early stage breast cancer: sequential treatment of high dose epirubicin taxane and cyclophosphamide concomitantly with a dual HER2-blockade and weekly treatment with paclitaxel/non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin with dual HER2-blockade or carboplatin. The aim of the GeparOcto study is to compare those two regimen/strategies. Both regimens are myelosuppressive with a significant incidence of chemotherapy induced anaemia. The second aim of the GeparOcto study is therefore to compare the use of parental ferric carboxymaltose versus physician's choice for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with iron deficiency.    ,NCT02125344

Breast Cancer,Dual Blockage With Afatinib and Trastuzumab as Neoadjuvant Treatment for Patients With Locally Advanced or Operable Breast Cancer Receiving Taxane-anthracycline Containing Chemotherapy, Anthracycline/taxane based combination chemotherapy of at least 18 weeks represents the standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting. In HER2 positive disease trastuzumab is given simultaneously. Neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy given simul-taneously with trastuzumab achieves a pCR rate of approx. 40%. Recent data showed that a double blockade of the HER2 receptor (e.g. trastuzumab + lapatinib; trastuzumab + pertuzumab) given together with a few cycles of chemotherapy can increase the pCR rate by approximately 20%. So far there is uncertainty if afatinib (BIBW 2992) an irreversible HER family blocker can lead to an even more complete blockade of the HER2 pathway when given in combination with trastuzumab. The neoadjuvant setting provides the unique opportunity to assess precisely and at short term the effect of systemic treatment by assessing the pCR at surgery. It also allows treating patients with HER2 positive breast cancer before surgery without standard trastuzumab treatment as according to current guideline trastuzumab can also be given sequentially after surgery. The aim of the study is to show that chemotherapy + trastuzumab + afatinib can achieve significant pCR rates.    ,NCT01594177
Breast Cancer,Identification of Early Markers of Response and Resistance to Trastuzumab, The study is a single arm prospective study aiming at identifying biomarkers of early response to trastuzumab.

Breast Cancer,The Effect of an Exercise Program in Breast Cancer Patients With Joint Pain While Taking Aromatase Inhibitors., The objective of this study is to determine if patients taking aromatase inhibitors (AI) who are experiencing joint discomfort and stiffness would have reduction in this discomfort and stiffness by participating in a directed exercise program. The overarching objective is to improve patient compliance with the medication and ultimately clinical outcome. In this pilot study we will utilize a scientific approach for proof of concept employing both objective (inflammatory cytokine profiles and Physical Therapy (PT) measurements) and subjective (patient perception) methods to support an evidence based clinical plan. Patients will be divided into two cohorts. Group A will receive AI therapy with a directed exercise program. Group B will receive AI therapy without a directed exercise program. Data will be collected when both cohorts of patients enroll in the study at the end of PT for Group A and at the end of 8 weeks for Group B. At these time points both groups will undergo a PT evaluation; have blood drawn for cytokine profiles; answer questions on an iPad that includes: the Pain Disability Index the PHQ-4 (Psycological Health Questionaire depression scale and pain level scale.    ,NCT02057536
Breast Cancer,BRCA1/2 and Effect of Mifepristone on the Breast, Ovarian steroids as well as their synthetic counterparts gestagens and estrogens have a role in breast cell proliferation and the development of breast cancer. Here the effect of a progesterone receptor modulator mifepristone on cell proliferation in human breast tissue in vivo will be studied in women with BRCA-1 or -2 mutations. Our preliminary results implicate a possible protective effect of mifepristone in breast epithelium. The ability of mifepristone to block breast epithelial cell proliferation may prevent tumorigenesis and may also prove beneficial when used for contraceptive purposes and on other indications. The proposed project concerns a Randomized Controlled Trial on mifepristone versus placebo treatment of women with BRCA-1or -2 mutations with a high risk/incidence of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.    ,NCT01898312
Breast Cancer,A Phase II Study of Dose Density Regimen With Fluorouracil Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide at Days 1 4 Every 14 Days With Filgrastim Support Followed by Weekly Paclitaxel in Women With Primary Breast Cancer., TITLE: A Phase II Study of Dose Density Regimen with Fluorouracil Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide at Days 1 4 Every 14 Days with Filgrastim Support followed by Weekly Paclitaxel in Women with Primary Breast Cancer. PROTOCOL CODE: IRST 174.05 PHASE: II STUDY DESIGN: Pharmacological open-label prospective not randomized monocentric trial DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENT: FEC + filgrastim x 3 cycles q 14-21 days Day 1 and day 4 = FEC (FLUOROURACIL 500 mg/m2 IV infusion of 30 minutes + EPIRUBICIN 60 mg/m2 IV infusion of 1 hour + CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE 500 mg/m2 IV infusion of 30 minutes). From day 7 until hematological recovery = Filgrastim 300 microg s.c. After 21 days from the last FEC cycle = Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 IV infusion of 1hour (weekly for 8 cycles at day 1). NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: in the first stage 11 patients have been planned with an additional 27 patients to the second stage if at least 7 patients complete the planned treatment. OBJECTIVES Primary objective: this trial is designed to assess feasibility of the proposed regimen with regard to toxicity and deliverability. Tolerability is defined as absence of any grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia nausea/vomit and bone pain which might be a consequence of the administration of filgrastim). Deliverability is measured as the percentage of patients who complete the planned treatment. Secondary objectives:   -  Relapse-free survival: measured from enrollment to the first date between date of documented relapse (or death) or date of last tumor assessment (if no documented relapse) or the date of last tumor assessment before the start of any further antitumor therapy not planned in the protocol.   -  Overall survival: measured from enrollment to the date of death of any cause or last follow-up. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES: to evaluate retrospectively potential biomarkers of activity and toxicity of this regimen blood and plasma samples until 15 mL each one will be collected at study entry before first docetaxel administration and 3-4 weeks after last docetaxel administration. Moreover a paraffin block or specimens of the primary tumor will be collected for biological studies. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This trial is designed to assess feasibility of the proposed regimen with regard to toxicity and deliverability. Tolerability is defined as absence of any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia nausea/vomit and bone pain which might be a consequence of the administration of filgrastim). A Simon two-stage design has been used with a 60% tolerability rate considered not promising and an 80% tolerability rate as promising and probability of type I and type II errors has been set to be 0.10. In the first stage 11 patients have been planned with an additional 27 patients to the second stage if at least 7 patients complete the planned treatment. The regimen would be considered tolerable and worthy of further study if at the end of the trial 27 out 38 patients complete the planned treatment.    ,NCT02225652
Breast Cancer,Yoga for Breast Cancer, The purpose of this study is to examine the use of Eischens yoga for 8 weeks in one cohort of 20 women with stage I and II breast cancer receiving radiation therapy treatment while a second cohort of the same type of and number of patients who instead of yoga will receive standard supportive therapy Questionnaire measuring cancer-related quality of life (FACT-G instrument) and fatigue (Brief Fatique Inventory) will be given to patients at several points.    ,NCT01985945
Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer 2-PREVENT Translational Center of Excellence (TCE) - Metastatic Markers of Recurrent Tumor Phenotype for Breast Cancer, This is a cohort study of women with suspected or confirmed recurrent breast cancer with accessible tumor by standard clinical biopsy prior to starting a new therapy for recurrent metastatic disease. Study participants will be ascertained from the population of all persons greater than eighteen years of age receiving care at the clinical practices of the Rowan Breast Center (RBC) at the University of Pennsylvania. The overarching goal of this study is to identify the genetic and molecular markers of molecular evolution identified in patients who have progressed from a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to recurrent metastatic disease. As an observational study this study seeks to gather data regarding the molecular and genetic changes that a primary cancer undergoes as a patient's cancer recurs and ultimately progresses. We anticipate enrolling 50 women with recurrent breast cancer who meet eligibility requirements for this study. Participation in this study will include the following: a biopsy and blood collection completion of the study questionnaire an optional bone marrow aspiration and repeat collection of blood offer of a research biopsy and a optional bone marrow aspirate collection at each progression time point. The study participants' medical information will be updated and changes in disease status will be captured on a regular basis.    ,NCT02530008
Breast Cancer,A Mindfulness Meditation-Based Intervention for Younger Breast Cancer Survivors, Younger women with breast cancer experience substantially greater distress and depressive symptoms than older women. These symptoms can hamper recovery and healthy behaviors that can reduce the risk of recurrence and/or other chronic diseases. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a mindfulness meditation-based intervention for this at-risk group of women. The investigators hypothesize that a structured program of mindfulness meditation will lead to significant improvements in psychological well-being (i.e. depression stress) with corresponding improvements in health behaviors and biomarkers of cancer risk in women diagnosed with breast cancer prior to age 50. The investigators will also examine mechanisms for intervention effects including increased mindfulness and ability to relax.    ,NCT01558258
Breast Cancer,Effect of Preoperative Chemotherapy on Axillary Lymph Node Metastases in Stage II Breast Cancer: A Prospective Randomized Trial, Patients with untreated clinical stage II breast cancer are eligible. An excisional biopsy of the primary tumor is acceptable but without definitive local therapy or prior chemotherapy. Histologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma is required. Patients are prospectively randomized to receive five 21-day cycles of dose-intense (5-fluorouracil adriamycin leucovorin cytoxan granuloctye-colony stimulating factor [FLAC/G-CSF]) chemotherapy either before (preoperative) or after (postoperative) local therapy. Chemotherapy is given as an outpatient. For patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy local therapy (modified radical mastectomy or breast segmentectomy/axillary dissection/breast radiotherapy according to patient preference) is performed 3-4 weeks after last chemotherapy. For patients receiving postoperative chemotherapy chemotherapy will begin 2-3 weeks after local therapy. Immediate reconstruction for mastectomy is acceptable. Upon completion of local therapy and chemotherapy in either treatment group all estrogen receptor positive patients receive tamoxifen for 5 years. Follow-up consists of history and physical examination each 3 months for first 3 years each six months for years 4 and 5 and yearly thereafter. Mammogram bone scan chest x-ray and blood work are performed yearly.    ,NCT00001250
Breast Cancer,Autologous T-Cell Transplantation and the Immunotherapy of Residual Disease in Breast Cancer: Pilot Study of Vaccine-Driven T-Cell Expansion in Patients Treated With Dose-Intensive Chemotherapy, The ability of chemotherapy to cure cancer including breast cancer has been limited by drug resistant residual tumor cells remaining after chemotherapy that generally result in relapse. Additional therapeutic strategies to eradicate these residual tumor cells are needed. The augmentation of specific anti-tumor immune responses such as those mediated by T-cells might represent such an additional strategy for the control or elimination of residual tumor cells. This approach might be especially effective if T-cell mediated responses were enhanced during both the period of T-cell repopulation that follows acute T-cell depletion and in the setting of minimal residual tumor burden present after dose intensive chemotherapy. Such chemotherapy is known to result in severe T-cell depletion. This pilot study has been designed to examine the feasibility of combining dose intensive chemotherapy with interventions aimed at the reconstitution of T-cell immunity. Metastatic or adjuvant breast cancer patients who have received dose intensive chemotherapy will subsequently receive a combination of autologous chemotherapy-naive T-cells a patient-specific tumor antigen vaccine and recombinant human interleukin-2. These interventions will be assessed for their ability to modulate T-cell number T-cell function and T-cell specificity during the period of T-cell repopulation. Such modulation may result in the effective reconstitution of generalized T-cell immunity with the generation of vaccine-specific anti-tumor T-cell responses.    ,NCT00001440
Breast Cancer,Establishment of Normal Breast Epithelial Cell Lines From Patients at High Risk for Breast Cancer, Women who are at high risk for breast cancer either because of linkage to high risk breast and ovarian cancer families or because of a carcinoma in the opposite breast will be studied. Women will have a physical examination and mammography to ensure that no breast abnormalities are present. Eligible women will undergo biopsy of the breast to obtain normal breast tissue. Short-term cell cultures will be established from this tissue and early passages of the short-term cell lines will be stored. A bank of high risk normal mammary epithelial cells will be established. To further characterize the mammary epithelial cells in this population of women cell cultures will subsequently be analyzed for their growth and metabolic properties sensitivity to chemopreventive agents steroid receptor characteristics oncogene expression and regulation and genetic changes.    ,NCT00001496
Breast Cancer,Chemotherapy and Progenitor Cell Transplantation to Treat Inflammatory Breast Cancer, This study will evaluate the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel (Taxol) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) followed by high-dose melphalan and etoposide for treating inflammatory breast cancer. Patients also receive infusions of their own previously collected progenitor cells (primitive cells that can make new cells to replace ones destroyed by chemotherapy). Patients 18 years of age or older with stage IIIB inflammatory breast cancer that has not metastasized (spread beyond the breast) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination blood and urine tests and chest x-ray. They have computed tomography (CT) of the head chest abdomen and pelvis as well as a bone scan to determine the extent of disease and a nuclear medicine scan called MUGA to examine the heart's pumping ability. They may receive a rehabilitation medicine evaluation. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:   -  Central venous line placement: Patients have a central venous line (plastic tube) placed into a major vein in the chest before beginning treatment. The line remains in the body throughout treatment and is used to give chemotherapy and other medications and to withdraw blood samples. The line is usually placed under local anesthesia in the radiology department or the operating room.   -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive two or more cycles of paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide. Paclitaxel is given intravenously (I.V. through a vein) for 72 hours using a portable pump. Cyclophosphamide is given daily for 3 days I.V. over 1 hour. The cycles may be 28 days apart. A drug called Mesna is given with this treatment to protect the bladder from irritation from cyclophosphamide. Patients who have not previously been treated with doxorubicin (Adriamycin) may receive a maximum of four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide by vein on a single day during each cycle with cycles 21 days apart. When all the paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide cycles are completed patients receive melphalan and etoposide both drugs I.V. over 1 to 8 hours for three consecutive days.   -  G-CSF treatment: After each paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide cycle and after the melphalan/etoposide treatment patients are given a drug called G-CSF. G-CSF injected under the skin stimulates production of infection-fighting white blood cells.   -  Apheresis: This is a procedure to collect progenitor cells for later reinfusion. For this procedure blood is collected through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in an arm vein. The blood is circulated through a cell-separating machine where the white cells including the progenitor cells are extracted and the red cells are returned to the patient through another catheter in the other arm. Apheresis is done after each of two cycles of paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide.   -  Progenitor cell transplant: Progenitor cells are reinfused after melphalan/etoposide treatment.   -  Glucose infusion: A salt solution with chemically modified glucose is infused I.V. over a period of from 12 to 48 hours with subsequent donation of blood cells for blood and immune system studies. Patients have a maximum of two glucose infusions separated by at least 3 months.   -  Tumor biopsy: Some patients have a biopsy of their tumor (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue for microscopic study) before starting chemotherapy.   -  Blood tests: Blood is drawn frequently to monitor safety and treatment response and for research purposes.   -  Dental consultation: Some patients may have a dental consultation before the progenitor cell transplant.    ,NCT00001507
Breast Cancer,Microarray Analysis for Human Genetic Disease, This study will look at genetic changes which occur in the development of male and female breast cancer and other cancer. It will use a new technology called DNA microarray hybridization that looks at a wide array of genes to identify disease-associated patterns in the human genome (complete set of human genes). Numerous studies have linked particular genes to a given disease but there is very little information on patterns of gene expression (production of proteins from genetic coding) in the entire human genome. Pinpointing genetic abnormalities in disease may help classify different forms of cancer and perhaps lead to new avenues of treatment or prevention. A primary goal of this study will be to create a database of gene expression for human cancers and other disorders that will provide the basis for finding genetic abnormalities in disease. Tumors specimens used in this study will be taken from tissues biopsied from patients with breast colon cancer sarcomas or melanoma as part of their routine care. Patients in the study will be among those receiving care at the: Department of Oncology University Hospital University of Lund Sweden (breast cancer); Department of Medicine University of Michigan Ann Arbor Michigan (breast cancer); Surgery Branch National Cancer Institute Bethesda Maryland (melanoma) Johns Hopkins Univ. (colon cancer) Memorial Sloan Kettering (sarcoma). Patients in the study will have a family history taken and will complete a questionnaire. Some patients will be asked to have a blood test. Breast cancer patients will have a mammogram if one has not been done within the last year.    ,NCT00001898

Breast Cancer,Yoga to Reduce Cancer Fatigue, A randomized trial from the British National Health Service found that supervised exercise benefits women with early stage breast cancer with improved functional and psychological benefit after a 12-week intervention and 6 months later. Considering the needs of breast cancer patients and survivors and the reported benefits of exercise and yoga intervention the investigators propose a pilot study of an 8-week yoga intervention in breast cancer patients. This study would specifically address measures of fatigue and psychosocial distress in the population of breast cancer patients during treatment and within the year following treatment. Currently there is very limited literature on yoga intervention in this population.    ,NCT00583739
Breast Cancer,Strength Training for Older Breast Cancer Survivors, Women aged 50 and older are disproportionately affected by breast cancer not only in terms of new diagnoses but also in terms of survivorship. Approximately 85% of women who receive a first diagnosis of breast cancer are aged 50 and over thus older women constitute the largest group of breast cancer survivors. Yet few studies have focused on evaluating whether physical activity and exercise interventions affect long-term symptoms physical fitness and function and body composition of older breast cancer survivors. Due to the combined effects of breast cancer related treatments and aging it is likely that exercise is even more beneficial for older breast cancer survivors than for younger survivors. Along with the cancer-related symptom of fatigue common to cancer survivors older survivors face age-related declines in bone and muscle mass muscle strength bone health and physical function (gait and balance) that are likely exacerbated by reduced physical activity in survivorship and side effects of adjuvant cancer treatment. All women regardless of age are at risk for breast cancer recurrence. Recent epidemiologic evidence suggests a link between exercise and reduced risk of cancer recurrence in breast cancer survivors. Strength training is specifically suited to reverse or slow age-related declines in bone muscle strength and function and has shown promise to reduce cancer-related fatigue. However no controlled trials of strength training in older breast cancer survivors have been conducted.    ,NCT00591747

Breast Cancer,Feasibility Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Early Breast Cancer, Most women with early breast cancer are treated with breast conserving therapy (BCT) consisting of breast conserving surgery (surgery to remove the cancer itself) followed by radiation to the breast. This treatment can take time and is associated with its own side effect profile. An innovative radiation technique called stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can deliver large doses of radiation precisely to the tumour while avoiding critical organs therefore destroying the cancer and avoiding surgery altogether. SBRT has been successfully used for a number of cancers and it is proposed that it could be used to eradicate breast cancer. This feasibility study will investigate the feasibility and safety of treatment using SBRT in women with early stage breast cancer. Thirty-two women age 70 years or older with early breast cancer will be treated with SBRT (5 treatments) followed by breast conserving surgery and hormonal therapy. An MRI and breast conserving surgery will be performed at 8-12 weeks after radiation to assess response to treatment. The primary outcome of the study will be feasibility meaning the ability to deliver radiation treatment as planned. Secondary outcomes will include treatment related toxicity and pathological response. If this study shows that SBRT can be used to treat patients primarily it will lead to further evaluation of SBRT for early breast cancer.    ,NCT02065960

In this study the ability of the SAVI SCOUT to guide surgeons to find a lesion will be evaluated instead of the standard technique of wire localization.    ,NCT02370082
Breast Cancer,Comparison of FlexHD and Alloderm Outcomes in Breast Reconstructive Surgery, FlexHD and Alloderm are two common products used in breast reconstruction to hold tissue expanders and implants in place. There have been few chart review studies comparing outcomes between the two materials in breast reconstruction. These studies have determined there is no difference in complication rates between the two materials. However there have never been any active studies to date. This study will serve as a randomized controlled trial comparing FlexHD and Alloderm. Several outcomes will be measured based off of inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine if either product is more suitable for use in breast reconstruction. This will be performed by randomly assigning patients to receive either FlexHD or Alloderm. Designated outcomes will be followed closely postoperatively. Outcomes will be statistically analyzed to determine complication rates between FlexHD and Alloderm and thus which product is better to use in breast reconstruction.    ,NCT02372305
Breast Cancer,Radiofrequency-Guided Localization in Patients With Abnormal Breast Tissue Undergoing Lumpectomy, This pilot clinical trial studies the use of the radiofrequency-guided localization in patients with abnormal breast tissue undergoing lumpectomy (a type of breast-sparing surgery).

Breast Cancer,Sentinel Lymph Node Identification in the Axilla of Women With Breast Cancer Using Ultrasound and Iron Injection, This study evaluates a new method of testing the lymph nodes in the armpit of patients with breast cancer for tumor involvement. All participants involved in this study will undergo an injection of a small amount of iron dissolved in liquid followed by an ultrasound of the axilla that will make previously invisible lymph nodes visible allowing them to be sampled in an outpatient setting.    ,NCT02610920
Breast Cancer,RISAS Procedure in Node Positive Breast Cancer Following NAC, Chemotherapy in clinically node positive breast cancer patients is increasingly administrated in a neoadjuvant setting. The standard treatment regimen in these cases is then: neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by breast surgery and an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). NAC results in axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) in 1 out of 3 patients indicating a complete absence of axillary metastases after completion of NAC. In such events ALND can be regarded as overtreatment that creates unnecessary morbidity. Less invasive axillary surgery which can accurately assess axillary pCR is therefore preferred over standard ALND in all patients. In case of detection of remaining axillary lymph node metastases by this less invasive axillary surgical procedure completion axillary treatment is standard of care. The novel RISAS procedure is introduced as a possible less invasive axillary staging procedure. RISAS procedure contains Radioactive Iodine Seed localisation in the Axilla in axillary node positive breast cancer combined with a Sentinel node procedure. The iodine seed in the axillary lymph node metastasis will be placed prior to start of NAC.    ,NCT02800317
Breast Cancer,Effect of Pectoral Nerve Block on Post-op Pain in Patients Undergoing Mastectomy and Immediate Reconstruction, Patients undergoing total mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction with a tissue expander or implant under general anesthesia will be randomly assigned to the addition of a pectoral nerve block or no regional block. Post-operative pain nausea/vomiting scores will be assessed.    ,NCT02913573
Breast Cancer,Implementation of Provision of Balanced Information on Mammography in Family Practice, To trial the provision of full information on the benefits and risks of mammography in women that are eligible for breast screening. The knowledge many women have of mammography is not reflective of the recent change in evidence; it is often missing information on over-diagnosis and over-detection. Women tend to overestimate their risk of breast cancer and the benefits of breast screening. In addition universal breast screening programs are biased towards emphasizing screening. However a mammogram is not a perfect test and there is no right or wrong decision about whether to have a screening mammogram. It is an individual woman's decision to make. To understand the effect of changing information to reflect the potential for over-diagnosis and over-treatment we will carry out a pragmatic controlled trial of implementation of balanced information on mammography in family practice.    ,NCT02914197

Breast Cancer,Decongestive Exercise and Compression for Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema Management, Women who have undergone breast cancer surgery may develop swelling of the arm on the side the breast cancer occurred. If the swelling becomes chronic it is called lymphedema. This study will examine the effect of a 12-week decongestive progressive resistance exercise with advanced compression on breast cancer related lymphedema. Our objective is to determine if breast cancer survivors are willing and able to wear advanced compression while exercising and if the combination will help to reduce their lymphedema. Twenty-four breast cancer survivors from Edmonton Alberta will be enrolled in the one-year long study.    ,NCT02992782
Breast Cancer,Reduced Contrast Administration in Contrast-enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM), The optimal dose of iodine based contrast agents used in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is unknown. If CESM performed with lower dose of iodine based contrast agent visualizes a tumor comparable to CESM with regular dose of contrast agent patients can receive less contrast agent for CESM in future and thereby risking less side effects of the contrast agent. In order to study whether CESM remains unchanged at smaller amounts of contrast administration a second CESM exam will be performed within one week of the first with a an alternative amount of contrast it being either 80% 60% or 40% of the original contrast dose. The settings of the CESM unit will remain unchanged.    ,NCT03008031

Breast Cancer,The Clinical Significance of Internal Mammary Lymph Node Irradiation in Axillary Lymph Node Positive Breast Cancer Patients, In addition to axillary lymph node (ALN) internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) chain is also the first-echelon nodal drainage site for metastasis and it provides important prognostic information in breast cancer patients. However decision about local treatment of IMLN is still being made based on ALN status. The 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines recommend internal mammary lymph node irradiation for patients with more than 4 positive ALNs (category 1) and strongly consider irradiation for patients with 1 to 3 positive ALNs (category 2A). Therefore there will be patients in positive ALN subgroup who just face complications of an unnecessary radiation to IMLN and there will be patients in negative ALN subgroup who do not receive adjuvant radiation therapy they really need. Thus these inclusion criteria of National Comprehensive Cancer Network might lead to over-treatment and under-treatment. Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) provides a less invasive method of assessing the IMLN than surgical dissection. However low visualization rate of IM-SLN has been a restriction of IM-SLNB. A modified radiotracer injection technique was established in our previous study. This technique could significantly improve the IM-SLN detection rate. The investigators have validated the accurate of the hypothesis and the modified radiotracer injection technique in the previous study. Recently the investigators propose that if IM-SLN is the only metastatic lymph node and there would be no positive node else in IMLN chain the radiotherapy and its associated complications could be avoided in these patients. On the other hand if there is the presence of metastatic non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) in IMLN chain after IM-SLNB it is important to predict the risk of IM-NSLN metastasis in IM-SLN positive patients. As there is currently no such model a predictive model for IM-SLN positive patients to avoid radiotherapy is needed in this situation. Therefore a new study will be conducted to verify the issues above. In the current study all the participants (18~70 years of age) would have the preoperative pathology of invasive breast cancer and positive fine-needle aspiration result in their clinical or ultrasonic suspicious axillary lymph node. 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid was injected into the parenchyma under the ultrasound guidance 3 to 18 hours before surgery. Two syringes of 9.25 to 18.5MBq 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid in 0.5 to 0.7mL volume were injected at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions 0.5 to 1.0 cm from areola (about 2.0~4.0 cm from the nipple). IM-SLNB was performed in all participants with IMSLN visualized on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and/or detected by the intra-operative gamma probe. All hotspots in the internal mammary basin were harvested and intra-operative identification of the IM-SLN was based on gamma probe detection. The IM-SLN was sectioned along the long axis into two blocks and all blocks were tested by the frozen section and the touch imprint cytology intra-operatively. Those participants with positive intra-operative results received IMLN dissection. Finally all the IM-SLN blocks and IM-NSLN dissected were assessed post-operatively by H&E and Cytokeratin 19 stained immunohistochemistry. The conclusion would be drawn through the results mentioned above.    ,NCT03024463

In the control group patients will be treated with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.    ,NCT03011060
Breast Cancer,iNPWT in Immediate Breast Reconstruction, Due to the Danish breast cancer-screening programme and the increased use of genetic counselling Danish women are being diagnosed with breast cancer or a high lifetime risk of developing breast cancer at a younger age than previously. An increasing proportion of these women pursue an immediate breast reconstruction where the breast is removed and reconstructed in a single surgical procedure. As some of these women will need to undergo adjuvant cancer therapy after their breast surgery fast recovery is essential in order for the adjuvant therapy not to be delayed. With the development of new surgical techniques the complication rate to the immediate breast reconstructions has improved. However wound-healing issues remain one of the most common complications to the surgery with the possibility of delaying the adjuvant therapy and diminish the aesthetic result. Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) is a new approach for surgical site closure. Recently iNPWT has shown promising results in lowering post-operative complications including wound-healing issues in other surgical settings. However iNPWT has still not been studied in an immediate breast reconstructive setting. The current randomized controlled clinical study will investigate if an iNPWT system is able to provide women seeking an immediate breast reconstruction with faster healing and superior aesthetic results compared to the conventional post-operative wound dressings used today. The investigators plan to include 60 women randomized in a 1:1 ratio between iNPWT or conventional wound dressing. The primary outcome measure is the time until removal of the surgical drains which corresponds to the healing progression. Secondarily complications to the surgery assessment of the scar (measured using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale) and patient reported satisfaction with the reconstruction (assessed using the BREAST-Q questionnaire) will be performed. Included patients are examined pre-operatively and at the routine controls at four weeks and four months post operatively. The results from the current study will elucidate if iNPWT aids wound healing after immediate breast reconstruction which would lead to fewer patients experiencing delays before their adjuvant therapy. Furthermore the results from the aesthetic satisfaction will elucidate if iNPWT provides the patients with a better self-reported aesthetic result.    ,NCT03069885
Breast Cancer,Neoadjuvant Weekly Paclitaxel and Biomarkers of Therapy Response, The hypothesis of this study is that paclitaxel levels increase chromosomal instability (CIN) in tumors and this is lethal to tumors that have pre-existing CIN. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Paclitaxel will be initiated as standard infusions on days 1 8 and 15 of a 1-day cycle. Participants will continue with paclitaxel for cycles 2-4 prior to surgery.    ,NCT03096418
Breast Cancer,Effectiveness of Nefopam in Breast Cancer Surgery, Breast cancer surgery is known to cause severe acute postoperative pain which can persist for a long time.

Breast Cancer,A Multimodality Treatment Approach to Patients With Inflammatory Cancer of the Breast and Locally Advanced Non-Inflammatory Stage III Breast Cancer and Stage IV Breast Cancer, This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of high dose melphalan and autologous bone marrow transplantation given as consolidation therapy to patients with inflammatory or metastatic carcinoma of the breast in complete remission. All patients entered will receive induction therapy with cyclophosphamide adriamycin methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil with hormonal synchronization utilizing tamoxifen and premarin as in a previous Medicine Branch protocol (MB-160C). Among patients with inflammatory carcinoma of the breast pathologic complete responders will receive irradiation to the breast and regional lymph nodes; convertible partial responders and clinical complete responders with residual disease on biopsy will undergo surgical resection of bulk disease followed by irradiation of the chest wall and regional lymph nodes excluding the axilla. Both groups of responders will be randomized to receive either systemic consolidation therapy with high dose melphalan (180 mg/M2 total dose over 3 days) and autologous bone marrow transplantation followed by maintenance therapy or maintenance therapy alone. Complete responders in this noninflammatory group will not receive further therapy since historically they have done well following induction and local therapy with maintenance therapy alone. Patients with metastatic breast cancer will be assessed for response throughout induction therapy. Complete and convertable partial responders will receive consolidative therapy and be randomized to ABMT followed by 6 months of maintenance therapy vs. maintenance alone.    ,NCT00001193

The initial goal of this study was to define the toxicity of interleukin-1 administered for 7 days prior to ICE chemotherapy. A total of 22 patients have been treated with IL-1 and ICE and results showed a more rapid engraftment (4.5 days) with IL-1. A second cohort of 18 patients also received G-CSF and engraftment was further shortened in some subgroups. Overall the median time to engraftment was 16 days with both IL-1 and G-CSF. Accrual will continue to further define the toxicity and efficacy of this regimen.    ,NCT00001270
Breast Cancer,A Prospective Randomized Phase III Trial of FLAC (5-Fluorouracil Leucovorin Adriamycin Cytoxan) Chemotherapy With GM-CSF (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor) Versus PIXY 321 in Advanced Breast Cancer, This is a prospective randomized Phase III trial of FLAC chemotherapy with GM-CSF versus PIXY321 in advanced breast cancer. The primary endpoints of this study will be the duration of thrombocytopenia and the time to recovery of platelets to 50000/microliters. Other clinical endpoints will include the depth and duration of leukopenia neutropenia and anemia the platelet and RBC transfusion requirements and the number of documented instances of sepsis and hospitalizations for fever and neutropenia. Laboratory correlates will include the detailed evaluation of the effects on circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells by GM-CSF and PIXY321 and the potential effects these agents have on the bone marrow micro-environment. After 5 cycles of FLAC with GM-CSF versus PIXY321 patients will be treated with 5 cycles of 96 hour infusional taxol. The goal of this part of the study will be to assess the toxicity and feasibility of administering infusional taxol following dose-intensive FLAC chemotherapy.    ,NCT00001338
Breast Cancer,Positron Emission Tomography in Patients With Breast Cancer, This is a prospective study evaluating the role of Positron Emission Tomography (PET scan) in breast cancer. The radiopharmaceutical [18F] 2-deoxyglucose will be used as both an imaging modality and to evaluate tumor metabolism in patients with breast cancer. Patients with stage II stage IIIA or IIIB or stage IV breast cancer and evaluable disease in the breast and/or at metastatic sites will be studied. Patients will be injected intravenously with [18F]2-deoxyglucose and a PET scan conducted over 90 minutes. Examination of the role of PET scan in assessing the response of breast cancer to chemotherapy especially in stage II and stage III patients will be done. Up to three PET scans within one year may be performed. Findings by PET scan will be correlated both with those of concurrent imaging techniques (x-ray CT scan MRI bone scan or mammogram) and with histologic biochemical and flow cytometric information on the tumor and with findings in subsequent surgical specimens. Changes in tumor glucose metabolism with treatment will be assessed by PET imaging studies and by biochemical methods when possible.    ,NCT00001385
Breast Cancer,Outcomes of Education and Counseling for BRCA1 Testing, This study will identify how personal beliefs values and family experiences affect a person's decision as to whether or not to be tested for changes in a gene called BRCA1 or BRCA2. Changes in these genes are associated with a significantly increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer in women a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer in men and a slightly higher risk of colon cancer in both men and women. Families enrolled in the National Cancer Institute's familial cancer research project who also participated in a telephone survey (protocol 78-C-0039) regarding their level of interest in BRCA1/2 testing results may be eligible for this study. All participants will complete a 20- to 30-minute questionnaire assessing knowledge risk perception and personality traits and will participate in an education session to review the following:   -  Information about their individual cancer risk based on family history   -  Potential benefits and risks (medical psychological and social) of BRCA1/2 testing both for those who test positive and those who test negative   -  Overview of DNA testing (what is done and how accurate it may or may not be)   -  Medical management options for those at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer   -  Environmental cancer risk factors   -  Instruction in breast self-examination Participants will then be asked whether or not they want to undergo BRCA1/2 testing Those who want to be tested will be divided into two groups to compare counseling methods (client-centered vs. counselor-driven counseling). A small blood sample (2 to 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for genetic analysis. Test results will be provided in person at a second visit-this may take 6 months or more. A follow-up telephone call 2 weeks after receipt of the test results will address participants' questions and provide support. During a third visit scheduled 6 months after receipt of the test results participants will complete questionnaires evaluating mood attitude self-esteem family interactions cancer screening practices and other factors. Finally 1 year after receipt of the test results participants will be contacted by telephone and asked about their feelings about the test and its outcome. Individuals who choose not to have gene testing will not participate in any in-person sessions after the initial visit. They will be followed with no more than two telephone interviews to assess their feelings and attitudes related to their decision not to be tested. Individuals may reconsider and change their mind at any time regarding their decision-whether to be tested or not. The results of the study will help experts devise the most effective methods of educating and counseling people at high risk for having an altered BRCA1/2 gene.    ,NCT00001468
Breast Cancer,Antimetabolite Induction High-Dose Alkylating Agent Consolidation and Retroviral Transduction of the MDR1 Gene Into Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cells Followed by Intensification Therapy With Sequential Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin for Stage 4 Breast Cancer, This study examines the feasibility of using gene therapy to prevent some of the toxicities of an intensive chemotherapy regimen in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients who do not wish to participate in the gene therapy procedures will be offered identical chemotherapy on a different protocol. Patients will be treated initially with chemotherapy which is active against breast cancer but which has a low potential to hurt blood-forming cells. Then the patient will receive high dose chemotherapy during which time blood cells which are capable of rebuilding patients' bone marrows will be removed from the patients' bloodstream. We will use these blood cell collections to isolate peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) those cells which are thought to be the forbears of all other blood cells. A portion of the PBPCs will be exposed to a disabled virus which either carries genetic material referred to as the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1). The virus will transfer the MDR1 gene into a portion of the patient's PBPCs. The purpose of putting the MDR1 gene into the patients' PBPCs is to try to make these blood cells and their offspring resistant to the toxic effects of certain types of breast cancer chemotherapy. The MDR1 protein (Pgp) that is made from the MDR1 gene makes cells resistant to chemotherapy in laboratory systems by pumping the drug out of cells before the drug is able to kill the cell. Another portion of the patients PBPCs will be exposed to a similar disabled virus carrying a different gene called the NeoR gene. The NeoR gene should not change the effects of chemotherapy on blood forming cells. The purpose of using the NeoR gene is that it will serve as a point of comparison to see if the presence of the MDR1 drug resistance gene really helps blood forming cells withstand subsequent chemotherapy. Patients are then treated with a very high dose of another anti-breast cancer drug one that is very toxic to bone marrow cells and patients will then receive the frozen PBPCs which contain the new genes to help them recover from the chemotherapy. After recovery patients will then be treated with high doses of paclitaxel (Taxol) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin) chemotherapy. Both of these drugs are very active against breast cancer and the MDR1 gene may potentially protect bone marrow cells against these drugs. Samples of peripheral blood cells will be obtained before each of these doses of chemotherapy to determine whether the number of blood cells that contain the MDR1 gene in comparison to the number that contain the NeoR gene has increased in response to the chemotherapy.    ,NCT00001493

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of BAY59-8862 in Taxane-Resistant Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients, Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women in developing countries accounting for approximately one-fifth of all female cancers in the United States. Although mortality rates are declining in some countries it remains the leading cause of death in women aged 40-55 years. The median survival for women with metastatic breast cancer is 2-3 years but there is significant variability in this population. The primary goals of treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer are improvement or maintenance of quality of life and prolongation of survival. The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel were incorporated into the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the 1990's. The usefulness of the taxanes is limited by the development of tumor resistance to these agents. This phase II trial with BAY59-8862 will be conducted to determine the anti-tumor efficacy of BAY59-8862 in taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT00044525

Post-menopausal women on aromatase inhibitors or Faslodex® alone and pre-menopausal women on aromatase inhibitors plus luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LH/RH)-agonist may be eligible to be enrolled. Patients must not have had radiotherapy or major surgery within four (4) weeks prior to entering the study. Information about the safety and tolerability of administration of the THERATOPE® vaccine will also be gathered during the course of the study.    ,NCT00046371
Breast Cancer,ABI-007 in Taxol Resistant Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, The anticancer agent paclitaxel (marketed as Taxol) has shown remarkable activity against metastatic breast cancer. However the Taxol formulation requires prolonged administration times and there are safety problems that have been attributed to the solvent rather than the active ingredient paclitaxel. This is a new formulation of paclitaxel that has been found to have fewer safety problems than Taxol and may be administered safely at higher doses. This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of this new formulation of paclitaxel given intravenously once a week for three weeks followed by a rest week. This cycle will be repeated until safety problems or treatment failure require that the patient stop therapy.    ,NCT00046514
Breast Cancer,Study of ABI-007 and Taxol in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, Paclitaxel (Taxol Bristol-Meyers Squibb) has been shown to be very effective against metastatic breast cancer as well as other cancers. Because the Taxol formulation of paclitaxel is dissolved in Cremophor an organic solvent containing castor oil and ethanol prolonged intravenous administration times are required; and because the solvent has caused hypersensitivity reactions a premedication schedule is required. ABI-007 is a new anticancer medication containing the same active ingredient as Taxol paclitaxel but formulated as a protein-stabilized material that is suspended in salt water and administered intravenously. The time of administration is reduced the dose of paclitaxel can be higher than is safe for Taxol and there is no premedication required. This study will determine the efficacy of this new formulation of paclitaxel as compared to Taxol for patients with metastatic breast cancer. This is an open label comparative study so patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the Taxol or ABI-007 forms of paclitaxel but will know what medication they are receiving. Treatment will be repeated every three weeks unless adverse events or treatment failure require discontinuing study medication.    ,NCT00046527
Breast Cancer,Phase II Study to Evaluate Tariquidar (XR9576) a Selective MDR-1 Inhibitor in Chemotherapy Resistant Advanced Breast Cancer, The primary objective of this phase II study is to assess if XR9576 a selective MDR-1 inhibitor is able to reverse primary doxorubicin or taxane resistance in advanced breast cancer. Clinical activity will be measured by objective tumor response rates observed after treatment with XR9576 in combination with taxane or anthracycline containing chemotherapy in patients previously resistant to the same agent(s). The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the biological activity of XR9576 and evaluate MDR-1 expression in these tumors. The MDR-1 inhibitory activity of XR9576 will be evaluated by serial sestamibi scans of the tumor. MDR-1 expression will be detected by immunohistochemistry.    ,NCT00048633
Breast Cancer,Vaccine and Chemotherapy for Previously Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer, This study will evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy and a combination of vaccines to treat metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast) in patients whose cancer cells have a protein called carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) on their surface. Patients who require surgery or radiation therapy or both will receive these treatments as well. Patients 18 years of age and older with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer may be eligible for this study. Newly diagnosed patients may not have received prior chemotherapy. Patients previously diagnosed with local disease may have received chemotherapy or radiation therapy at least 18 months before entering the current study. Patients may have received hormonal therapy for stage IV disease. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination blood and urine tests x-rays heart and lung tests and a test to determine the presence of CEA on their tumor cells. Participants undergo the following procedures:   1. Central venous line: Under local or general anesthesia an intravenous catheter (plastic tube) is inserted into a major vein in the chest. It is used to give chemotherapy and other medications and to withdraw blood samples.   2. Apheresis: Before beginning treatment and at various times before and after chemotherapy patients undergo apheresis to collect white blood cells for later re-infusion at the time of immunizations and to evaluate the body's response to the vaccines. For this procedure blood is collected through the central venous catheter and circulated through a machine that separates the white cells from the rest of the blood. The white cells are removed and frozen for later use. The rest of the blood is returned to the patient through the catheter.   3. First vaccine: Before starting chemotherapy patients receive one subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of a vaccine called rV-CEA-Tricom along with subcutaneous injections of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Sargramostim) a drug that stimulates the bone marrow to release white blood cells and white cell precursors into the bloodstream.   4. Chemotherapy:   -  Taxol (paclitaxel)/Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide): Patients receive three to five cycles of Taxol and Cytoxan. Taxol is given as a continuous 72-hour intravenous (intravenous (IV) through a vein) infusion and Cytoxan is given daily for 3 days intravenously over 1 hour. Cycles are 21 to 42 (usually 28) days. After each cycle patients also receive growth colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (a drug that helps boost white cells.    ,NCT00048893

The study will also analyze how fast investigational drug and its breakdown products are cleared from the blood in these patients.    ,NCT00067314
Breast Cancer,Use of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Assess Tumor-Associated Vasculature in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, This study will examine a non-invasive method to assess vasculature that is the development of a blood supply necessary to the growth of tumors. The hope is to identify the way that genes are expressed within the tumor itself from areas shown as low flow versus those shown as high flow on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Most patients with solid epithelial cancers those that develop on free surfaces or linings inside the body die because of the distant spread of tumors-metastasis. After that spread a cure is more difficult than if the tumors were detected early or locally. Tumors develop a new supply of blood. Traditional anticancer therapies have had the goal of causing a decline in the tumor. Yet by focusing on the tumor's blood supply microscopic differences between tumors and clonal differences within tumors may be avoided. Doing so may overcome tumor resistance to treatment and may result in treatments that can be more universally applied across tumor types. Female patients 18 years of age enrolled in the protocol Analysis of Brain Metastasis in Patients with Breast Cancer with and without Over-Expression of HER-2 who will undergo an MRI scan immediately before surgery will be invited to participate in this study. Patients seen in the oncology outpatient clinic of the NIH Clinical Center or by referral from outside physicians may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo DCE-MRI immediately before the craniotomy-the surgery scheduled-in conjunction with other clinically indicated MRI. The preoperative MRI will take about 30 minutes and the DCE-MRI will take no more than 15 minutes. During the MRI patients will lie still on a table that can slide in and out of a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. They may be asked to lie still for up to 5 minutes at a time. As the scanner takes pictures there will be loud knocking noises and the patients will wear earplugs to muffle the sound. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan and may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. During part of the MRI patients will receive a contrast agent one that is gadolinium-based into a vein. This agent changes the relative brightness or contrast on the MRI image under some conditions. Before that agent is used patients will be asked about any previous allergic reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents.    ,NCT00071357
Breast Cancer,Analysis of Brain Metastasis in Patients With Breast Cancer With and Without Over-Expression of HER-2, This study will examine two subsets of patients with breast cancer metastasis that is spreading to the brain. It will identify genes and proteins that promote metastasis particularly in women who are found to over-express (have more than other people do) the human epidermal growth factor receptor ErbB2 also known as HER-2. The molecular and genetic events that permit tumor metastasis are not well understood. There is intense investigation going on into the process in which tumor cells escape the primary local tumor spread to distant places in the body and find and create conditions that promote growth in those tissues. Metastasis of tumors such as breast cancer to the brain is a common problem. Tumor cells will be analyzed with the use of microarrays. A microarray is a tool for analyzing gene expression consisting of a small membrane or glass slide containing samples of many genes arranged in a regular pattern. The goal is to identify a potential molecular signature. It is hoped that there will be discovery of why some patients are more likely than others to develop a brain metastasis which can have a major negative effect on the quality of life and survival. Female patients 18 years of age with known or evidence by radiology of a breast tumor metastatic to the brain or those who have had a removal of a brain tumor for diagnosis or treatment may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo the following procedures and tests:   -  Craniotomy that is surgical opening of the skull and removal of the brain tumor.   -  Blood specimens taken from a central vein or artery before the operation throughout as needed and for several days afterward to measure blood chemistries blood count and so forth.   -  Physical examination and imaging of the central nervous system before and after surgery.   -  Urine or serum or both pregnancy test of women of childbearing potential. Patients will also undergo blood tests at 3-month intervals after surgery for up to 5 years. The purpose is to determine if there are tumor cells in the blood which may explain how they reached the brain.    ,NCT00071383
Breast Cancer,Irinotecan in Patients With Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Experienced Failure of an Anthracycline a Taxane and Capecitabine, The purpose of this phase II randomized open-label clinical trial is to study 2 schedules of single-agent Irinotecan in women with metastatic breast cancer who have experienced failure of prior therapy with an anthracycline a taxane and capecitabine. Patients will receive Irinotecan capsules either once each day for 5 days or once a day for 14 days in 3 week cycles.    ,NCT00072852
Breast Cancer,Exemestane and Celecoxib in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk for Breast Cancer, The primary goal of this 5-year study is to determine whether exemestane alone or in combination with celecoxib decreases breast tissue density in healthy postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer. Dense breast tissue seen on mammography has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. The study will also examine the effects of exemestane and celecoxib on bone density blood hormone levels and quality of life. Exemestane approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating postmenopausal women with breast cancer lowers the amount of estrogen in the body. Celecoxib approved for treating arthritis pain and for reducing the number or colon polyps in an inherited syndrome is an anti-inflammatory drug. Half of the women in the study will receive exemestane alone and half will receive exemestane and celecoxib together. In December 2004 the arm using exemestane and celecoxib was closed to accrual Postmenopausal women who are at increased risk for developing invasive breast cancer may be eligible to participate. Candidates are screened with breast cancer risk assessment medical history and physical examination blood tests review of medical records if needed breast biopsy and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to assess bone density. For the DEXA scan the subject lies still on a table for about 30 minutes while the spine and hip are scanned using a small amount of radiation. Participants take exemestane in pill form once a day for 2 years. They also take calcium and vitamin D pills daily to help protect bone health. They are followed in the clinic during the course of the study to determine the amount of drug taken and any side effects and for the following tests and procedures:   -  Medical evaluation and blood tests at after 1 and 3 months on study drugs   -  Medical evaluation at 6 months   -  Breast biopsy at screening and then at 12 months   -  dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of the spine mammogram and routine blood tests before starting study drugs and then yearly for 5 years.    ,NCT00073073

Breast Cancer,Stem Cell Transplant With Th2/Tc2 Cells to Treat Advanced Breast Cancer," This Phase 1 trial will investigate the safety of a modified stem cell transplant procedure for treating advanced breast cancer. Patients with cancers can sometimes benefit greatly from transplants of stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into blood cells). In addition to producing new bone marrow and restoring normal blood production and immunity the donated cells fight any residual tumor cells that might have remained in the body in what is called a ""graft-versus-tumor"" effect. However severe problems or sometimes even death may follow these transplants as a result of the high-dose chemotherapy and radiation that accompany the procedure. Also donated immune cells called lymphocytes or T cells sometimes attack healthy tissues in a reaction called graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) damaging organs such as the liver intestines and skin. This study will use the following strategies to try to reduce these risks:   -  ""Induction chemotherapy"" to reduce patients' immunity in an attempt to prevent rejection of the donated stem cells   -  Reduced-intensity conditioning chemotherapy that is easier for the body to tolerate and involves a shorter period of complete immune suppression   -  Removal of lymphocytes from the donor stem cells for transfusion in small quantities at monthly intervals following the stem cell transplant to reduce the risk of GVHD   -  Transplant of specific lymphocytes called Th2/Tc2 cells that may increase the percentage of donor stem cells accepted by the patient without significantly increasing GVHD Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with advanced (stage IV) breast cancer that does not respond to standard therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history physical and dental examinations x-ray studies and bone marrow biopsies to evaluate disease status blood and urine tests (including a blood test for genetic match with the donor) and lung and heart function tests. Participants have a central venous line (large plastic tube) placed into a major vein. This tube stays in the body during the entire treatment period for infusing the donated stem cells and T lymphocytes giving medications including chemotherapy and other drugs antibiotics and blood transfusions and withdrawing blood samples. Treatment starts with induction chemotherapy in which patients receive one or two cycles of the anti-cancer drugs fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. (One cycle consists of 4 days on drug therapy followed by a 17-day rest period.) G-CSF a drug that boosts white cell production is also given to reduce the risk of infection. Several days before the transplant procedure patients begin conditioning chemotherapy with higher doses of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Three days after the conditioning therapy is completed the stem cells are infused. To help prevent both rejection of the donor stem cells and GVHD patients receive cyclosporine (first by vein and later by mouth) for several weeks after the transplant. Infusions of donor lymphocytes begin about 6 weeks after the transplant to boost the immune system and enhance the graft-versus-tumor effect. Patients may leave the hospital when they are able to eat and drink have no fever or infection and have a normal or near-normal white cell count. They return for follow-up visits twice a week for the first 100 days after the transplant then every 3 months then 6 months and then yearly for at least 5 years post-transplant. The visits include a medical history physical examination and blood draws as well as disease staging with CT scans every month for the first 6 months.    ",NCT00079625

Breast Cancer,Exercise in Women at Risk for Breast Cancer," This 2-part study will examine how much exercise people usually do in the course of their daily lives and how two different types of exercise-stretching and walking-affect the amount of fat in the body and certain hormones in the blood. It will also examine whether exercise can be increased by physician counseling with and without the use of a pedometer and if exercising changes levels of stress anxiety and depression. Breast cancer survivors and women at high risk for breast cancer who are between 18 and 75 years of age and who exercise less than 3 times per week may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination and their endurance and flexibility are tested by stretching exercises and by a 6-minute walk or run. All participants complete study Part 1. Those who are eligible may also participate in Part 2.   -  Part 1: Subjects wear a pedometer (a small device that measures the number of steps taken) on their waistband during all waking hours for 1 week without changing their usual level of activity. Depending on their level of activity subjects may be invited to participate in Part 2 of the study.   -  Part 2: Subjects are placed in either a walking group or a stretching group for 12 weeks. At the end of the 12-week period those in the walking group are offered participation in the stretching group and those in the stretching group are offered participation in the walking group. Walking group participants wear a pedometer every day for 12 weeks. They are asked to gradually increase the number of steps they take each day to keep a record of their daily step count and to report periodically to the study staff on their progress. For 1 week during the study participants also wear a device called an accelerometer that is used to verify the accuracy of the pedometer step counts. Stretching group participants follow a program of stretching exercises for 12 weeks with their progress monitored periodically by staff. During week 12 participants wear a pedometer and accelerometer. All Part 2 participants also have the following tests and procedures:   -  Blood draw: collected at the beginning and end of the study to test for certain hormones and HDL cholesterol levels.   -  Questionnaires: about stress anxiety and depression levels; these are completed at the beginning and end of the study and a detailed questionnaire about diet is completed at home or during a clinic visit.   -  Body composition measurement: A ""bioelectrical impedance"" test which measures body fat is done at the beginning and end of the study. For this test the subject lies on an examining table and a small electrical current is passed through electrodes placed on one hand and one foot. Although a small electrical current is used this test is not painful.   -  Endurance and flexibility testing: At the end of the study participants repeat the 6-minute walk or run endurance test and the stretching flexibility test performed at screening.

Breast Cancer,Study of Fluorodeoxyglucose (FluGlucoScan) in Patients With Breast Cancer: Correlation With Histologic Findings of Sentinel Node Biopsies and Axillary Dissection, Breast cancer affects many women. One of the places to which it can spread is the lymph glands under the arm. The type of treatment offered to patients often will depend on whether those lymph glands have cancer in them or not. For this reason a standard recommendation is that women with breast cancer have these lymph glands removed with surgery. This cancer causes side effects including numbness pain decreased ability to move the arm and arm swelling. A new type of surgery which looks only at the first gland that a cancer drains to (sentinel node biopsy) may help to avoid having to remove the glands under the arm. Also a new way of imaging the glands under the arm called Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning may also give a better idea of the chance that these glands have cancer in them. This study is determining whether PET scans before surgery and sentinel node biopsy can decrease the need for a complete axillary dissection.    ,NCT00123799

Breast Cancer,RCT of a Group Intervention for Women With a Family History of Breast Cancer, One in 10 Canadian women will be diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) and approximately 5% of all BC is believed to be hereditary. Women with a family history experience high levels of perceived risk for developing BC. Elevated risk perceptions for BC have been associated with psychological distress which in turn can interfere with screening adherence. In our completed CBCRI-funded study we developed and standardized a group intervention designed to address the psychological issues associated with having a family history of BC. Results demonstrated that the intervention led to significant improvement in levels of anxiety and depression improved BC risk factors/genetics knowledge and was associated with optimal screening behavior. The proposed study will rigorously test the group intervention in comparison to standard risk counselling in a sample of 150 women recruited from Familial BC clinics in Toronto. The interventions will be examined for their impact on a) psychological functioning b) BC risk/genetic knowledge and c) screening behaviors.    ,NCT00150917

Breast Cancer,Administration of Autologous Dendritic Cells (DCs) Infected With an Adenovirus Expressing Her-2," We the researchers at Hamilton Health Sciences have developed a novel approach to cancer therapy using transfected dendritic cells (DCs) to generate enhanced immunity to defined tumor antigens. Dendritic cells are highly specialized antigen presenting cells found in the bone marrow lymph nodes skin and thymus. Infection of DCs with Adenovirus (Ad) vectors incorporating genes for defined tumor antigens enables intracellular expression and major histocompatability complex (MHC)-restricted presentation of tumor peptides by transfected DCs. Given the potent immunostimulatory properties of DCs and ability to use gene transfer to ""load"" DCs with tumor antigen we hypothesize that administration of transduced autologous DCs may have potential therapeutic benefit as a cancer vaccine. We have examined Ad-tumor antigen DC based vaccination in murine models of breast cancer and melanoma. In both models injection(s) of Ad-transduced DCs results in highly potent immune activation and antigen-specific anti-tumor responses. In these models high levels of antigen-specific cytotoxic effector lymphocytes that recognize and kill cancer cells directly correlates with a therapeutic response (tumor regression and/or complete protection of animals subsequently re-challenged with tumor cells). Animals demonstrating specific in vitro immunity are protected against subsequent injection of cancer cells. Moreover we have observed complete resolution and significant long-term survival in animals with established metastatic disease with no demonstrable toxicity. As opposed to vaccination protocols with tumor peptides or purified epitopes that are MHC-I restricted (i.e. HLA-A2) we have found that injection of DCs transduced with a vector expressing the entire tumor antigen results in peptide presentation from both MHC-I and MHC-II complexes. The subsequent immune response is comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Thus Ad-based gene transfer of tumor antigens appears to be an efficient approach: (1) enabling sustained endogenous peptide processing and (2) facilitating DC-specific presentation to the host immune system. We have shown that using a replication deficient adenovirus vector expressing Her-2/neu DNA under the control of a human mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter that we can transfect bone marrow derived DCs (AdHer2/DC). These cells are then used to immunize recipient mice against tumour challenge with Her2 transgenic tumour cells. The protection is antigen specific (anti Her2). On the basis of these pre-clinical studies we will initiate a pilot trial of the AdHer2/DC vaccine in Her -2/neu overexpressing patients with metastatic breast cancer. Long-term goals and implications of possible results: The goals of this initial pilot phase I study are to evaluate the safety and dosing schedule of the vaccine therapy. The vaccine will be tested in subsequent phase II and III studies to determine efficacy in comparison to standard therapies. The long-term goals are to eventually test this therapy in the adjuvant breast cancer setting in Her-2/neu overexpressing patients.    ",NCT00197522

The role of cytotoxicity during the period of breast surgery itself and immediately after (perioperative chemotherapy) remained unknown. We investigated in a randomized trial the role of perioperative chemotherapy in patients treated with a preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer and compare it to the preoperative chemotherapy without additional cytotoxic therapy during and immediately after definitive surgery. Patients with T2-3 N0-2 M0 breast cancer with both estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PgR) expressed in less than 20% of tumor cells or with absence of progesterone receptors received up to 6 courses of primary systemic therapy with epirubicin 25 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) on days 1 and 2 cisplatin 60 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and 5-fluorouracil 200 mg/m2 i.v. daily as continuous infusion (ECF).

Breast Cancer,Does a Single Steroid Injection Reduce the Formation of Postmastectomy Seroma, Background Seroma formation is a common problem after mastectomy. The incidence various between 30% to 92%. It is often an ongoing problem after removal of the suction drain and repeated skin puncture is necessary to remove the seroma. In addition to many ambulatory visits this also leads to an increased risk of infection and the adjuvant treatment can be delayed for several weeks Different procedures have been tried to avoid seroma formation. Among these are for ex. : immobilisation of the arm and shoulder after mastectomy different drain regimens closing of the dead space of the cavity different chemical substances as thrombin tranexamacid and fibrin. Non of these results has been successful. Seroma formation is most likely the result of the inflammatory response due to wound healing. In the seroma fluid several factors have been detected that support this assumption. These factors are: high levels of IgG leucocytes granulocytes proteinases proteinases inhibitors different kinds of cytokines ( tPA uPA uPAR PAI-1 PAI-2 IL-6 og IL-1??. On the basis of this an inhibition of the inflammatory response might result in a decrease of seroma formation and perhaps improve quality of life after mastectomy. Steroids inhibit the inflammatory response for example by inhibition of the cytokine function. It has been shown that a high single dose of steroid infusion (30mg/kg solu-medrol) inhibits the normal IL 6 response after colon resection. Newer studies have shown that even at a lower dose the inflammatory response is inhibited. In several studies of head and neck surgery the oedema in surgical area is reduced after a single dose of 125 mg solumedrol. It is precisely this effect of reduced fluid formation we want to obtain in our study. We have therefore chosen to use a single dose of 125 mg of solumedrol in this study. Even at the largest single dose of glucocorticoids there have not been seen any increasing in surgical complications. The aim of the study: To find out whether single dose of glucocorticoid can reduce the seroma formation after mastectomy Study design : A randomised pilot study with 2 x 20 patients. 125 mg solumedrol is given 15 hours before surgery in 20 patients and the other 20 patients are the control group Inclusion criteria: Women with primary breast cancer undergoing a mastectomy with either sentinel node biopsy or complete axillary dissection.    ,NCT00307606
Breast Cancer,Involvement of Endogenous Digitalis-like Compounds in Breast Cancer, The endogenous digitalis-like compounds (DLC)are steroid hormones synthesized and released from the adrenal gland.They are integrated in the feed-back system of the Hypothalami-Pituitary-Adrenal gland axis.One of their remarkable function is to induce apoptosis in malignant cells. Recently accumulating data point to the possibility of using synthetic DLC as new anti-cancer drugs. Less is known about the endogenous metabolism of these compounds in cancer patients. Proceeding from preliminary clinical data which demonstrated significantly reduced DLC plasma levels in breast cancer patients and from in vitro data which showed an impaired release of DLC towards stress stimuli in athymic nude micewe put up the hypothesis that a latent adrenal insufficiency with low DLC levels facilitates the induction and progression of tumor diseases.    ,NCT00310882

Healthy volunteers will be asked to provide a blood sample at time of enrollment but will not be followed.    ,NCT00355316
Breast Cancer,Evaluating Patient Information Prescriptions, Research shows that patient satisfaction with medical care correlates strongly with how satisfied they are with the ease of getting information from their providers regarding their medical condition. Although the Internet is a wonderful source of information for patients research has shown that unmediated it comprises a potential quagmire of information poorly matched to users needs. Providers typically do not have enough time to fulfill all of their patients' information needs. One strategy to meeting the patient's information needs is to introduce librarians trained and experienced in consumer health information services into the relationship between the patient and the provider. One recently described tactic is for providers to provide information the way they of provide treatment-through an information prescription (IRx) filled by a librarian. The librarian fills the prescription by offering information services tailored to the needs of individual patients. At Johns Hopkins we have piloted such a tactic and in this project extend and evaluate it. The research hypothesis is that provision of an IRx will improve patient satisfaction provider knowledge and attitudes regarding patient information needs and the efficiencies of care.    ,NCT00355381

Breast Cancer,Testing of Different Methods for Determining Whether Breast Cancer Has Spread to the Lymph Nodes, Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has recently emerged as a less invasive alternative to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in the treatment of breast cancer. However SLNB has a number of limitations and we believe that alternative strategies for staging of the axilla should be explored. The hypothesis of this proposal is that the combination of preoperative high-resolution axillary ultrasound (AUS) fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and molecular analysis using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) represents a viable minimally invasive alternative to SLNB. We propose a prospective cohort study to rigorously assess the diagnostic accuracy of molecular analysis of AUS-FNAB specimens. The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the feasibility of AUS-FNAB and real-time RT-PCR to predict the pathologic status of the axilla in a proof-of-principle study. In the short term validation of this innovative strategy is likely to reduce the number of sentinel node procedures. In the long term we believe that AUS-FNAB may ultimately replace SLNB.    ,NCT00360152

Breast Cancer,The Influence of Breast Cancer Risk and Risk Perception on Lifestyle Behaviors Among Women With a Family History: A Mixed Method Approach," Lifestyle behaviors among women with a family history of breast cancer are likely to be influenced by a number of factors including both objective risk factors and subjective risk or perceived risk. The aims of this mixed method study are twofold and will be explored through both quantitative (i.e. secondary survey data) and qualitative data (i.e. personal in-depth interviews) derived from the Sister Study a large epidemiologic study being conducted through the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences which is addressing risk factors for breast cancer in sisters of women who have had breast cancer. The quantitative aims include an exploration of lifestyle behaviors and behavioral differences between White and African American women as well as well as an exploration of the relationships between lifestyle behaviors (i.e. varying levels of objective risk based on Gail model risk scores medical risk-reducing factors (i.e. use of Tamoxifen or Raloxifene and/or prophylactic surgery) as well as additional factors that may be contributors to perceived risk. This aim will be addressed using data that have already been collected as part of the baseline activities for the Sister Study. The primary qualitative aim is to gain a better understanding about perceived risk and the relationship between perceived risk and lifestyle behaviors in both White and African American women with a family history of breast cancer. This aim requires the collection of new data through in-person interviews with between 28 and 40 women depending on how many interviews are required to achieve ""data saturation."" The mixed method approach will be based on a ""complementarity"" model which emphasizes the use of two different methods to address different aspects of the research problem. Results from both methods will become integrated into the discussion of the findings and it is expected that this approach will enrich the study and allow for elaboration of the quantitative results. The secondary data analysis will be derived from approximately 10000 women initially enrolled in the Sister Study who are between the ages of 35 and 74 and have had at least one sister affected by breast cancer. Women for the qualitative interviews will be recruited from a cohort of Sister Study participants residing within North Carolina and will include equal numbers of both White and African American women. It is expected that 28 women will be needed for qualitative data saturati...    ",NCT00393406

Breast Cancer,German Preoperative Adriamycin Docetaxel Study, The primary objective of this trial is to determine the rate of pathologically complete remissions following a preoperative dose-intensified therapy with doxorubicin and docetaxel with or without tamoxifen in patients with operable carcinoma of the breast. Secondary aims are to assess the rate of clinical complete and partial responses of breast-conserving operations and the toxicity of chemotherapy with and without tamoxifen. Women meeting the following criteria will be eligible for the study: operable breast cancer (T³3cm N0-2 M0) histologically confirmed diagnosis by core-cut needle or incisional biopsy and measurable disease by mammography or sonography or breast MRI (best appropriate method has to chosen by investigator). After the patients have given written informed consent they will be randomised to the study treatments. All patients are scheduled to receive 4 cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin 50 mg/m² (15-min i.v. infusion) and docetaxel 75 mg/m² (1-h i.v. infusion). The patients allocated to group I additionally receive oral doses of tamoxifen 30 mg once daily starting on the first day of chemotherapy while chemotherapy alone is administered to patients of group II. Cycles should be repeated every 14 days followed by surgery 8 weeks after initiation of the trial. Surgery consists of removal of the remaining tumour (breastconserving resection or mastectomy) and axillary dissection. Patients with no response or even progression of the primary tumour can be treated to the discretion of the investigator but should be followed up according to protocol. If a partial or complete tumour response has been achieved radiotherapy is given to the remaining breast in patients undergoing breast conserving therapy and tamoxifen treatment is continued for a further 5 years. Response will be assessed between the 4th cycle and surgery using the best appropriate method. Clinical evaluation should be performed after each cycle. It is planned to recruite 200 patients during a period of 1 year.    ,NCT00543829

Breast Cancer,Inflammatory Breast Cancer Tumor Markers and Factors Associated With Angiogenesis, This study conducted by the NCI and the George Washington University Medical Center (GWUMC) will examine breast tissue from patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) for tumor markers and factors associated with angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels that is essential for tumor growth and spread. IBC is an extremely rare aggressive form of breast cancer that disproportionately affects young women. The risk factors for IBC its cause and how it develops are unknown but the disease appears to involve a high degree of angiogenesis. Tissue specimens for this study will be obtained from GWUMC's Inflammatory Breast Cancer Registry and Biospecimen Repository. The registry was established to develop a national registry of patients with IBC that includes standardized clinical epidemiological and pathological information along with disease recurrence and survival data. For this study tissue specimens from the repository will be tested for biological markers and angiogenesis parameters to help in the classification of the tumors. Biological markers (such as estrogen receptor progesterone receptor the p53 gene and others) and angiogenesis parameters (such as various proteins involved in vessel formation) will be examined to determine their prevalence in tissue specimens and their relationship to patient survival. When possible the findings will be compared with non-IBC tissue samples.    ,NCT00646555

Breast Cancer,Effects of Rapid Genetic Counseling and Testing in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients, 5-10% of breast cancer patients carry a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Genetic counseling and DNA testing are usually offered to selected patients after primary treatment has been completed (e.g. the first year after diagnosis). For women with a mutation in one of the two breast-ovarian cancer syndrome genes chances of a second breast cancer are high and therefore a proportion of these women may opt for preventive measures in addition to their immediate breast cancer treatment. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy significantly reduces this risk and is associated with a reduction in mortality. Genetic counseling and testing for breast cancer typically takes approximately 4-6 months to complete. However some hospitals and laboratories are now able to generate test results within 3 to 6 weeks. This technology of rapid genetic testing creates new opportunities for providing both women and their treating surgeons with information potentially relevant for deciding between available treatment options including type of surgery and adjuvant therapy. The study will focus on newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who prior to receiving treatment are identified as having at least a 10% risk of carrying a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. We will investigate whether women with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer make use of rapid genetic counseling when offered. Furthermore we will investigate whether the process of genetic counseling (and subsequent DNA testing) has influence on the choice of treatment and whether and how such rapid genetic counseling and testing (RGCT) affects levels of risk perception cancer-related worries and distress and decisional satisfaction.    ,NCT00783822

Breast Cancer,A Pilot Trial of Itraconazole Pharmacokinetics in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer, Cancer cells need to be able to make new blood vessels in order to keep growing. This is called angiogenesis. In a laboratory setting the drug itraconazole was shown to help stop the growth of new blood vessels (anti-angiogenesis). It is hoped that itraconazole will prevent new blood vessels from forming in humans too. The purpose of this study is to look at how the body processes and breaks down itraconazole (called pharmacokinetics). This study will also measure markers in your blood to see if itraconazole stops new blood vessels from forming. The safety of itraconazole will also be tested to see what effects (good and bad) it has on you and your breast cancer.    ,NCT00798135

Breast Cancer,Cardiotoxicity of Adjuvant Trastuzumab, Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) increases the chances of cure in patients with Her-2 overexpressing early breast cancer. Unfortunately both the chemotherapy drugs used in this setting (anthracyclines) and trastuzumab are known to cause cardiac dysfunction in a proportion of patients. Patients who develop heart problems when taking trastuzumab might have to stop this treatment which could jeopardise their chances of cure. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) is a cardiac biomarker that is measured in the blood the levels of which have been shown to indicate the presence of heart failure. Some early research has suggested that there may be a correlation between elevated NT pro-BNP and heart damage due to cancer chemotherapy and also trastuzumab. Troponin is another substance measured in the blood that can indicate heart damage. Finally certain variations in an individual's genetic makeup (called polymorphisms) could put them at increased risk of heart damage from trastuzumab. Here we are studying whether any of these factors (NT pro-BNP levels troponin levels or certain genetic polymorphisms) can accurately predict who is at highest risk of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of NT pro-BNP as a predictive biomarker for the development of trastuzumab related cardiotoxicity (TRC). The investigators will also examine if single nucleotide polymorphisms in the HER2 gene or Fc-gamma-receptor genes predict for TRC.    ,NCT00858039

Breast Cancer,Calcitriol Physical Activity and Bone Health in Cancer Survivors, Both the calcitriol and exercise interventions are aimed at reducing fracture risk by maintaining proper bone density thereby preventing osteoporotic/osteopenic conditions and increasing muscle mass. Both calcitriol and exercise are efficacious in maintaining proper bone health and muscle mass among the general population but little research has been done on breast cancer patients and survivors. The combination of calcitriol and exercise which function through different but similar mechanisms could produce interactive effects in reducing fracture risk among breast cancer survivors. Hypothesis: A combination of calcitriol along with a structured home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program will be efficacious in preventing bone resorption and in increasing bone formation among survivors of invasive breast cancer. Primary Objective To collect data on the efficacy and feasibility of a supplementation of calcitriol with/without an accompanying structured home-based walking/progressive resistance exercise program for improving bone health among breast cancer survivors. Secondary Objectives To collect data on the efficacy and feasibility of a supplementation of calcitriol with/without an accompanying structured home-based walking/progressive resistance exercise program for increasing strength among breast cancer survivors.

Breast Cancer,Positron Emission Mammography With Fluorothymidine (FLT) to Evaluate Treatment Response to Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer, Positron Emission Tomography Imaging with 3-Deoxy-3'-[18F]Fluorothymidine (FLT) can selectively identify proliferating and non-proliferating tissues including tumors. FLT uptake in the tumor is an indirect marker of DNA synthesis activity which is a target of chemotherapy. Our hypothesis is that early change in FLT uptake in tumor with chemotherapy will predict pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. Tumor uptake of FLT will be imaged and measured with positron emission mammography (PEM) a PET scanner optimized for breast imaging with a significantly improved resolution compared to conventional whole-body PET imaging systems.    ,NCT00934401

Breast Cancer,Evaluating and Comparing Two Surgical Methods for Treatment of Early Stage Breast Cancer, The goal of this study is to compare two different types of breast surgery. In the first type the doctor removes only the tumor. In the second type the doctor removes the tumor and some of the tissue around the tumor called margins. The amount of breast tissue removed is similar. The removal of the tumor only has up to 40% chance of reoperation because the tumor is too close to the margin. The primary goal of this study is to see if the additional margins can decrease the need to return to the operating room. Both types of surgery are well accepted and participating in the study would not give you a better chance to cure the cancer. At present most breast surgeons remove the tumor without the additional margins. For all patients who have this operation there is a high incidence of return to the operating room for margins re-excision: as many as 40% as patients can have a re-operation. At present we do not know if taking the additional margins prevents the cancer from returning in the breast or not. If the cancer comes back in your breast this is a recurrence and your breast will have to be removed (mastectomy).    ,NCT01271738

Breast Cancer,Tolerability of the Combination of Lapatinib and Trastuzumab in Adults Age 60 or Older With HER2 Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer, This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well lapatinib ditosylate and trastuzumab work in treating older patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or to other parts of the body (metastatic). Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or tumor cancer-killing substances to them. Giving lapatinib ditosylate together with trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells.    ,NCT01273610

Breast Cancer,Persistent Pain After Breast Cancer Treatment With Docetaxel, Breast cancer treatment is for many patients followed by sequelae such as persistent pain sensory disturbances lymphedema and reduced physical function. These undesired consequences of the treatment are a major clinical problem with persistent pain affecting 25-60% sensory disturbances 20-80% lymphedema 2-86% and reduced physical function 13-28% of patients. Development of persistent pain after breast cancer treatment involves a complex pathophysiology that involves pre- intra- and postoperative factors. Several risk factors for the development of persistent pain after breast cancer treatment have been identified; young age psychosocial factors surgical procedure and radiation therapy.

Breast Cancer,The Use of Botulinum Toxin A in Two-Stage Tissue Expander/ Implant Breast Reconstruction, Breast reconstruction is a common procedure with over 86000 breast reconstruction procedures performed in the United States in 2009. This is a 1.5-fold increase since 2007. Of these breast reconstructions 65% use a tissue expander/implant technique. Although satisfactory results can be achieved with a single-stage technique a two-stage approach is considered more reliable allowing for precise positioning of the inframammary fold and an opportune time to perform a capsulotomy to increase the breast skin flap by releasing the soft tissue. The placement of the tissue expander and implant under the chest muscles is thought to minimize the incidence of capsular contracture expander exposure and in addition produce acceptable aesthetic results. However discomfort is often associated with this submuscular placement of a tissue expander or implant specifically during the expansion phase. Patients undergoing immediate reconstruction using submuscular implants have been shown to have higher analgesic requirements and to have higher pain scores post-operatively compared to non-reconstructed patients. An uncomfortable reconstruction can lead to under-filling of the expander a longer expansion process abandonment of reconstruction and a compromised quality of life. The use of Botulinum Toxin A (Botox) injections into the chest muscles at the time of surgery may help ease the discomfort that is often associated with this procedure. The investigators propose a prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of patients undergoing tissue expander/implant reconstruction. The information gathered from this analysis will provide a greater understanding of the effects of Botox in the setting of two-stage tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction with the goal to improve patient satisfaction and quality of life.    ,NCT01427400

This study is being offered to patients with a diagnosis of advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have failed anthracycline based therapy. The investigators want to see the response of breast cancer cell when treated with Chloroquine used in combination with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is an anti-cancer drug that is given through your vein. The chemotherapy used in this study is either Taxane (Paclitaxel) or Taxane-like drugs (Abraxane Ixabepilone or Docetaxel).    ,NCT01446016
Breast Cancer,Decision Support for Women With Breast Cancer, Breast cancer is a common malignancy among women in the United States. There are a variety of treatment decisions that need to be made. This study has been developed after a review of the literature demonstrated that women with breast cancer are making decisions regarding complex therapy issues in a way that is not congruent with their decision-making control preference. Some patients want to be empowered with information so that they can actively participate in the decision making about their care; others want to rely on the recommendations made by the oncologist. This is important because patients who were not satisfied with their adjuvant treatment decision noted a negative effect on quality of life and self image. These patients had more difficulties with treatment side effects; including aches hot flashes pain and mood alteration. In additions the Institute of Medicine recommended that patient centeredness be a key aim of health care organizations and that all patients be given the opportunity to exercise the degree of control they choose over health care decisions that affect them. It is hypothesized that women making decisions regarding adjuvant therapy who are supported to make decisions based on their preferred level of control will have positive psychological outcomes.    ,NCT01447771
Breast Cancer,Intestine Bacteria and Breast Cancer Risk, Background: - Some bacteria found in the large and small intestines help keep people healthy and aid digestion. They may also affect a person s risk of developing cancer. Researchers want to study the relationship between intestinal bacteria and breast cancer risk factors. They can do this by looking at stool and urine samples from postmenopausal women. Objectives: - To study intestinal bacteria and its relationship to urine-based markers of breast cancer risk in women. Eligibility: - Women between 55 and 69 years of age with a recent mammogram that showed no signs of cancer. Design:   -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and basic health questionnaire.   -  At home participants will complete questionnaires about cancer risk factors and food consumption.   -  Participants will also collect urine and stool samples. They will send the samples to the designated labs for study.   -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.    ,NCT01461070
Breast Cancer,Trial of Eribulin Followed by Doxorubicin & Cyclophosphamide for Her2-negative Locally Advanced Breast Cancer, Previous studies have shown that chemotherapy has the same effect on treating breast cancer whether you receive it before or after surgery. Receiving chemotherapy before surgery rather than after surgery may allow the patient to have less extensive surgery. The purpose of this study is to identify new treatment regimens with better response rates and to find out if the combination of eribulin followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide can shrink the size of the patient's breast tumor and allow you to preserve your breast. Additionally by receiving chemotherapy before surgery the investigators will be able to determine if your cancer is responsive to chemotherapy.    ,NCT01498588
Breast Cancer,GCC 0901 - Study of How Well Letrozole Works in Combination With Lapatinib Followed by an Addition of Everolimus in Postmenopausal Women With Advanced Endocrine Resistant Breast Cancer," About a third of patients with breast cancer are usually treated by hormone pills called tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase inhibitors are drugs that stop female hormone production. Female hormone or estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast cancer cells. Letrozole is one of the aromatase inhibitors that is approved by the FDA and has been used to treat breast cancer since 1997. However hormone pills usually work for about 6-10 months in most patients. Later on breast cancer will start to grow again. This condition when hormone pills or endocrine therapy no longer work is called ""endocrine resistant"" breast cancer. The scientists here at University of Maryland have discovered how these cancer cells can become resistant to hormone pills. In our laboratory tests the investigators found that lapatinib and everolimus can reverse this resistance and make letrozole work again. However it is not known if the drugs can reverse the resistance in humans. The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of letrozole lapatinib and everolimus is effective in women with breast cancer when hormone pills no longer work. Lapatinib is an anti-cancer drug that is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is the standard of care for the treatment of a particular type of breast cancer called human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. HER2 is a protein involved in the growth of some cancer cells. This study will also include patients with HER2-negative breast cancer. This means that the cancer cells in these patients do not depend on the HER2 protein. The use of lapatinib in these patients is considered experimental. Everolimus is also an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the FDA for kidney cancer. Initial studies in mice and later studies in women with breast cancer have shown that everolimus may also slow the growth of breast cancer. The use of everolimus is experimental in this study.

Breast Cancer,Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Versus Digital Mammography: A National Multicenter Trial, The goal of this study is to determine the value of the new mammography technique called Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) compared to the current standard technique Digital Mammography for the early detection of Breast Cancer. DBT is able to compute a three-dimensional image of a breast from several low-dose mammographies taken from different angles while the device is moving around the breast in a circular motion. This should overcome a significant limitation of Digital Mammography arising from the masking of breast cancer in a mammography image caused by overlying normal breast tissue. This is a study conducted in several Austrian Breast Imaging Centers.    ,NCT01524029
Breast Cancer,Photography or Video in Assessing Breast Reconstruction?, Current qualitative methods of assessing the aesthetic result following breast reconstruction are known to be poor.

Breast Cancer,Night-time Compression Systems for Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema, Women who have undergone breast cancer surgery may develop swelling of the arm on the side the breast cancer occurred. If the swelling becomes chronic it is called lymphedema. This study will examine night-time compression system garments for lymphedema. Our objective is to determine if breast cancer survivors are willing and able to use the garment overnight to help control their lymphedema. Thirty breast cancer survivors from Alberta will be enrolled in the 24-week long study. Measurements will be taken of each arm to assess the extent of lymphedema and to measure changes over the study period. We will also examine other outcomes such as the impact of the night-time compression system garment on sleep. The study will provide important information on the feasibility of night-time compression system garments as a self-management strategy for lymphedema.    ,NCT01550250

Participants will receive pertuzumab intravenously (IV) and trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV plus a taxane in cycles of 3 weeks each until predefined study end unacceptable toxicity withdrawal of consent disease progression or death whichever occurs first.    ,NCT01572038
Breast Cancer,The Ultrasound Study of Tamoxifen, Background: - Studies have shown that changes in breast density (the amount of white area on a woman's mammogram) may be related to changes in breast cancer risk. Currently there is no ideal way to measure breast density repeatedly over time. Researchers want to test whether ultrasound tomography scans can show changes in breast density. To examine these changes healthy volunteers with no history of breast cancer and women who are taking tamoxifen will have ultrasound tomography scans. Objectives: - To test whether ultrasound tomography scans can show changes in breast density related to tamoxifen exposure. Eligibility: - Women between 30 and 70 years of age who are (a) taking tamoxifen or (b) healthy volunteers who have never had breast cancer. Design:   -  All participants will have a screening visit. Healthy volunteers will have one additional study visit; women taking tamoxifen will have three additional study visits.   -  All participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also give blood and saliva samples. This visit will also include an initial ultrasound tomography breast scan.   -  For the healthy volunteers:   -  At the study visit (12 months after the screening visit) participants will have a short interview and be weighed. They will also have an ultrasound tomography breast scan and provide a blood sample.   -  For the women taking tamoxifen:   -  At the second and third visits (1 to 3 months and 3 to 6 months after starting tamoxifen) participants will have a short interview. They will also be weighed and have an ultrasound tomography breast scan.   -  At the fourth visit (12 months after starting tamoxifen) participants will have a short interview weight measurement and the ultrasound tomography breast scan and will also provide a blood sample.   -  All participants may be followed for up to 5 years after their final study visit.    ,NCT01582074

Breast Cancer,A Study to Assess the Ability of a Novel Endocrine Treatment for Breast Cancer Irosustat to Slow Down Cancer Growth, This study is investigating the effects of a new hormone treatment for breast cancer called Irosustat. Seventy percent of breast cancers in post-menopausal wome rely on oestrogen to grow therefore are likely to respond to hormone therapy. Irosustat blocks a different pathway of steroid synthesis to Aromatase reducing in this way oestrogen levels in the body. As less oestrogen reaches the breast cancer it grows more slowly or stops growing altogether. IPET will recruit postmenopausal women with early hormone sensitive treatment naive breast cancer will receive 40mg of Irosustat once daily for 2 weeks. The effects of Irosustat on breast cancer will be evaluated by PET scans (Positron Emission Tomography) using a radioactive substance called FLT as a tracer. The scans will be performed in a PET-CT scanner which combines a PET scan and a CT scan (Computer Tomography) into one scan. This type of scan can show how body tissues are working as well as what they look like. FLT-PET scans will be performed before and following treatment with Irosustat. As cancer cells grow faster than the normal cells around them they will take up more of the radioactive substance and so stand out clearly on the scan. If Irosustat is slowing down the cancer growth the cancer will take up less of the tracer. Blood samples will be taken at regular intervals to assess what the new drug does to the body and the safety and tolerability of Irosustat will be assessed. The study incorporates translation aspects/endpoints which are based on the collection of tumour biopsies before and after treatment with Irosustat although the later biopsy is not mandatory.    ,NCT01662726
Breast Cancer,Aromatase Inhibitor Host Factors Study, The purpose of this study is to examine how key patient factors including body size affect how well letrozole suppresses circulating estrogen levels. This study has two components: (1) Part A - an observational phase to evaluate the impact of vitamin D and obesity on estrogen suppression in post-menopausal women already receiving letrozole treatment and (2) Part B - an interventional phase for women with body mass index (BM) > 25 kg/m2. If BMI or other patient factors reduce the effectiveness of letrozole modifications to treatment recommendations and studies to test higher dosing of letrozole may be needed to maximize the benefit of this treatment and minimize the risk of the breast cancer coming back.    ,NCT01669343

Breast Cancer,Iyengar Yoga for Chemotherapy-induced Fatigue in Breast Cancer Patients, Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women and is associated with profound restrictions of health-related quality of life and psychosocial health. More than three-quarters of women with breast cancer suffer from fatigue during cancer treatment. While exercise interventions can improve fatigue in breast cancer patients many patients request complementary treatment approaches. Therefore this study investigates the effects of yoga in women with breast cancer compared to aerobic exercise and usual care. It is hypothesized that yoga is more effective than usual care and equally effective as aerobic exercise.    ,NCT01686737
Breast Cancer,Randomized Controlled Phase II Trial of Pre-operative Celecoxib Treatment in Breast Cancer, Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is frequently over-expressed in primary breast cancer. There is evidence that COX-2 inhibition exerts anti-tumor effects in breast cancer. To further determine the effect of COX-2 inhibition in primary breast cancer we aimed at studying the changes in breast cancer tissues of patients treated with the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. In a single-centre double-blinded phase II study breast cancer patients were randomised to receive either pre-operative celecoxib (400 mg) or placebo twice daily for two to three weeks. We collected fresh-frozen pre-surgical biopsies (before treatment) and surgical excision specimens (after treatment) to assess the tumor changes by use a cDNA microarray which allows to study the genome-wide changes at the transcriptional level.    ,NCT01695226

Breast Cancer,Comparison Study of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy by Multimodal Method in Breast Cancer, Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become a mainstay surgery method in breast cancer. It provides the surgeon the evidence of axillary lymph node metastasis which determines the extent of surgery. Because effective SLNB can decrease the extent of axillary lymph node dissection it is increasingly important. In general radioactive colloid has been used for SLNB. In order to pursue more precise SLNB the investigators developed a multimodal method enabling visual guidance with the mixture of indocyanine green blue dye and radioisotope. In this study our hypotheses are as following:   1. Multimodal method enables to increase identification rate of SLNB   2. blue dye and indocyanine green provide the surgeon visual guidance to ensure better outcome   3. Multimodal method alleviates the shortcomings of indocyanine green and blue dye as an identification strategy    ,NCT01856452

Breast Cancer,A Pharmacodynamic Study of Sirolimus and Metformin in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors, Given the role of mTOR signaling and probable synergistic activity of combining sirolimus and metformin in patients with advanced solid tumors the investigators hypothesize that:   1. The combination of metformin plus sirolimus will result in reduction of p4EBP1 p70S6K and pAKT more than sirolimus alone in peripheral blood T cells (PBTC).   2. The combination of metformin plus sirolimus will result in decreased levels of serum biomarkers including fasting insulin C-peptide glucose triglycerides LDH IGF-1 IGF-1R IGF-BP and leptin but an increase in adiponectin in peripheral blood.   3. Expression of active forms of AMPK mTOR PI3K PTEN loss AKT LKB1 P62 LC3 and/or ULK1 in the tumor tissue (original pathology) will be predictive of response to combination therapy. This will be an exploratory hypothesis for this study.   4. Sirolimus induced toxicity especially hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia will be mitigated by combining sirolimus with metformin.   5. Metformin plus sirolimus will have promising anti-cancer activity and this activity will correlate with decreases in the above biomarkers.

Breast Cancer,Post-Treatment Surveillance in Breast Cancer: Bringing CER to the Alliance, Nearly three million living women have survived breast cancer. Physicians rely on clinical practice guidelines to make decisions on follow-up care. Among other things the goal is to monitor for recurrence or side effects of treatment among survivors. It is unclear whether these guidelines represent the best approach for any given patient as they do not account for differences in disease or patient preferences and may not consider recent advances in imaging and treatment options. We seek to develop a new approach to surveillance following breast cancer treatment which will be more patient-centered and effective than the existing one-size-fits-all approach and will consider individual risk factors.    ,NCT02171078

Breast Cancer,Ambulatory SNP Under Local Anaesthesia in a Subgroup of Breast Cancer Patients - Trial, Rationale: In breast cancer (BC) patients lymph node status is a key prognostic indicator. At present axillary ultrasound (US) with subsequent fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of suspicious lymph nodes (US+FNAC) is widely used as a pre-operative staging method. When US+FNAC is negative a sentinel node procedure (SNP) is performed during breast surgery. Nowadays an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is generally performed if one of the abovementioned diagnostic entities reveals lymph node metastases. However the extensive role of ALND in BC patients with lymph node metastases may change or diminish in upcoming years due to emerging evidence that completion ALND (cALND) does not affect disease-free survival and overall survival in early BC patients with (sentinel) node-positive disease. Whether ALND is needed in these patients should be based on (axillary) tumour load. Because of the fact that tumour load can only be reliably evaluated by SNP and not by US+FNAC the role of SNP might become even more important in upcoming years. Ideally the status of this sentinel lymph node is known prior to breast surgery so a patient tailored treatment plan can be made and discussed with the patient before breast surgery. In this context it would be very logical to perform a SNP under local anaesthesia (LA) prior to breast surgery. This might not only lead to significantly less two-step surgical procedures under general anaesthesia (GA) but might also lead to a reduction of depressive symptoms and anxiety and improved quality of life (QoL) of BC patients because BC patients are in particular risk for psychological distress in the first three months after diagnosis of BC. Knowing lymph node status and the complete treatment plan as soon as possible (by performing a SNP under LA) might reduce this psychological distress. To investigate which BC patients would benefit most from SNP under LA the investigators recently analysed 1132 BC patients retrospectively. Both prevalence of axillary lymph node metastases and prevalence of false negative results of US+FNAC were directly associated with age <60 years and with primary breast tumour size >20 mm. Hence these BC patients might benefit most from SNP under LA. In the present study the value of SNP under LA in these BC patients (i.e. <60 years with a breast carcinoma >20 mm) will be analysed. Objectives: Reduction of the mean number of operations under general anaesthesia per patient. Improvement of QoL. Reduction of depressive symptoms and experienced anxiety. Study design: Prospective single centre randomised controlled clinical trial. Study population: Women aged 18 to 60 years who are diagnosed with BC AND with a tumour size of >20 mm ultrasonographically AND with a negative or inconclusive pre-operative US+FNAC. Intervention: Sentinel Node Procedure under Local Anaesthesia (SNP under LA) Control: Traditional Sentinel Node Procedure under General Anaesthesia (SNP under GA) Main study parameters: Primary outcome parameters are the number of operations under GA per patient and the number of operations under LA per patient. Secondary outcome parameters are QoL experienced depressive symptoms and anxiety. Timeline and statistics: The inclusion period will be conducted from the 1st of July 2014 to the 1st of August 2015 and 80 patients will be enrolled in this study (alpha 0.05; power 0.8). Inclusion of 80 patients will be sufficient to reduce the number of two-stage surgical procedures under general anaesthesia with 30%. Data will be analysed using descriptive statistics Chi-squared test Fisher's exact test Mann-Whitney U test Kruskall-Wallis test students t-test ANOVA paired t-test Wilcoxon signed-rank test Friedman test Pearson's and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and finally logistic and linear regression analysis.    ,NCT02187718

Breast Cancer,Omitting Sentinel Node Procedure in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Breast Conserving Therapy, STUDY AIM To decrease the number of breast cancer patients receiving over treatment of the axilla in order to positively influence the axillary morbidity rate and quality of life. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine whether omitting the sentinel lymph node procedure is not inferior to the current axillary staging regimen in clinically node negative breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving therapy in terms of regional recurrence rate. HYPOTHESIS The sentinel lymph node procedure can be safely omitted in clinically node negative breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving therapy. This will lead to a decreased axillary morbidity rate with a non-inferior regional recurrence- distant-disease free- and overall survival rates.    ,NCT02271828
Breast Cancer,Preoperative Relaxation Training and Acupuncture to Minimize Perioperative Symptoms in Breast Cancer Patients, Breast cancer surgery is associated with presurgical psychological distress and clinically significant side effects including postsurgical pain nausea and fatigue. A few studies have examined how to intervene to assist women undergoing breast cancer surgery. For example presurgical hypnosis has been proven to decrease side effects and even intraoperative anesthesia use. Besides the more psychologically based interventions there are a few studies suggesting positive effects of acupuncture on pain anxiety and nausea in surgery patients.This study aims to investigate whether a presurgical relaxation training acupuncture treatment or a combination of both therapies is able to reduce presurgical psychological distress an postsurgical side effects in breast cancer patients in comparison to usual care.    ,NCT02276404
Breast Cancer,Study Assessing The Interest of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging With Radioisotope Method For Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Breast Cancer, The sentinel node has a fundamental role in the management of early breast cancer. Currently the double detection of blue and radioisotope is recommended. A radioactive material requires the presence of a nuclear medicine department and the approval of health authorities. In many centers this technique is not available. The use of blue is easier to implement technique. However allergic reactions and prolonged breast tattoo led many teams to stop the practice. So in common practice many center use a single method. However with a single detection the risk of false negatives and the identification failure rate increased to a significant extent and the number of sentinel lymph node detected and removed is not enough. Under these conditions find another method of detection seems crucial. According to the literature the fluorescence method (ICG) is a technique that seems safe and reliable. The investigators therefore propose a prospective randomized study to investigate the interest of fluorescence associated with the isotopic method.    ,NCT02279108
Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Cryoprotection Induced Nail Toxicity Docetaxel Low Cumulative Dose, For the specific patient population studied receiving 5-Fluorouracil epirubicin and cyclophosphamide - Docetaxel sequence (cumulative dose <300 mg / m2) using a cryoprotection has never been assessed. The effectiveness of cryoprotection of onycholysis secondary to Docetaxel is not well established in this population (breast cancer in the adjuvant setting) and is based solely on a publication (Scotté) that does not contain the same therapeutic modalities (dose significantly higher). The few studies available have heterogeneous populations nonrandomized retrospective or with a small sample. By extension to what has been observed with higher cumulative doses of docetaxel some teams offer mittens and booties chilled to their patients a practice that is not the subject of a national consensus. The investigators wish to accurately assess the effectiveness of mittens and slippers chilled their tolerance and their observance because of weak data on this specific population in the literature.    ,NCT02283983

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Myocardial Changes During BReast Adenocarcinoma Therapy to Detect Cardiotoxicity Earlier With MRI, Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst Canadian women. 15-20% of early breast cancers have high levels of a protein called HER2 which is associated with worse survival. Treatment of these patients with anthracyclines followed by trastuzumab (which targets HER2) improves survival. Unfortunately these medications together can cause heart muscle injury resulting in heart dysfunction or failure in about 14% and 3.6% of the patients respectively. Once heart failure (HF) occurs about 60% of patients will not live past 2 years. Studies have suggested that patients with heart injury caused by anthracyclines may be more likely to develop HF with addition of trastuzumab. Therefore tests to find early heart injury after anthracyclines may allow doctors to start heart protective medications with the hope of preventing HF. Also animal and small patient studies have shown that an increase in the water levels of the heart muscle (edema) may be an early sign of heart injury from anthracyclines. Cardiac MRI is a unique technique that has been shown to detect edema in various heart diseases. The investigators will test the theory that in women receiving treatment for breast cancer heart edema detected by MRI at the end of anthracyclines will identify patients who will later develop heart dysfunction. MRI studies with novel techniques will be done pre-therapy after anthracyclines during herceptin and at end of all therapy. The investigators will compare patients with and without heart dysfunction to test if patients with heart dysfunction are more likely to have edema after anthracyclines. Ultimately the investigators hope to use cardiac MRI to identify high risk patients and study various heart protective medications to prevent HF. This will improve the personal health of cancer patients by allowing them to live free of heart disease after their cancer therapy. Ultimately at a population level this will allow doctors to provide care that can be uniquely designed for each patient based on their individual risk.    ,NCT02306538

Breast Cancer,A Trial of a New Magnetic Breast Marking Clip, This small pilot will allow surgeons to perform wireless breast lumpectomies using a new magnetic technology. This is a continuation of a previous project testing the technology and the breast surgeons comfort level using this new technology. The aim of this project is to develop a new technique for surgical excision of lesions either through surgical biopsy or lumpectomy. The current standard of care involves placing a needle then slender wire through the lesion under image guidance by a radiologist. The surgeon then removes the lesion using the wire as a guide. This new technique would place a magnet through the lesion under image guidance by a radiologist. The surgeon would then use the MagneProbe in the operating room to locate the magnet and remove the lesion. This new technique would eliminate the use of a wire that protrudes from a patient's breast. This wire is usually placed on the day of surgery prior to the procedure. The goal of this new technique is to eliminate wire placement and increase patient comfort throughout the day of her surgery.    ,NCT02378558

Breast Cancer,Effect of Kinesiotaping for the Treatment of Hormone-induced Myalgia in Women Given Breast Cancer Survivors, Background: It has been demonstrated that aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are more effective than tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However despite the excellent results the side effects associated with them cause between 24.5 and 31.3% therapy abandon. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of Neuromuscular Taping (NMT) in the treatment of myalgia and arthralgia induced by AIs in women who have had breast cancer. Our goal is to improve their pain decreasing by 20% the values of their Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at various points in order to improve symptoms and increase adherence. Methods/Design: The study includes 156 breast cancer survivors treated with endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) from Virgen de la Victoria Hospital (Málaga Spain) and musculoskeletal disorders resulting from such treatment. Clinical and patient data were obtained from medical histories genetic and proteomic analysis grip strength and algometry measured questionnaires and the outcome of interest their VAS.

Breast Cancer,Clinical Trial With Two Physical Therapy Protocols After Breast Cancer Surgery and Immediate Reconstruction, Introduction: physical therapy is essential in preventing motor and functional complications after breast cancer surgery. However there is no prospective randomized study of different physiotherapy approaches in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery with immediate reconstruction. Objectives: to evaluate two physical therapy protocols in patients after breast cancer surgery with immediate reconstruction. A group with shoulder exercises with limited range of motion (ROM) at 90 degrees up to a month after surgery and a group with limited ROM only up to 15 days after surgery. Specific objectives: to evaluate shoulder ROM and pain one week before the surgery on average and 07 15 30 60 90 and 180 days after surgery; assess motor function one week before the surgery on average and 30 and 90 days after surgery; evaluate dehiscence and seroma 07 15 30 60 and 90 days after surgery; associate incidence of seroma and dehiscence with preoperative risk factors and compare all variables (shoulder ROM pain motor function seroma and dehiscence) between the two groups. Methods: women with breast cancer who will be submitted to breast surgery (radical or conservative) followed by immediate reconstruction: alloplastic (tissue expander or breast implant) or oncoplastic (breast reduction or contralateral symmetrization) will be included. Patients that will be submitted to bilateral oncology surgery reconstruction with autologous tissue or breast surgery without reconstruction will not be included. Patients will be recruited just after surgery scheduling and will undergo preoperative evaluation. At this moment preoperative analysis will be conducted with personal data and medical history. Patients will undergo new assessments 07 15 30 60 90 and 180 days after surgery. All patients will receive standard physiotherapy treatment for women undergoing breast reconstruction from Physical Therapy Sector. The protocol consists of early exercise limited to 90° of shoulder ROM starting the day after the surgery and repeated 7 days after surgery. After 15 days of surgery the patients will be randomized into two treatment protocols. One group will start to perform exercises with free shoulder ROM. Patients will be told only to limit the movement if they feel pain. The other group will keep shoulder exercises limited to 90° up to 30 days after surgery. At that moment (one month after surgery) they will also be allowed to move the shoulder with no restriction. The evaluation of the presence of dehiscence and seroma will occur by inspection and palpation. Shoulder ROM will be investigated through active goniometry of flexion extension adduction abduction internal rotation and external rotation. The pain will be assessed with the Verbal Numerical Scale from 0 to10 and upper limb function through the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire) questionnaire.    ,NCT02480842

Breast Cancer,Recombinant Human Endostatin (EndostarTM) Injection in Treatment of Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer, Endostatin has been widely applied for the clinical treatment of partial primary and metastatic solid tumors. Endostatin combined with chemotherapy has achieved favorable progression in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However the research about the efficacy of Endostatin on breast cancer has just started. Breast cancer is a highly-differentiated solid tumor indicating that it is also an indicator for Endostatin therapy. Additionally after chemo- and radiotherapy the primary nidi of patients with advanced breast cancer may also lead to rapid development of tumors in other locations. So Endostatin combined with chemotherapy can also improve the prognosis of patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer but there is rare any report at home and abroad. To further explore the above research this study designed a randomized opened and controlled clinical study to observe the clinical efficacy of EndostarTM Injection combined with GP/NP/GX/NX in the treatment of recurrent metastatic breast cancer.    ,NCT02489409

(ii) MEDI4736 can be safely co-administered at full dose with sequential with nab-paclitaxel (100mg/m2) and ddAC (60 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2 respectively).    ,NCT02489448
Breast Cancer,Impact of LOFT Therapy??on Breast Cancer Survivors," The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of LOFT Therapy in breast cancer survivors. In a previous study the investigators found that many patients are more debilitated at diagnosis than previously recognized. Both chemotherapy and anti-estrogen therapy have a large effect. Within 6 months patients replace muscle with fat leading to a significant reduction in muscle power and endurance. Our data suggests that common exercise recommendations for at least 150 minutes of exercise a week would be far beyond many of our patients' physical ability after therapy leading to the soreness injury frustration and early discontinuation (or failure to initiate an exercise program in the first place). The degree of muscle loss seen in our patients is similar to that documented in US astronauts after long-term space flight. Our collaborator Dr. Yvonne Cagle retired USAF flight surgeon noted that the cosmonauts were in better shape (had less muscle atrophy) than the astronauts. This difference was more than could be explained by the rigorous Russian exercise program. The only key distinction was the compressive ""penguin suits"" used by the Russians. This observation lead Dr. Cagle to develop a technique called low intensity off loaded-compressive therapy (LOFT) to replicate the impact of the Russian penguin suits for patients who were debilitated whether by space flight or by chronic conditions such as arthritis Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. The LOFT method does not require excessive exertion or strain on the joints. In field observations LOFT therapy improved muscle strength muscle mass endurance sleep quality and fatigue. This pilot study is the first to evaluate the safety feasibility and biologic impact of LOFT on breast cancer survivors.    ",NCT02491957

Breast Cancer,SurgiMend® vs. Strattice??in Direct to Implant Breast Reconstruction- A Prospective Randomized Trial, An increasing number of women undergo an immediate breast reconstruction where the mastectomy and the breast reconstruction are performed in the same surgery. To aid survival of the mastectomy skin flaps and to provide better aesthetic results acellular dermal matrixes (ADMs) are used to reinforce the breast. There are several different types of ADM available for this purpose. In this randomized clinical trial the following study will investigate two different types of ADM (Strattice??and SurgiMend®) in an immediate breast reconstructive setting. Sixty patients will be allocated on a 1:1 ratio to receive either Strattice??or SurgiMend® ADM. Patients scheduled for immediate breast reconstruction with ADM at pt. of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Aarhus University Hospital Aarhus Denmark will be offered participation. In total 60 patients will be included. Outcome parameters of interest are complication rate patient satisfaction aesthetic result and cost of the procedure. Satisfaction and aesthetic result will be measured at 4 and 12 months post surgery.    ,NCT02521623

Breast Cancer,Acute and Long-term Cardiovascular Toxicity After Modern Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer, In Europe breast cancer is by far the most common form of cancer diagnosed in women today accounting for 29% of all cases. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 90%. Surgery is usually combined with radiotherapy (RT) anthracyclines aromatase inhibitors and/or trastuzumab (Herceptin) which all have improved the life expectancy and survival in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately RT is associated with a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases which includes coronary artery disease valvular dysfunction congestive heart failure and stroke and is the most common non-malignancy cause of death. During the last two decades RT regimens for breast cancer have changed and the doses of radiation to which the heart is exposed are now potentially lower due to new and improved RT techniques. However there are no data on whether these new regimes decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. In this study the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases will be estimated 8 and 15 years after both conventional and laser assisted breath controlled RT and compared with cardiovascular diseases in the general female population. A further aim is to evaluate signs and prevalence of acute cardiotoxicity from RT with the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging coronary fractional flow reserve ECG and inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers and to investigate whether these signs can predict later cardiovascular disease. The importance of traditional cardiovascular risk factors (age hypertension hypercholesterolemia smoking habits and physical activity as registered before RT) will also be evaluated.    ,NCT02541435

Breast Cancer,Evaluating Outcomes of Immediate Breast Reconstruction (POBRAD-M)," Some women with breast cancer have their whole breast removed as part of their treatment (mastectomy). Of these women around 31% have more surgery to create a new breast.There are two main ways to create a new breast(i)using tissue from elsewhere on the body (""autologous"" reconstruction )or (ii)using a silicone implant. In recent years it has been reported that by using a material called an ""acellular dermal matrix"" (ADM) the results of breast reconstruction surgery using an implant can be improved. ADMs are materials which originally come from animal or human skin. They act like a sling supporting the lower part of an implant beneath the skin. Although ADMs have been approved for used in breast reconstruction and are safe there is very little high quality evidence to back up their reported benefits and some studies have suggested their use may in fact increase complications. The main purpose of this study is to find out what the actual risks and benefits of using an ADM in breast reconstruction surgery are. The investigators will follow the progress of women who have an implant based reconstruction to observe if participants develop problems; what those problems are and how participants feel about the results of their surgery. The investigators also follow the progress of women who undergo autologous reconstruction or alternative reconstructive techniques using an implant for the same reasons.    ",NCT02557906

Breast Cancer,Assessment of Breast Cancer Response to Neoadjuvant Anthracycline-based Chemotherapy by FDG-PET and Molecular Markers," A correlation between early changes in the tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on FDG-PET after one or two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and the pathological response after 6 to 8 cycles has been demonstrated in several independent small series of patients. Breast tumor proliferation status has previously been demonstrated to be a good predictive factor of response to chemotherapy. The best method for assessing proliferation status is unclear. Proportion of cells staining for nuclear Ki67 antigen is the most widely used assay for comparing the proliferation status between tumors. However major variations in analytical procedure and interpretation limited its clinical value. Taking into account the prognosis and predictive value of proliferation gene as a common ""signature"" in breast cancer transcriptome analysis quantitative assessment of mRNA expression of genes involved in proliferation has been developed by the investigators team and others. The evaluation of these parameters is quantitative and reliable and can be standardized for a clinical use. The main objective of the investigators study is to early predict pathological response to anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using a combination of parameters based on FDG-PET imaging performed at baseline and after 2 cycles and molecular markers of proliferation measured on pre-treatment biopsy (Ki67 protein level by immunohistochemistry and Ki67 mRNA level and the mRNA (messenger RNA) expression of the most pertinent genes of the Genomic Grade Index (GGI) component by RT (reverse transcriptase) - qPCR).

Breast Cancer,Breast Reconstruction Outcomes With and Without StratticE," Approximately 4000 women undergo a mastectomy for breast cancer each year in the UK and around 1500 will have an immediate breast reconstruction. Approximately half of these ladies will have an implant-based breast reconstruction of which many have an ""implant-assisted"" breast reconstruction with an Acellular Dermal Matrix. Strattice??is an Acellular Dermal Matrix (a pig skin product) made by Acelity. It is used to cover and disguise the lower part of the breast implant. Acellular Dermal Matrices have only been widely used for the last eight years and long-term outcomes for women who have had this form of reconstruction are lacking. Despite this it is one of the most commonly offered methods of breast reconstruction in the UK for both ladies with a diagnosis of breast cancer and in the risk-reduction setting. The objective of this study is to assess long-term outcomes of Strattice??based breast reconstructions in multiple Breast Surgery Centres across the UK. This will be a case-control study comparing women who have had an immediate implant-based breast reconstruction with Strattice??(case) or without (control). This will be achieved by review and analysis of retrospective data from patients who have undergone immediate breast reconstruction using implants with or without Strattice??following either a diagnosis breast cancer or for risk-reduction. In addition there will be a prospective clinical assessment of the reconstruction outcomes. Outcomes assessed will include complications surgical re-interventions and aesthetic results. These will be related to co-morbid conditions and other risk factors. Data will also be collected on unplanned interventions associated with a cost if available.    ",NCT02608593
Breast Cancer,Investigation of Three Approaches to Address Fear of Recurrence Among Breast Cancer Survivors, Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is one of the most prevalent persistent and disruptive sources of distress for adult cancer survivors. Prevalence rates for FCR have been estimated at up to 89% with approximately half of cancer survivors reporting clinically significant levels of FCR. Despite the recognized prevalence persistence and suffering associated with FCR effective and accessible treatments for FCR are lacking and urgently needed.

Breast Cancer,Smart-phone Health Coaching Intervention to Promote Maintenance of Exercise in Breast Cancer Survivors:Protocol, While physical activity (PA) appears to play an important role in disease control and the promotion of long-term health and well-being of cancer survivors the large majority of breast cancer survivors are not physically active. Addressing this problem requires exercise promotion and an additional method of supporting long term exercise adherence. In response an innovative health coaching intervention which uses mobile technology (iMOVE) to promote long-term PA in breast cancer survivors (BrCa) was developed. Project description: 107 inactive BrCa survivors will be randomized to receive a 12-week exercise program (CONTROL) OR a 12 week exercise program plus a concurrent health coaching program (iMOVE) consisting of telephone-based coaching sessions and interactive software delivered through a smart-phone and Fit-bit (wearable fitness technology) (INTERVENTION). Information on the feasibility and acceptability of the methods and intervention and examine the impact on fitness (primary) patient-reported anthropometric and physical (secondary) outcomes will be collected. Impact and relevance: PA has increasingly been identified as a modifiable factor that has the potential to impact cancer outcomes and improve quality of life. iMOVE is an innovative intervention with the potential to promote and maintain physical activity for breast cancer survivors. This study will be the first step in the evaluation of iMOVE and will help to determine whether a larger randomized controlled trial is needed.    ,NCT02620735
Breast Cancer,Women Informed to Screen Depending on Measures of Risk," Most physicians still use a one-size-fits-all approach to breast screening in which all women regardless of their personal history family history or genetics (except BRCA carriers) are recommended to have annual mammograms starting at age 40. Mammograms benefit women by detecting cancers early when they are easier to treat but they are not perfect. Recent news stories have discussed some of the potential harms: large numbers of positive results that cause stressful recalls for additional mammograms and biopsies. With the current screening approach half of the women who undergo annual screening for ten years will have at least one false positive biopsy. Potentially more important are cancer diagnoses for growths that might never come to clinical attention if left alone (called ""overdiagnosis""). This can lead to unnecessary treatment. Even more concerning is evidence that up to 20% of breast cancers detected today may fall into the category of ""overdiagnosis."" This proposal compares annual screening with a risk-based breast cancer screening schedule based upon each woman's personal risk of breast cancer. The investigators have designed the study to be inclusive of all so that even women who might be nervous about being randomly assigned to receive a particular type of care (a procedure that is typical in clinical studies) will still be able to participate by choosing the type of care they receive. For participants in the risk-based screening arm each woman will receive a personal risk assessment that includes her family and medical history breast density measurement and tests for genes (mutations and variations) linked to the development of breast cancer. Women who have the highest personal risk of developing breast cancer will receive more frequent screening while women with a lower personal risk would receive less frequent screening. No woman will be screened less than is recommended by the USPSTF breast cancer screening guidelines. If this study is successful women will gain a realistic understanding of their personal risk of breast cancer as well as strategies to reduce their risk and fewer women will suffer from the anxiety of false positive mammograms and unnecessary biopsies. The investigators believe this study has the potential to transform breast cancer screening in America.    ",NCT02620852
Breast Cancer,Tumor Bed Dose Delivery Using A Breast Specific Radiosurgery Device The Gammapod: (A Clinical Feasibility Study), Conventional breast radiotherapy is delivered to the entirety of the breast in fractionated treatments given over several weeks. While these techniques are effective there is a risk of late adverse events from irradiation of surrounding normal tissues and the protracted nature of the treatments is inconvenient to patients and resource-intensive for health care systems. There is an unmet need for novel treatments that can be delivered more quickly with reduced normal tissue exposure and without compromising efficacy. The GammaPod is a breast-specific radiotherapy delivery device that holds the promise in addressing these needs. Employing the engineering and physics principles from stereotactic radiotherapy it allows delivery of a highly-localized radiation dose to a very limited volume of breast. The Ottawa Hospital is the only Canadian member of a consortium of five academic institutions that have acquired the GammaPod in order to rigorously evaluate its use in clinical trials. The aim of the current project is to complete a mandatory clinical feasibility study of the GammaPod as part of the application for Investigational Testing of Medical Devices from Health Canada. The study will focus on the use of the GammaPod to deliver a radiotherapy boost that is a localized dose of radiation just around the surgical bed in a single treatment.    ,NCT02627313

Breast Cancer,Anticancer Treatment of Breast Cancer Related to Cardiotoxicity and Dysfunctional Endothelium, Several cytotoxic regimens are related to endothelial cell damage and vascular toxicity. Endothelial dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of all known cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and closely related to the metabolic syndrome. Both CVD and diabetes contributes importantly to total mortality and to breast cancer (BC) specific mortality. In the epidemiological part of the project the investigators will determine the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity/mortality in early BC patients compared to the Danish background population. In the clinical part the investigators will study the changes of endothelial function and metabolic parameters in BC patients receiving chemotherapy. With increasing number of BC survivors long-term consequences of curative cancer treatment should be studied. The investigators hypothesize that cytotoxic therapy worsens metabolic parameters possibly through endothelial dysfunction. If this is true the next step will be to evaluate how strict metabolic control will affect prognosis.    ,NCT02652975

Breast Cancer,A Registry Study of Breast Microseed Treatment, For women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer lumpectomy followed by radiation is a common treatment option. Radiation treatment is typically delivered to the whole breast five times per week for anywhere from 3 to 8 weeks. The radiation helps kill any cancer cells that may have been left over following the surgery but causes skin burns. Many studies have demonstrated that radiation to the whole breast is not necessary that it can be delivered to a portion of the breast where the cancer is more likely to recur. A technique called a Permanent Breast Seed Implant (PBSI) involving the implantation of radioactive seeds has been developed to deliver the radiation to a portion of the breast. The procedure is performed on an out-patient basis under local anesthesia and light sedation. Because the radioactive seeds are permanently implanted in the breast the patient is able to live a normal life while the seeds deliver the prescribed radiation to the breast. Previous studies on PBSI demonstrate that it is a safe and effective alternative form of radiation for appropriately selected patients after lumpectomy. However those results have been obtained mainly from a single institution with only 4 patients treated in another center. Further research is still needed to evaluate its safety in a multi-center setting. The purpose of this study is to ensure the appropriate training of clinicians who will be performing this procedure and to capture long term outcomes and rare complications if any.    ,NCT02701244

Breast Cancer,Study of Cirmtuzumab and Paclitaxel for Metastatic or Locally Advanced Unresectable Breast Cancer, The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety of the investigational drug called cirmtuzumab in combination with the breast cancer drug paclitaxel. Cirmtuzumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. This drug is designed to attach to a protein called ROR1 that is on the surface of breast cancer cells. This blocks growth and survival of the breast cancer cells. ROR1 is rarely expressed on healthy cells so this drug should target the cancer cells. Cirmtuzumab is considered experimental because its use is not approved by United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although there is evidence from tests on laboratory animals that cirmtuzumab can decrease the number of breast cancer cells we do not know if this will work in humans. This drug has been tested in humans before but has never been tested in patients with breast cancer or in combination with paclitaxel in humans. Therefore the goal of this study is to see if cirmtuzumab is safe and tolerable when in given in combination with paclitaxel in study participants. You will be evaluated to find out what effects (good and bad) cirmtuzumab has on you and we would like to learn more about how cirmtuzumab might affect the growth of your cancer cells. We would also like to see how long the drug stays in your body and what affects the drug may have on your body.    ,NCT02776917

Breast Cancer,Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Oncological Surgery of Breast, Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in the female population Brazilian except non-melanoma skin tumors. Surgery plays an important role in regional spot disease control and the definition of parameters for the adjuvant treatment indication. Surgical site infections (SSI) are defined as wound infections occur following invasive procedures corresponding to 14-16% of all infections nosocomial in hospitalized patients the most common among patients surgical. SSIs should be examined as potential wound contamination surgical understood as the number of micro-organisms in the body and / or tissue being operated. Considering this aspect the cancer surgery breast are classified by their potential for contamination by clean. The use of antibiotics to prevent the SSI in mastectomies is not standardized in Handbook of National Health Surveillance Agency due to the effectiveness of undocumented prophylaxis Thus the use of antibiotics may vary among services. So this randomized clinical trial to evaluate the influence of the use of Prophylactic antibiotics in SSI rates in oncological breast surgery.    ,NCT02809729

Breast Cancer,Triple Negative Breast Cancer: Identification Pilot Study of Predictive Transcriptome Profiles of Early Tumor Drug Resistance Observed in 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, Breast cancer is a major public health problem. In France it is the leading cause of cancer death in women. According to the National Cancer Institute (INCA) approximately 49000 new cases were diagnosed in 2012 in France. It is an heterogeneous disease comprising a plurality of entities whose clinical behavior biological and prognosis differ. Amongst these entities the breast cancer triple negative (TN) is defined by the absence of expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone and the absence of overexpression of HER2 oncoprotein. It represents about 15% of breast cancers and occurs more frequently in young women. This is a very proliferative tumor phenotype with metastatic potential. Because of its genomic heterogeneity and lack of recurrent identified molecular target no targeted therapy has today shown benefit in terms of survival compared to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy which partly explains the very poor prognosis of this tumor phenotype. The positron emission tomography (PET) with 18Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) is a molecular imaging test that can identify from the first or second neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment non-responder patients to treatment with low probability of pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For this two FDG-PET examinations should be performed; a) a pretreatment PET b) a control PET after one or two treatments. The objective of this pilot single-center prospective study is a preliminary identification of recurrent genomic alterations among triple-negative tumors with early chemoresistance identified by PET in the first cycle of neoadjuvant therapy.    ,NCT02850302
Breast Cancer,Single Versus Multiple Injection Ultrasound Guided Paravertebral Blocks, Paravertebral block (PVB) has been shown to provide excellent analgesia for major breast surgeries resulting in reduced narcotic consumption reduced nausea improved quality of recovery reduced chronic pain and possibly reduced metastasis with breast cancer. Traditionally PVB is done by multiple injections below T1-T5 transverse processes. With multiple injections the risk is increased for a pleural an intraneural and/or an intravascular injection. Recently ultrasonography is being used to facilitate PVB. The use of ultrasound imaging enables real-time needle visualization during the procedure. This may improve efficacy and reduce the chances of complication like pneumothorax. Currently there are no data comparing ultrasound-guided single injection technique with multiple injections technique with regards to extent of spread for PVB. Our objective is to investigate the extent of dermatomal spread of PVB when equal volumes of local anesthetic are injected at one versus five paravertebral sites for patients undergoing major breast surgery. In addition the investigators wish to compare the performance time and duration of analgesia. Methodology: After local REB approval 72 patients undergoing a unilateral mastectomy with or without axillary node dissection will be randomized to receive either single or multiple injections PVB. The PVB will be performed in prone position under real-time ultrasound guidance using a para-sagittal approach.The patients in single injection group will receive single injection PVB at T3-T4 level with 25 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine and four subcutaneous sham injections. Patients in the multiple injection group will receive five injections of PVB from T1 to T5 level. 5 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine will be injected at each level. Pleural drift will be used as a sign of correct needle tip location and local anaesthetic spread. The pinprick method will be used to assess the extent of dermatomal blockade 20 minutes following the completion of procedure. All patients will receive a standardized general anesthesia for the surgery. Any adverse events including pneumothorax epidural spread LA toxicity/seizure total spinal will be recorded.    ,NCT02852421

Breast Cancer,Reader Study for Image Quality of Cone Beam Breast CT System, Koning Breast CT (KBCT) was approved by FDA PMA. The X-ray detector originally used in Koning Breast CT was PaxScan 4030CB. Recently Koning Breast CT uses a modified X-ray detector PaxScan 4030MCT. The modified detector is essentially identical to the previous model except a different detector housing which allows a narrower dead-space between the active area and the top of the housing. The benefit of the modified detector is that it allows Koning to modify the patient exam table achieving a flatter surface in the center. The flatter surface will increase patient comfort and improve workflow. Meanwhile flatter surface may also affect patient positioning and the coverage of the breast. The adequacy of the overall image quality with the new table/detector should be verified by radiologists.    ,NCT02864667
Breast Cancer,Behavioral Symptom Management Program for Breast Cancer in Singapore and The US, Research indicates that up to two-thirds of patients with advanced cancer experience significant symptom burden (e.g. anxiety and depression pain fatigue) yet these symptoms are not adequately addressed. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols designed to teach patients strategies to increase their sense of self-efficacy to manage symptoms may be helpful in alleviating multiple cancer-related symptoms. The efficacy of CBT protocols for reducing distinct symptoms in early-stage breast cancer has been shown; however the role of CBT protocols for multiple symptoms in late-stage cancer is less clear. The current study aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability as well as obtain an initial estimate of efficacy of a novel cross-cultural CBT intervention that addresses multiple symptoms in advanced breast cancer patients. The target outcomes of intervention will be reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression pain and fatigue. A randomized controlled design will compare patients receiving a CBT protocol to a waitlist control in both Singapore and US patients. The larger goal of this collaborative effort is to determine the scalability of such an intervention that can potentially provide needed symptom burden relief to advanced cancer patients.    ,NCT02865148

Breast Cancer,PREgnancy and FERtility Registry, The PREgnancy and FERtility (PREFER) study is a comprehensive program aiming to optimize care and improve knowledge around the topics of fertility preservation and pregnancy issues in young breast cancer patients. The program was initiated at the National Institute for Cancer Research IRCCS AOU San Martino - IST in Genova (Liguria Region Italy) and then it has been spread to other Italian Institutions under the umbrella of the Gruppo Italiano Mammella (GIM) study group. It is composed of two distinctive studies one assessing fertility (i.e. PREFER-FERTILITY) and the other pregnancy (PREFER-PREGNANCY) issues. Hence two different study protocols were developed under the umbrella of the PREFER registry. PREFER-FERTILITY aims to obtain and centralize data about the preferences and choices of young cancer patients on the fertility preservation strategies available in Italy. Furthermore it aims to assess the outcomes of patients undergoing one or more strategies for fertility preservation in terms of success of the techniques (i.e. recovery of ovarian function number of cryopreserved oocytes post-treatment pregnancies) and safety (i.e. long-term survival outcomes). PREFER-PREGNANCY has two main objectives: 1) to obtain and centralize data on the management of breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy the obstetrical and paediatric care of children born after prior in utero exposure to anticancer treatments and the long-term survival outcomes of these patients; 2) to obtain and centralize data on the clinical outcomes of breast cancer survivors that achieve a pregnancy after prior diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.    ,NCT02895165

Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Tomosynthesis for Characterization and the Management of Breast Lesions, Tomosynthesis is an innovative technique developed in digital mammography for obtaining a sectional image of the breast. Mammography has the main disadvantage of being an imaging projection that creates overlays which eliminates tomosynthesis. The objective of this study is to evaluate if the BI-RADS classification obtained by tomosynthesis with synthetic mammography is superior to that obtained by conventional mammography in terms of specificity while not inferior in terms of sensitivity.    ,NCT02959398
Breast Cancer,Delphinus SoftVue Prospective Case Collection - ARM 2, The SoftVue??is a whole breast ultrasound system with an automated scanning curvilinear ring?array transducer that employs UST. It is currently cleared under FDA 510(k) K123209 and K142517 for use as both a B?mode ultrasonic breast imaging system and color imaging of transmission data (sound speed and attenuation). SoftVue??is not intended to be used as a replacement for screening mammography. SoftVue uses non?ionizing ultrasound energy to generate tomographic image volumes of the whole breast. While the patient lays prone on a padded table with one breast comfortably submerged in a bath of warm water a ring?shaped transducer 22 cm in diameter encircles the breast and pulses low?frequency sound waves through the water and into the breast tissue. More than 2000 elements in the curvilinear transducer's 360 degree array emit and receive ultrasound signals to analyze echoes from the breast anatomy in all directions from the chest wall to the nipple. Not only does SoftVue capture data from the reflection of the sound waves off of tissue boundaries and structures within the breast but because the transducer surrounds the whole breast SoftVue also captures signals that are transmitted through the breast. This additional transmission data enhances the visualization of the anatomic structure of the breast tissue and is not currently available in any other commercially marketed breast ultrasound device. This prospective multicenter multi?arm clinical case collection program is IRB?approved and will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable regulatory requirements. Arm 2 aims to collectively enroll up to 1000 women at a total of up to 8 clinical sites. The design of Arm 2 in this protocol is strictly limited to case collection and is non-interventional; any investigational and/or statistical plans for future analyses will be prepared and registered separately if they are applicable to the requirements of FDAAA 801. Arm 2 is limited to the cohort of diagnostic female patients of any breast density composition category who have been recommended for a breast biopsy (BI-RADS 4 or 5) after diagnostic imaging or who have confirmed imaging findings. Matched sets of diagnostic imaging and SV exams from the same patient demographic information and clinical outcome data will be collected during diagnostic workup. Ultrasound characteristics for all types of lesions whether they are benign or malignant will be collected as well as objective and subjective breast density composition data. Ultrasound image data may be acquired with modified SoftVue devices which have passed safety and quality evaluations per Delphinus' quality management system (QMS) and satisfy design change control standards at select clinical sites in accordance with 21 CFR 812.2 (b) as a routine part of feasibility validation and verification testing for engineering and product development purposes. The exams and clinical data accumulated in this prospective case collection (PCC) protocol will populate a database from which future investigations may be designed for peer reviewed publication development of user training curricula building teaching case and creating new marketing materials for SoftVue.    ,NCT02977247

Breast Cancer,Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy in Breast Cancer, Thermotherapy is a technology aiming at destroying tissue for example tumor tissue. Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy (imILT) is a specific form of thermotherapy which in addition to destroying tumor tissue has been optimized to cause a tumor specific immunologic response. In laboratory animals the imILT method has also been shown to induce a so called abscopal effect. This means that when one tumor is treated with imILT other untreated tumors also decrease in size. The immunologic response has previously been characterized in breast cancer patients after receiving imILT treatment  and presumed abscopal effects induced by imILT have also been described in a malignant melanoma patient. The purpose of this trial is to investigate the functionality and safety of the imILT treatment method in patients diagnosed with breast cancer. The treatment method has successfully been used for treatment of patients with breast cancer and malignant melanoma. Treatment of breast cancer patients caused an increase of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the treated tumor as well as activated dendritic cells at the tumor border. Regulatory T lymphocytes decreased in the regional lymph nodes. This trial is explorative prospective open and non-randomized. Five breast cancer patients will be treated in this trial which is estimated to be carried out during a time period of 9 months.    ,NCT03039127

Breast Cancer,Lapatinib or Trastuzumab Given Prior to Surgery With Chemotherapy in Patients With Early Breast Cancer, This study will test the safety of a drug called lapatinib and how well it works. Lapatinib (also called Tyverb or Tykerb) will be compared with another drug trastuzumab (also called Herceptin). Trastuzumab is an antibody against the HER2 protein. It binds to part of the HER2 protein to stop it working. Clinical trials have found that adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy lowers the rate of cancer recurrence and improves survival in women with HER2 positive breast cancer. Lapatinib also stops the HER2 protein working and may slow or stop cancer cells from growing and may prevent cancer from returning. Lapatinib has been approved in some countries to treat patients with certain types of breast cancer. However lapatinib has not been approved to treat early breast cancer. This study is one of many being carried out involving lapatinib in early breast cancer and these studies are showing that it is a promising treatment. This study will compare lapatinib and trastuzumab. One group of people will take lapatinib and another group will take trastuzumab. The effects of the drugs both good and bad will be compared. This study will compare two different durations of HER2 treatment to see if earlier introduction of HER2 treatment is beneficial. The lapatinib group will receive HER2 treatment from the very beginning for 24 weeks prior to surgery and the trastuzumab group will only receive HER2 therapy for 12 weeks prior to surgery.    ,NCT01205217

Breast Cancer,Safety Study of Cancer Stem Cell Vaccinie to Treat Breast Cancer, Most studies of cancer stem cells (CSC) involve the inoculation of cells from human tumors into immunosuppressed mice preventing an assessment on the immunologic interactions and effects of CSCs. In this study the investigators examined the vaccination effects produced by CSC-enriched populations from histologically distinctmurine tumors after their inoculation into different syngeneic immunocompetent hosts. Enriched CSCs were immunogenic and more effective as an antigen source than unselected tumor cells in inducing protective antitumor immunity.Immune sera from CSC-vaccinated hosts contained high levels of IgG which bound to CSCs resulting in CSC lysis in the presence of complement.CTLs generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or splenocytes harvested from CSC-vaccinated hosts were capable of killing CSCs in vitro. Mechanistic investigations established that CSC-primed antibodies and T cells were capable of selective targeting CSCs and conferring antitumor immunity.    ,NCT02063893
Breast Cancer,Evaluation of Biomarkers Associated With Response to Subsequent Therapies in Subjects With HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer, This is a multicenter open-label Phase II study in subjects with Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer who received at least 2 prior lines of anti-HER2-targeted therapies of which at least one included a Trastuzumab-containing regimen. This study is a post-approval commitment with regulatory authorities. It is designed with the primary endpoint to evaluate the changes in biomarkers associated with HER family immunomodulation apoptosis and Adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporters between the pre-treatment and disease progression biopsy. It is hypothesized that these changes in biomarkers may modulate resistance mechanisms and thereby alters the response to subsequent chemotherapy based regimens. Therefore in addition to the description of the clinical outcome of Overall response rate Clinical benefit rate Progression-free survival and Overall survival for each arm Progression-free survival on next-line therapies will be collected and summarized for each arm. All subjects will receive study treatment until disease progression unacceptable toxicity or subject withdrawal and after which will be followed for subsequent anticancer therapy and disease progression events and survival. The primary endpoint of the study will be to evaluate changes in expression of biomarkers associated with the HER family or receptors and ligands immunomodulation apoptosis and ABC transports between a pre-treatment biopsy and the disease progression biopsy. This study will evaluate potential mechanisms to explore the antitumor activity of dual blockade and will provide a descriptive clinical outcome for subjects treated with Trastuzumab in combination with Lapatinib or chemotherapy.

Breast Cancer,Analysis of Prognostic and Predictive Genomic Signatures Using Archival Paraffin-embedded Breast Tumor - a Pilot Study, A number of prognostic and/or predictive genomic signatures for breast cancer have been developed by Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS). In the past 1 year GIS has developed protocols and methods to conduct expression assays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens. A study on 800 tumor samples is planned to analyze these gene signatures and compare them with conventional clinical prognosticators and predictors. As the investigators plan to use archival tumor samples that dates back to the 1990s the aim of this pilot study is to first analyze 10 anonymized samples to determine the feasibility of running these assays on old archival blocks. The information generated will help us determine whether very old samples (diagnosed before 2000) may be selected for the actual study.    ,NCT01247467
Breast Cancer,Analysis of Prognostic and Predictive Genomic Signatures Using Archival Paraffin-embedded Tumor Specimens in Breast Cancer," Major Aims of study:   1. To create a gene expression-based prognostic device that complements or exceeds the prognostic utility of conventional biomarkers of breast cancer outcome.   2. To identify one or more clinical subgroups of patients for which the prognostic device outperforms or substantially adds to the prognostic performance of conventional markers that currently determine therapeutic strategies. Sub-Aims of study:   1. Assess the prognostic value of the multiple gene expression signatures alone and in combination using a large cohort of breast cancer patients for which pathology treatment and outcome is available. A ""training"" and ""testing"" design is proposed.   2. Evaluate the utility of a prognostic device that measures gene expression levels from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens (FFPEs) of primary resected tumors. The investigators will utilize the Affymetrix Quantigene 2.0 Assay and/or the Illumina BeadXpress VeraCode DASL Gene Expression Assay (FDA-approved IVDMIA.)   3. For specific clinical subgroups of patients/tumors the investigators will mathematically identify additive or synergistic prognostic relationships between genes and gene signatures that in combination will yield maximal risk prediction (distant metastases-free survival) for patients.   4. Compare the prognostic utility of the investigators device to that of the conventional prognostic variables that are currently used to determine therapeutic strategy.   5. Incorporate the prognostic signatures into a practical prognosis algorithm that seeks to include conventional measures of outcome such as tumor size histologic grade nodal status patient age or Nottingham index etc. The investigators hypothesize that adequate quality and quantity of tumor RNA may be extracted from archival paraffin-embedded tumor specimens for gene expression profiling and that archival tumor-derived genomic signatures may be used as prognosticators or predictors in breast cancer.

Breast Cancer,Chemotherapy on Methylation Patterns in Breast Tumor Tissue Correlating With Clinical Response and Outcomes, Primary Objectives   1. To identify hypermethylated genes in paired pretreatment breast tumor tissue and plasma samples from locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer patients using a known gene panel which includes APC1 Cyclin D2 RARB RASSF1A Twist Hin1 and GSTP1. Rationale: We and others have determined the optimal panel of genes that are able to detect free DNA in plasma and serum. We will determine if the same panel of genes is effective for detecting tumor DNA in the plasma of locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer patients. Further to determine if the methylation profile of the plasma DNA for these genes is the same or different from the primary tumor at presentation we will analyze the primary tumor DNA from fresh frozen samples.   2. To identify methylation pattern changes in the same subset of patients' plasma samples at 24 hours after completion of cycle 1 of chemotherapy and within 24 hours before cycle 2. Rationale: The optimal timing of sampling for methylation analysis that is reflective of the tumors response to chemotherapy is not known. How soon methylation changes are observed whether they are high within 24 hours as that tumor responds to chemotherapy or whether changes can be observed only some time after one cycle of chemotherapy will be studied. (3) To also identify methylation pattern changes in breast tumor tissue after one cycle of chemotherapy. Rationale: To look for a correlation with plasma methylation patterns Secondary Objectives (1) To correlate our observed patterns of methylation pre- and post-treatment with clinical parameters such as clinical and/or radiological response and patient outcome.    ,NCT00698477
Breast Cancer,A Pilot Study Evaluation of the Efficacy of SonoVue to Detect and Characterise Breast Lesions, Ultrasound is a well-established imaging modality for the evaluation of breast disease. The investigators' objective is to characterise the properties of an intravascular ultrasonographic contrast agent SonoVue (sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles) to improve the diagnostic value of the ultrasound examination in patients with different breast lesions. The final purpose of this ultrasonography is to allow the early detection of tumors and to improve the differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. SonoVue® (sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles) is a microbubbles preparation that is stable resistant to pressure and specifically designed to be used as a contrast agent for ultrasound imaging. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound could provide a non-invasive technique to evaluate the morphology of breast tumour vascularity.    ,NCT00243698
Breast Cancer,Evaluate the Use of the Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Determining if the Breast Tumor is Benign or Malignant, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a novel imaging technique for noninvasive probing of biochemical properties of tissue. While MRS does not generate images of tumor per se it allows biochemical spectroscopic data to be obtained in vivo from user defined region-of-interest. In this manner biochemical information elucidated by MRS can be interpreted in relation to detailed anatomy and images of metabolite distribution can be created. The aim of MRS is to identify presence and concentration of metabolites characteristic for normal and abnormal (tumor) cellular activities hence allow differential normal tissue from pathological tissue as well as allow differentiating malignant from benign tumors.    ,NCT00639171
Breast Cancer,Biomarker Study of Breast Tumors, This protocol aims to create a tissue bank of breast tumors obtained at the time of diagnosis for the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis prognostication and prediction of treatment response in breast cancer. While tissue banks now exist in major hospitals in Singapore to collect tumor specimens at the time of surgery specimens collected at surgery from patients who had undergone pre-operative treatment represent a post-treatment sample and not a baseline untreated sample. Such samples are intrinsically different from untreated samples and have to be analyzed separately from untreated samples. However they remain valuable samples particularly if a pre-treatment sample has been obtained providing paired pre- and post-treatment samples which could provide valuable information on treatment-related tumor biomarker changes. A tissue bank comprising of samples collected during the diagnostic core biopsy thus represents a valuable supplement to existing tissue banks. Approximately 10-20% of patients diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer will require neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition future clinical trials may include 'window-of-opportunity' studies during which biological therapy is administered for a short period (2-3 weeks) while an operable breast cancer patient is awaiting definitive surgery. The majority of early-stage breast cancer patients would be eligible for such trials allowing the rapid recruitment of breast cancer patients. When coupled with analysis of surrogate markers of response (eg apoptosis anti-angiogenic effects etc) these unique clinical trials could provide valuable insights into the biological effects of new therapeutic agents in evaluation.    ,NCT00941408
Breast Cancer,Levobupivacaine and Lidocaine for Paravertebral Block Causes Greater Hemodynamic Oscillations Than Levobupivacaine, The purpose and the goal of this paper is to show whether the application of a combination of two local anesthetics as opposed to the application of one local anesthetic at paravertebral block changes the hemodynamic variable. It is therefore a prospective randomized double- blind study where we do a clinical trial in patients ASA(American Society of Anesthesiologists) 1 and 2 statuses between 18 and 80 years of age using the ultrasound in plane technology.Upon arrival of patients in the unit for preparation procedures for anesthesia we set the ECG(electrocardiograph) noninvasive blood pressure oxygen saturation and arterial cannula in the radial artery After sterile washing of the dorsal surface paravertebral space was identified with ultrasound using 8 Hz(hertz) linear transducer probe then needle position was confirmed with neurostimulation at the level of 2.0 - 5.0 mA(milliampere). When muscle contraction persisted at 0.4mA(milliampere) the anesthetic was applied in levels of Th 2 Th3 and Th 4 (70 milliliters per level). We applied the 0.5 % levobupivacaine and 2 % lidocaine 70 milliliters of mixture per level in one group while only 0.5 % levobupivacaine also 70 milliliters. by level in the second one. After that the invasive hemodynamic monitoring was placed on patients and the induction with 1 % propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg.and Vecuronium 008 mg/kg. was performed with the application of supraglottic airway gel of appropriate size. The maintenance of anesthesia and sedation will be conducted with Propofol 1 % continuously ( 25-150 mcg / kg / min.)The measurements will be taken every 5 minutes during the first hour of the application of paravertebral block then every 15 minutes during the second hour and if the operation takes more than two hours the measurements are performed every 30 minutes. Postoperatively invasive hemodynamic monitoring will be removed in post-anesthesia recovery room together with the arterial cannula and the patient will be sent to the hospital ward with non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring (blood pressure pulse saturation) until the termination of the blocks.Statistical methods By comparing two target groups we analysed the strength of the test with following assumptions: X2 difference test the expected difference in variances in stroke volume between groups of 60% α significance level of 0.05 and the minimum statistical test strength of 85%. The required total sample should include at least 80 patients that is 40 per group.Data will be presented in tables and graphs. Descriptive statistics of examined variables with appropriate measures of central tendency will be made. Smirnov -Kolmogorov test will assess the normality of data distribution. According to the received results the appropriate parametric and / or nonparametric tests will be used. Comparisons of quantitative values between the two groups will be analyzed using the independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Dependent values within each group will be analyzed using analysis of variance for repeated measures or Friedman test. Differences in categorical values will be analyzed by X2 test. The appropriate regression model will be made in order to predict the variability of stroke volume in which the dependent variable will be a variation of the stroke volume while relevant clinical values will be taken as predictor variables. All P values smaller than 0.05 will be considered significant. This research is to present the main results - the existence of the significant change in Stroke Volume Variation (SVV) between groups using invasive hemodynamic monitoring the changes of Stroke Volume Variation(SVV) depending on the time from the application within groups differences in volume compensation of crystalloids and colloids and the need for the application of vasoactive drugs. Furthermore as a secondary results we will present the time to maximal block development the duration of post operative analgesia patient satisfaction and time needed for the full recovery from the block.    ,NCT02004834

Breast Cancer,The Symphony Triple A Study: Using Symphony in Treatment Decisions Concerning Adjuvant Systemic Therapy, Rationale: Prediction of prognosis in patients with breast cancer is important to determine the indication for adjuvant chemo- endocrine- and immunotherapy. Apart from the clinicopathological parameters incorporated into the Adjuvant!Online predictive model the validated 70-gene signature MammaPrint® is predictive of outcome too. MammaPrint® is advised in the current Dutch CBO guideline (2012) for hormone receptor positive invasive ductal breast cancer in individual cases when there is 'doubt' about the indication for adjuvant chemotherapy based on traditional prognostic factors. In the present study MammaPrint® is used in this CBO 2012 guideline defined group of patients as an additional test for decision-making for adjuvant chemotherapy. Objective: To assess the impact of MammaPrint® on clinical decision making regarding the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy in the CBO 2012 guideline defined group of hormone receptor positive invasive ductal carcinoma patients when there is doubt about the indication for adjuvant chemotherapy based on traditional prognostic factors. The influence of various factors and the impact of MammaPrint® in predefined subgroups will be analyzed too. Data from a national registry regarding adjuvant systemic treatment in patients with similar clinicopathological characteristics in whom MammaPrint® was not used will be obtained to provide a control group. Hypothesis: In the group of patients where national guidelines advocate using systemic therapy but doctors are ambivalent in treating patients with adjuvant chemotherapy it is hypothesized that using MammaPrint® as an additional test will change the indication for adjuvant therapy in a substantial proportion of patients resulting in at least 10% less patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus in the study group at least 10% less patients will receive chemotherapy when compared to a contemporary group of patients with similar clinicopathological characteristics but without using MammaPrint® Study population: Hormone receptor positive invasive ductal breast cancer patients when there is doubt about the indication for adjuvant chemotherapy based on traditional prognostic factors. Study design: This is a prospective multicentre impact study.    ,NCT02209857

Breast Cancer,Trial Evaluating Role of Post Mastectomy Radiotherapy in Women With Node Negative Early Breast Cancer," Postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) is unequivocally beneficial in reducing the recurrences as well as improving survival in node positive breast cancer patients. PMRT for women with T1-T2 tumors and negative axillary nodes is not generally warranted because of the presumed low risk of recurrence in this population as a whole. However in the setting of multiple adverse prognostic factors the recurrence risk approaches and in some cases surpasses the risk of recurrence documented for patients with one to three positive lymph nodes. Numerous retrospective series have reported the outcome and patterns of failure for post-mastectomy patients treated without radiation. Many of these series have analyzed several high risk factors which were predictive of loco-regional recurrence wherein the role of adjuvant post-mastectomy radiation can be considered. Some authors have used combinations of prognostic factors such as age tumour size grade receptor status Her2neu status and lympho-vascular space invasion to define subgroups with more specific risks of loco-regional recurrence than single factors alone. The current trial hypothesizes that ""Post-mastectomy radiation in high risk node negative early breast cancer patients decreases rates of loco-regional recurrence and improves disease free survival"" and propose to address the question in randomized setting.

Breast Cancer,Axillary Reverse Mapping Using Near-infrared Imaging in Invasive Breast Cancer: Predictors of Nodal Positivity, The initial standard treatment of breast cancer is surgery. Tumor involvement of lymph nodes is of paramount importance in the subsequent management of this cancer and surgery of invasive breast cancer involves axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). To preserve arm lymphatic drainage during ALND and avoid the risk of arm lymphedema mapping the lymphatic drainage by axillary reverse mapping (ARM) has been developed. But oncological safety is uncertain. The ARM procedure presented here uses indocyanine green (ICG) and fluorescence detection of draining lymphatics. The project aims to train surgeons to the technique and to identify predictive factors for metastatic ARM nodes in invasive BC using tumor and axillary pathological parameters to better select patients who would not require removal of the ARM node in the future    ,NCT02994225

Breast Cancer,Presential Vs Online Group-based Psychosocial Treatment for Breast Cancer Survivors.," This multicenter study aims to prove the efficacy of a pilot psychosocial evidence-based treatment (Positive Psychotherapy) in two formats (online vs face-to-face) with an online support control group. It develops as a randomized-controlled trial in a group of primary breast cancer survivors assigned to one of the three experimental treatments. The principal dependent variables assessed will be emotional distress post-traumatic growth and QoL. Some treatment predictors of psychosocial response will be explored. Lastly an economic analysis comparing the three psychosocial treatments and focused on the ""quality adjusted life years"" (QALY) will be made. It is expected to find higher efficacy in psychosocial indicators and QALY for Positive Psychotherapy in the two experimental intervention formats than in the online support group. It is hypothesized that the face-to-face format will be more effective for severely distressed patients with previous history of trauma while the online format will be more effective for younger patients with mild emotional distress.
